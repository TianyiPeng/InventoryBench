Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As it is Period 1, there is no historical data yet to observe lead times or confirmed demand patterns beyond the initial samples provided. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) shows an average of ~107.4. Since the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 for the (1+L) period, and L=4, it needs to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods for the first decision to establish a baseline. The 'default' \u03bc\u0302 will calculate (1+4) \xd7 mean(130, 122, 106, 108, 71) = 537. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), the backend will naturally target a lower service level (q=0.5), which is appropriate given the risk of overstocking a product with $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The observation from Period 1 shows a demand of 118 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0, no units were sold. An order of 145 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and be visible at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the 'hidden' samples provided in the prompt) were 130, 122, 106, 108, and 71. However, the system's 'Game History' specifically notes Period 1 demand as 118, which is slightly different from the provided sample list (130). I will prioritize the historical samples provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) for variance calculation while noting the observed value. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. To maintain availability against the 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Average demand is approx 107.4. I'll use recent_N to capture the available history and rely on the OR backend's default logic for lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 284 units in-transit from orders placed in Period 1 (145 units) and Period 2 (139 units). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the sequence, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, no arrivals are expected yet, which explains the current stockout and $0 sales. Demand for Period 1 was 130 (from historical list, though user history says 118, I will stick to the provided historical trend) and Period 2 was 122. The most recent samples (Period 1-5) show a mean of 107.4. Periods 1-4 averaged ~116, but Period 5 (from the historical list provided in prompt) shows a drop to 71. Since I only have 2 periods of game history (118 and 35), and the prompt background data (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), there is a downward trend. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent softening while maintaining a safety buffer. I'll stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (145, 139, and 145 units respectively, totaling 429 units in-transit) have not arrived yet, which is expected as the first order (P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but this is unavoidable given the lead time. Demand history shows Period 1: 118 (user history says 130), Period 2: 35 (user history says 122), Period 3: 140 (user history says 106). There is a discrepancy between the 'GAME HISTORY' text and the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt. I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' provided in the latest status (118, 35, 140) and the prompt's provided P4 demand (108) and P5 demand (71) for a broader view. Average demand across these samples is approximately 94.4. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 0.5) will be conservative. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent spread while waiting for the first delivery to stabilize the pipeline.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). However, as we are at the start of the Period 5 decision phase, we have not yet seen \u2018Period 5 conclude\u2019, so the 0 on-hand inventory is expected. The historical demand data provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) shows a downward trend compared to the demand resolved in the game history (118, 35, 140, 30). Because the game history demand is highly volatile and the game is in its early stages, I will use all available samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no orders have concluded yet, I cannot verify if the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, so I will stick with the default lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in the Period 5 conclude message (4 periods total). However, we have experienced significant lost sales in Periods 1-4 because no inventory was on-hand. Demand observations in the history provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) differ slightly from the demand resolved in the 'conclude' messages (118, 35, 140, 30, 131), suggesting high volatility or perhaps recording errors. The average demand across the first 5 samples provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' is approximately 107.4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Currently, we have 14 units on hand and 333 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). The pipeline is quite full (333 units), which is roughly 3 periods of expected demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of the 5 samples to set mu_hat, while keeping sigma_hat at the default to account for the observed volatility. The OR backend will see the high in-transit amount and likely order a small amount or zero to adjust for the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). Significant lost sales occurred in Periods 1-4 due to zero starting inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory situation is stabilizing after the initial four periods of stockouts. History shows demand in the first 6 periods: 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73 (Mean: 87.8, SD: 49.3). The provided historical demand samples for Periods 1-5 (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) suggest a slightly higher mean of 107.4. Combining these, the average demand is roughly 96. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Including the current decision period, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent volatility while calculating L confirms the 4-period lead time. On-hand + In-transit (80+301=381) is sufficient to cover about 4 periods of demand at the current rate (roughly 96/period), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary incremental order to reach the base stock target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by three arrivals (Orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived with L=4). Demand history shows significant fluctuation (ranging from 30 to 140), but the mean over the last 7 periods is approximately 90.1. Current inventory is healthy: 121 on-hand plus 215 in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P4 (43), P5 (6), P6 (107), and P7 (59). We expect the P4 order (43 units) to arrive during Period 8. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the demand mean and standard deviation since the initial periods had no sales (lost demand), but the demand data itself is available. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Current inventory: On-hand=100, In-transit=287. Game history confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5-8). Historical demand (including Periods 1-4, which were failed sales but recorded as demand) shows: [118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64]. No clear seasonal pattern or regime shift is detected yet due to high volatility; mean demand is ~87 units/period. The pipeline (287) is currently healthy given the L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand, ~435 units needed), so I will use consistent methods. Since lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, 'default' or 'calculate' is appropriate. For demand, the variance is high (std ~42), so I will use all available samples to stabilize the forecast against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (Orders from P1-P5 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P5-P9). Demand shows some volatility but no clear structural shift yet; the average demand across the first 9 periods is approximately 89.8 units (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64, 113). In Period 9, we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0, sold 106 vs. demand 113), indicating we need to maintain a healthier pipeline. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 368 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full experienced demand profile while filtering out the initial zero-inventory period's 'sold' artifacts by looking at actual 'demand' figures. This sets the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand has been approximately 91.7 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival so far (Orders from Periods 1 through 6 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) following a near-stockout in Period 10. There are 342 units in transit (ordered in Periods 7, 8, 9, 10), which are expected to arrive in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (z=0). Setting L=4 (default) and using a recent demand window is appropriate. Since the demand has been relatively stable around 92 with some fluctuations, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 5-10) which reflects real sales once inventory became available. This sets mu_hat to (1+4)*mean(demand_last_6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of recent 'conclude' messages confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals for orders from Periods 3 through 7). Total demand across the 11 historical periods shows some variability but averages around 91.6 units per period. In the last 3 periods, demand has been 113, 103, and 96 (average ~104), and we have experienced stockouts (ended Period 9 and 11 with 0 inventory). To prevent further lost sales while managing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), I will use the last 5 periods of demand (Periods 7-11: 104, 64, 113, 103, 96; Mean = 96) to set mu_hat. This covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (1+L=5). The in-transit pipeline (423 units) consists of orders from P8 (115), P9 (87), P10 (81), and P11 (140). The order from P8 (115 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 12 resolution phase. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will provide a balanced safety stock based on the latest consumption patterns.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12 (all matching L=4). Demand analysis for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mix of historical and actual realized demand. Including the provided historical samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) and the recorded demand from Periods 1-12, the mean demand is approximately 101 units per period. There's no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, though demand varies between 30 and 140. With L=4, the pipeline inventory should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 55 and in-transit is 365 (Total 420). 5 periods of average demand is approx 505 units. My goal is to ensure mu_hat reflects this (1+4) * 101 = 505. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full realized demand history since the start of the game, which stabilizes the estimate better than include the initial historical distribution which had higher variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 14. Starting inventory is 81 units, with 303 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from Periods 5 through 13, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 13 periods shows significant volatility, with recent demands (Periods 12 and 13) dropping to 60 and 61 respectively, compared to higher spikes earlier (e.g., 131 in Period 5, 113 in Period 9). Because there is no clear date context or product seasonal trend provided other than 'Regular Chips', I will rely on recent historical demand to set parameters. The mean demand of the last 8 periods (Periods 6-13) is approximately 84.25. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) covers (1+L)=5 periods of demand (~421 units). Given the high volatility (std dev ~22), I will use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock to handle demand spikes without incurring excessive holding costs, as holding cost equals profit ($1/unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on ten consecutive completed arrival cycles (P1-P10). Demand has shown significant volatility since initial sampling, but recent demand (P12-P14) has averaged approximately 68 units/period, compared to the higher earlier average. We are currently in a lower demand regime relative to the start of the game, although demand spikes up to 113 still occur. With an on-hand inventory of 79 and 260 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), the pipeline is well-stocked. To calibrate the inventory level to the recent demand pattern while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=10) to capture the drift towards lower mean demand while maintaining a buffer for variance. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times are stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean since Period 12: avg last 3 periods is ~68 vs ~94 previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a confirmed regime shift. Early demand (Periods 1-11) averaged approximately 93 units per period. However, since Period 12, the demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 72 units per period (60, 61, 83, 96). While the Period 15 demand of 96 is slightly higher, it still aligns more closely with a reduced mean compared to the earlier high-variance peak periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this updated demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from Periods 1 through 11 arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently 123 with a significant pipeline of 225 units. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend needs to maintain a balanced service level (target q=0.5) to avoid excessive stock. Setting parameters based on the last 4 periods will help normalize the base stock against the recently observed lower demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a significant demand spike in Period 16 (demand=178), which contrasts with the previous lower regime (avg ~68). This suggests either a new high-demand regime or a one-off outlier. Given that on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) and Lead Time is consistently 4 periods, we must ensure enough pipeline inventory to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time. Previous carry-over insights identified a lower regime, but recent data (P15: 96, P16: 178) shows an upward trend. I will adjust mu_hat to use a medium-term 'recent_N' to capture this recent increase without overreacting solely to the outlier. Lead time 'L' remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted upwards again from Period 15: demand for P15-P16 averaged 137 compared to the previous 'stable' average of 68.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history shows a significant demand upshift. Demand in Periods 16 and 17 was 178 and 168 (avg ~173), drastically higher than the previous baseline of approx 90-100. This follows a period of stockouts (P17 ended with 0 inventory). Currently, 346 units are in-transit, but given the 4-period lead time, we must ensure coverage for the next 5 periods (L+1). With demand spiking to ~170, the expected demand over (1+L) periods is approximately 850. The OR backend will order based on (mu_hat - pipeline). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and increase the order volume to prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted upwards significantly at Period 16: average demand increased from ~94 to ~173 (+84%) over the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. The demand values for the last three periods are 178, 168, and 155, resulting in an average of 167. This is a substantial increase compared to the earlier periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 17 and 18 because arrivals (25 and 38 units) were insufficient to meet this new demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this elevated demand level (approx 167 per period). Since L=4, mu_hat will be based on (1+4)*167. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to account for the volatility within this high-demand period. L is set to default (4) as the historical arrivals have been consistent with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand increased from ~94 to ~167 (+77%) based on Periods 16-18. Stockouts occurred in P17-P18 due to this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) was 178, 168, 155, and 114, respectively, averaging approximately 154 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the previous average of around 94. We are currently experiencing stockouts (Period 19 ended with 0 on-hand inventory) despite an arrival of 105 units. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this new regime. Using the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) as our base demand forecast, multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, gives a mu_hat of roughly 770. Since there's high volatility (std dev is significant in this new regime), I will use an explicit sigma_hat. I estimate the standard deviation of the last 4 periods to be approximately 28.3. Scaling this by sqrt(1+L) results in approximately 63.3. This adjustment should help the OR backend raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and recover from the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average demand increased from ~68 to ~154 (+126%) based on Periods 16-19. Continued stockouts observed in P17-P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from P16-P20, we see values of 178, 168, 155, 114, and 145. This averages 152 units per period, representing a ~123% increase compared to the previous stable period (approx 68 units). We have experienced recurrent stockouts since Period 17 because incoming inventory was based on the older, lower demand forecasts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern (P16 order arrived in P20). To capture this high-demand regime and restore inventory levels, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using the last 5 periods (N=5). This ensures we cover the (L+1)=5 periods of demand required by the OR policy while reflecting the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P16-P20): mean demand increased to ~152 units (+123% vs previous regime) with significant stockouts observed in P17-P20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' shifted significantly upward at Period 16. In the most recent period (P21), demand was 131 units, following a sequence of high demand (178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131). The average demand over this high-regime period (P16-P21) is approximately 148.5 units. The inventory situation has slightly improved as the P17 order (176 units) arrived in P21, leaving 45 units on-hand. However, pipeline inventory is quite high (584 units) due to aggressive ordering in P18-P20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the OR backend's service level balancing (profit $1 vs holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this sustained high demand period, ensuring the inventory pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand at the new mean.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P16-P21): mean demand is ~149 units, representing a sustained shift from the previous regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 22, the observed values are: 178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173. The mean demand for this recent high-demand regime (N=7) is approximately 152 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Despite arriving shipments in P21 and P22, significant stockouts in P17-P20 have left us in a fragile position relative to this higher demand level. To maintain high service levels and avoid further stockouts during the L+1 period lead time window, I am setting mu_hat using the mean of the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to reflect this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of this specific period. The lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: Mean demand for P16-P22 is ~152 units (+123% vs previous regime of ~68 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23, the samples are: 178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173, and 130. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 149.25 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 22.4. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 149 and in-transit is 481, totaling 630 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of 149.25, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period is 149.25 * 5 = 746.25. Setting L to 'calculate' (which has stabilized at 4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this high-demand regime specifically while ignoring the lower historical demand periods. This will target a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts seen between Periods 17 and 20.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P23) confirmed with mean ~149.25 and std ~22.4. Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from P16 to P24 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 148.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8. The promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with observed arrivals (P20 order arrived in P24). Consequently, the total demand across the lead time + review period (1+L=5 periods) is projected to be approximately 743.5 units. The OR backend uses a base stock policy where the service level is determined by the cost ratio q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5. At q=0.5, the base stock targets the mean demand (mu_hat). Since we have enough samples (N=9) in this stable high-demand regime, I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this behavior while excluding the previous lower-demand period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (N=10), the mean demand is approximately 148.2 units per period. Prior to Period 16, demand was much lower. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms an actual lead time (W) of 4 (e.g., P21 order arrived in P25, 25-21=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units and in-transit is 563 units. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. My parameters target the new high-demand regime using the last 10 samples to capture the stabilized mean of ~148 and its associated variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 17-20 while managing holding costs appropriately given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher mean (P16-P25): avg ~148 units (+110% vs P12-P15 regime). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the mean is approximately 149.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P26) was 163, leading to a stockout as on-hand inventory was insufficient. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from P17 through P22). With a lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current market behavior better than the full history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the pipeline inventory (589 units) and current demand volatility, aiming to recover from the recent stockout while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27, the mean demand is approximately 148.5 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods 25-27) is 143, 163, 137, maintaining this average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat). With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (Period 16 to 27) to capture this regime accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=12 to reflect the volatility of this specific state.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher mean starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 28 is approximately 144.1 units. Specifically, for the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean is 144.08 and the standard deviation is approximately 19.4. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Using N=13 for the recent high-demand regime is appropriate (regime length = 13). Current on-hand is low (40 units) following a demand of 130 in P28, while in-transit inventory is healthy (573 units). The parameters L=4 (promised/actual), mu_hat (1+L=5 periods of demand), and sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)) based on the last 13 periods will maintain the necessary service level while accounting for the established higher demand plateau and recent volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), demand has averaged approximately 148.5 units. Recent demand in P29 spiked to 187, following a period of relative stability in the 130-140 range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant pending arrivals, I will use a recent window of N=14 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime accurately and N=14 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (std dev in this period is approx 22). This ensures the base stock calculation, which uses profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) to target a 50% service level offset by the safety stock logic, is sufficiently robust to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 and has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 144 units, contrasting with the much lower mean observed in the early periods. Recent volatility is also present, with demand ranging from 114 to 187 units. The promised and actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 35 and 600 units in transit (covering roughly the next 4 periods), my objective is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 allows the OR engine to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the irrelevant data from the first 15 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift since Period 16, but more recent periods (P30-P31) show a potential cooling or stabilization at a slightly lower level (average of 96.5 over the last 2 periods vs. 148 earlier). However, to remain conservative and avoid stockouts given the 4-period lead time, I will use a window (recent_N=16) that captures the high-demand regime from P16 onwards. This balances the hyper-peak seen previously with the recent lower observations. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 16 periods (P16-P31) effectively covers the 'modern' regime while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 shows continued high volatility with a recent slight softening in P30-P31 (~97 units vs ~150 previous avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility since Period 16. While the historical mean for the high-demand regime (P16-P29) was approximately 148, the last three periods (P30-P32) have shown a slight softening, averaging 112 units. Given this recent downward trend and the fact that Holding Costs equal Profit ($1/unit), it is prudent to adjust the forecast to prevent overstock while maintaining enough inventory for the 4-period lead time. I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P28-P32) to capture the current lower mean (~131) and the higher variance observed in recent cycles. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 94 and pipeline is healthy at 479, which covers the expected demand for the upcoming lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~131 = 655). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma allows the backend to adapt to this localized softening while respecting the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed starting Period 30: 3-period average is ~112 units compared to previous high-demand regime average of ~148 units (-24% shift).

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While a 'softening' was tentatively noted in Periods 30-31 (averaging ~97), demand in Periods 32 and 33 returned to high levels (144 and 143 respectively). Therefore, the 'softening' appears to have been a temporary dip rather than a sustained regime shift. The average demand since Period 16 (the start of the high-demand regime) remains around 146 units. Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 50/50, but we aim to prevent stockouts in a volatile environment), I am using L=4 and setting mu_hat based on the last 18 periods (P16-P33) to capture the current high-demand regime mean (approx 146 * 5 = 730). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same range to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand 'softening' noted in P32 was temporary; demand for P32-P33 (avg ~143.5) aligns with the high-demand regime established in Period 16 (avg ~146).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 remains dominant, with Period 34 showing a high demand of 191 units, effectively debunking the 'softening' observed in Periods 30-31. The mean demand from Period 16 to Period 34 is approximately 147.5 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high volatility (std dev remains significant) and the recent spike to 191, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P16-P34) to capture the current high-demand environment while maintaining the stable lead time of 4 periods to avoid over-ordering based on the high lead-time-adjusted base stock. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is substantial (506 units), which should buffer against current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-mean regime starting around Period 16. Although there was a brief dip in Periods 30-31, demand rebounded to 191 in Period 34 and was 134 in Period 35. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) is approximately 140 units, which aligns with the sustained high-demand regime of ~145-150 units. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire game (P1 arrived P5, P30 arrived P34). Given on-hand inventory is relatively low (35 units) and we are in a high-demand phase, I will use a recent_N window for the high-demand regime (starting at P16, so N=20) to capture current mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 periods of demand exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues to be the dominant pattern, despite occasional lower demand points (like Period 36 at 94 units). The mean demand since Period 16 is approximately 144 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Current pipeline inventory is 621 units, which covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand (144 * 4 = 576). However, the system's stock-to-service level needs to account for the demand volatility (std dev since P16 is ~26). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=20 to capture this stable yet volatile high-demand regime, and N=20 for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock. I am setting L to 4 as observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a return to lower levels following the high-demand regime that started in Period 16. In the last five periods (P33-P37), demand was 143, 191, 134, 94, and 91 respectively. The last two periods specifically show a significant drop below 100, which suggests the high-demand regime may be ending or we are entering a lower-demand seasonal phase. Since Period 30, the average demand is approximately 125. However, since we've seen stockouts in the past during transitions, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 to capture the downward trend without over-reacting to the single lowest data points. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all observed concludes (P5-P37), so method 'calculate' is appropriate. The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), but there are 613 units in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of demand at current rates, so the OR backend should scale down new orders appropriately given the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed starting P36: 2-period average is 92.5 units compared to the P16-P35 regime average of ~150 units. Monitoring for sustained shift.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 36-38: 94, 91, 75) confirms a sustained downward shift compared to the earlier high-demand regime (which averaged ~150). The average demand over these last 3 periods is 86.6 units. This signifies a demand softening compared to the volatile period between P16 and P35. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final 11 periods of the game, I am shifting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this lower mean (approx 86.6 * (1+4) = 433). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P30-P34. In-transit inventory (466) is currently sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next few periods, so the OR backend will naturally scale back orders to match the new lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand decreased from ~150 to ~87 (-42%) based on Periods 36-38.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 36. From Periods 36-39, demand values were 94, 91, 75, and 68, resulting in a 4-period average of 82. This is a significant decrease from the previous average of ~150. Based on this confirmed shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new lower demand level and prevent excessive inventory accumulation, especially since the current on-hand inventory (235) and in-transit (275) are quite high relative to the new demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by all recent arrivals.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly downward starting at Period 36, confirmed in carry-over insights at Period 39. The average demand since Period 36 is approximately 80.6 units per period (N=5: 94, 91, 75, 68, 75), compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~148. Current on-hand inventory (323 units) plus in-transit units (112) equals 435 units. This pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), which at the current rate is roughly 403 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the inventory cushion, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the new lower demand level. sigma_hat will also be set using the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 sustained: 5-period average (P36-P40) is ~81 units, a 45% decrease from the previous regime average of ~148.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 36. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is approximately 85.1 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~148. This represents a sustained decrease of about 42%. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P37 order in P41. Current on-hand inventory is 288 units and in-transit is 39 units (total 327). Given the new demand mean of ~85, the pipeline (327 units) covers roughly 3.8 periods of demand. Since the target base stock for a (L+1)=5 period lead time would be approximately 5 * 85 = 425 units, and we have 327, the system will place a moderate order to bridge the gap. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-137.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-mean regime starting around Period 36. The average demand over the last seven periods (P36-P42) is approximately 86.5 units, which is a significant decrease from the previous regime's average of ~148. Current on-hand inventory is 232 units and in-transit is 99 units (ordered Period 42), totaling 331 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean, 5 * 86.5 = 432.5. However, since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it aims for the median demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 units. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this lower demand regime starting at P36 while ignoring the higher volatility of the previous regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 43, the average demand is approximately 85.0 units (n=8), which is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime of ~148 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 158 units and in-transit is 201 units (total 359). The zero arrival in Period 43 is expected because the order from Period 39 was 0 units. In-transit units are from Period 41 (0), Period 42 (99), and Period 43 (102). I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~85) and use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the recent variability. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to the lower demand levels and avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit/holding ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36 and has remained stable at a lower level. Over the last 9 periods (P36-P44), the average demand is approximately 83.5 units, significantly lower than the ~150 units seen previously. We are currently in Period 45 with 96 units on-hand and 267 units in-transit. Arrivals have been zero for the last two periods, which is consistent with the order freeze in Periods 39, 40, and 41. The order placed in Period 39 (which was 0 units) should have arrived in Period 43, and the order placed in Period 40 (0 units) should have arrived in Period 44, explaining the zero arrivals. The order placed in Period 42 (99 units) is expected to arrive in Period 46. To prevent excessive inventory accumulation given the high holding cost and the confirmed lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to reflect the current state (P36-P44). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 36, decreasing from an average of ~150 to a mean of ~81 units. Since Period 41, the demand has continued this lower trend, with the last 5 samples (P41-P45) averaging 78.8 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is currently 41, and in-transit is 317 units. Considering the lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at total coverage for 5 periods of demand ((L+1) = 5). Recent demand (P41-P45) suggests a total requirement for 5 periods of approximately 394 units. Current total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 358 units. To account for the stabilized lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10 to capture the full lower regime stability) and sigma_hat using recent_N similarly to reflect actual volatility in this period. L is set to calculate as lead times have been steady.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 sustained: The average demand from Period 36 to 45 is 79.7 units, significantly lower than the ~148 unit average seen from P16-P35.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 36 and has stabilized at a lower mean. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 46 is approximately 80 units (sum of demand P36-P46 is 895 over 11 periods), which is a 46% decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~148 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture this current regime (from Period 36 to 46). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by the Period 42 order arriving in Period 46. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=11 window to reflect current volatility. Note that zero orders were placed in Periods 39-41, explaining the gaps in arrivals during Periods 43-45. Regular arrivals have resumed as of Period 46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-56.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 36. The mean demand for this recent period (P36-P47) is approximately 79.7 units per period. Although Period 47 saw a slight uptick to 68 units, it remains well within the lower bounds of this regime compared to the earlier high-demand phase (~148 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and an on-hand inventory of 124 plus in-transit stock of 193, we are currently overstocked relative to the remaining expected demand. The inventory pipeline already covers the (~80 units/period * 3 periods) remaining demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the sustained lower demand since Period 36, which will help the backend minimize further excess ordering as we approach the game end.

Daily Profit: $82.00, Daily Holding Cost: $108.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a lower-stabilized regime since Period 36, with the average demand from P36 to P48 being approximately 79 units. Recent demand (P46-P48) has shown a slight uptick (50, 68, 82), but still aligns with this lower-mean regime compared to the previous high-demand phase (~148). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on recent arrival data (P44 order arrived in P48, lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory (108) plus in-transit (192) totals 300 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average of ~79 units/period, required stock is approximately 395 units. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at P36 to P48), we provide the system with the current mean demand profile. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility of this regime. This strategy ensures we maintain sufficient inventory to meet demand while managing holding costs as we head into the final periods of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 36. The mean demand from Period 36 to 49 is approximately 78.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P49) was 73 units, consistent with this regime. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 85 and in-transit inventory at 226 (total pipeline = 311), and an expected demand of ~78 per period, the pipeline covers approximately 4 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=14 (the length of the current stable regime from P36-P49) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level appropriate for this lower demand environment, effectively balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus safety stock for variance).
