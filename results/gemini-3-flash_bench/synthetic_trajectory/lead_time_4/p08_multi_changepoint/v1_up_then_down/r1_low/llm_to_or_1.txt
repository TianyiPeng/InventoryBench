Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no orders in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period_1: 130, Period_2: 122, Period_3: 106, Period_4: 108, Period_5: 71. Since these look like historical samples but we are only starting the game at Period 1, I will use these samples to estimate the initial demand. The mean demand of these 5 samples is 107.4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' methods, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * mean(samples) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4) * std(samples). This provides a conservative starting point to build up inventory given the initial 0 stock and 4-period lead time delay.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 145 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). Demand for Period 1 was 107, but since starting inventory was 0, sales were 0. We are currently in Period 2. The sample demand data provided (P1: 130, P2: 122, P3: 106, P4: 108, P5: 71) differs slightly from the game history for Period 1 (demand=107), suggesting either variance or a slight mismatch in history. I will use the 'default' methods initially to gather more data on lead time and demand stability. The OR engine will use the promised lead time (L=4) and historical mean to set the base stock level (mu_hat across L+1 periods). Given profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, which the OR engine's lookup will handle correctly to minimize total cost.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, leading to missed sales because orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 are still in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we don't expect the Period 1 order to arrive until the end of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). The current history reflects high demand (Period 1: 107, Period 2: 149) significantly exceeding the initial sample mean (approx. 107). I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift in demand while maintaining the default promised lead time (L=4) until actual arrivals provide evidence of a different lead time. Setting L to default and using a 2-period window for demand helps the OR backend adjust the base stock to cover the clearly higher current demand levels.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 463 units in-transit. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 107.4 units/period with a standard deviation of about 24.3 (based on P1-P5 samples: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, no orders have arrived yet (first arrival expected at Period 5). Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the service level (q) target is 0.50 (z=0), meaning the policy will aim to maintain a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid over-ordering before inventory arrives and to smooth out the recent low demand in Period 5 (71), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full sample set while the pipeline fills.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). However, as of the start of Period 5 (reading Period 4 conclude), no units have arrived and on-hand inventory remains 0, resulting in lost sales. The current 'In-transit' balance of 531 units matches the sum of orders from P1-P4 (145+141+177+68=531). Historical demand samples show a downward trend (130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The average demand over the 5 known periods is 107.4. Given the lead time L=4, the review+lead window is (1+L)=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this downward trend while maintaining a buffer for the expected arrival. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time, I will stick with the default promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (ordered Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. Demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided in system prompt: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71; versus recorded in history: 107, 149, 96, 92, 125) shows a mean around 110-115 units per period. Current on-hand is low (20), but we have a large pipeline (386) consisting of orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4. Since the lead time is confirmed as 4, we expect the Period 2 order to arrive at the end of this period (Period 6). I will use the default lead time (4) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available historical samples (N=5) to stabilize the forecast, as there is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The stock-out that characterized Periods 1-4 has ended now that arrivals have stabilized. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current demand over the last 6 periods shows a mean of 111.6 and a standard deviation of 20.3. There is a slight downward trend in the most recent demand samples (125, 101), but with only two data points, it is not yet a sustained regime shift. The inventory position is currently 60 on-hand + 398 in-transit = 458 total. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * 111.6 = 558. The pipeline is slightly lower than the target base stock, so we will order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full active history while lead time is stable at 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly in 4 periods (arriving at the start of Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively). Therefore, the lead time is stable at L=4. Demand history (Periods 1-7) shows values: 107, 149, 96, 92, 125, 101, 107. The mean demand is approximately 111 with a standard deviation of 19. No significant regime shift is detected in demand levels or lead times. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it aligns with the observed 4-period consistency. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to capture the overall volatility and mean, which provides a stable base-stock calculation for the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analysis of lead times from Period 5 through Period 8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as promised). Demand has stabilized after initial fluctuations; the last 8 periods of demand are [107, 149, 96, 92, 125, 101, 107, 86], with a mean of approximately 107.8. The current on-hand inventory is 112 units, with 350 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To ensure optimal base-stock levels that balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level offset by the safety factor in the OR backend's capped policy), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters. This captures the full available history which shows a relatively stable mean and standard deviation. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is currently accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1 to Period 4 all arrived with a lead time of 4 periods. However, in Period 9, the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in an arrival of 0, as expected. Demand has shown a downward trend from a peak of 149 in Period 2 to 76 in Period 9. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 99 units. Since the lead time (L) is consistently 4, the cover period (L+1) is 5. Using recent demand data (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will better reflect the recent cooling in demand compared to the initial high-demand periods. I am setting L to 4 as established by multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The pipeline inventory is 428 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9), which should arrive in P10, P11, P12, and P13 respectively.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P1-P5, P2-P6, P3-P7, P4-P8, P6-P10). Note: The P5 order was 0, resulting in the 'arrived=0' at P9, which is consistent with the lead time. Demand remains stable without clear trend shifts. The mean demand over 10 periods is 107.9, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods is 101.2. Given equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which aligns base stock closely with mean demand over the (L+1) window. I will use the default lead time (4) and base the demand statistics on all 10 available samples to maintain stability, as no significant regime shift is detected beyond normal variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand across periods 1-11 shows an average of approximately 109 units per period (range 76-149). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend currently, so I will use a larger sample window (N=11) to capture the overall mean and volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1), Period 6 (from P2), Period 7 (from P3), Period 8 (from P4), Period 10 (from P6), and Period 11 (from P7). Note that for Period 9, 'arrived=0' is expected because no order was placed in Period 5. The system currently sits at an on-hand inventory of 31 with 349 units in-transit. By setting L to default (4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to the mean/std of all 11 observed demand samples, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that covers (1 + 4) = 5 periods of demand, ensuring we maximize profit while penalizing for significant holding costs, which are equal to profit per unit ($1.0).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 23 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 399 units. Analysis of concluded periods (P5-P8, P10-P12) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (ordered P(N) arrives P(N+4)). This matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows a mean of 108.5 units across all 12 periods. Recent demand (P10-P12) is slightly higher (avg 121), while P5-P9 was lower (avg 99). There is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, so I will use a larger N to smooth out volatility. For L, I will use 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full historical average while weighting towards recent values. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=12 to account for the observed demand variance. This configuration allows the OR backend to maintain a safety stock that balances the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (target service level ~50%).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent range between 63 and 149 units. Based on the last 13 periods, the mean demand is approximately 105 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13). Note that Period 5 had an order of 0, which corresponds to the 'arrived=0' at Period 9 (conclude). The system currently has 38 units on hand and 442 units in transit (orders from P10-P13). I will use the promised lead time of 4 and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the full sample set as there are no strong indicators of a demand regime shift yet.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 460 in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 14 (demand 87, sold 69). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as verified by arrival logs (P1->P5, P2->P6, ..., P10->P14). Historical demand across 14 periods shows an average of approximately 103.7 units/period. However, recent demand fluctuates between 63 and 136. To prevent further stockouts and account for the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand including the decision period), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand stability since the early periods. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate given the actual lead time matches the promised lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability but with a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (mean ~88.2). Using all historical data (mean ~103.8) would overestimate current demand, while using too few samples might overreact to the P13 dip (63). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-initial-startup demand levels (averaging ~98.6). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P11 (except for the P5 order which appears to be potentially missing/delayed as it did not arrive in P9, but lead times for others remained exactly 4). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 360 units (orders from P12-P15), which covers the incoming demand for the Lead Time + 1 horizon. My parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of demand (~493 units) to ensure high service levels while managing holding costs which equal profit per unit ($1).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility, with a significant spike in Period 16 (178 units) compared to the historical average (approx. 106). Current on-hand inventory is low (9 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical conclusions (e.g., P12 order arriving in P16). I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent upward trend and increased variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand while accounting for recent volatility. This protects against potential stockouts if the Period 16 spike heralds a new trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift starting around Period 16. In Period 16, demand was 178, and in Period 17, it spiked to 222. Prior to this, demand typically hovered between 60 and 140. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal spike. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there are 363 units in-transit, the immediate demand needs to be addressed with a higher base stock. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion messages from Period 5 to 17). To capture the recent spike without overreacting too aggressively, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to overweight the recent high observations (103, 178, 222). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with the demand spike. For lead time L, I'll stick with default as it matches the promised and observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~100 to 178 (P16) and 222 (P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero with high demand over the last three periods (178, 222, 146), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights. Since P16, the average demand is approximately 182 units per period, compared to the previous average of ~100. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new rate. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 581 units, which covers about 3.2 periods of the new demand. To adjust for the increased demand and high stockout risk, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (since the shift) and using the explicit method to set L to 4. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 3 samples to reflect the increased volatility in the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has averaged 175.25 units (178, 222, 146, 155), significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. Due to the 4-period lead time, the smaller orders placed before this spike (from Periods 14 and 15) are currently arriving, leading to stockouts (on-hand 0). We have a large pipeline of 782 units (including orders from P16-P19), but we must ensure the OR backend continues to target a high base stock to satisfy this new demand level once the larger orders start arriving in P20/P21. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~175. L is stable at 4 periods. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the backend's target service level is 50%, making an accurate mean (mu_hat) critical to minimize the impact of stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs once the pipeline arrives.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. While demand spiked to 178 (P16) and 222 (P17), the most recent three periods (P18-P20) show demand of 146, 155, and 98, suggesting the peak may be stabilizing or retreating, but remains higher than the pre-P16 average (~100). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is recovering from stockouts caused by this surge. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the volatility and the recent downward movement in Period 20, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the recent fluctuations. I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this new regime (roughly P16-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 21, the values are [178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172], which averages 161.83. This is significantly higher than the earlier average of approximately 107. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P12-P17). I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=6 ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock based on the last 6 periods (Period 16-21) of demand history, multiplied by (1+L). The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (6 units), and there is a large in-transit pipeline (621 units), so the OR engine will determine the final order by subtracting the pipeline from the high-regime base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~107 to 162 (last 6 periods average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the 15 periods prior, demand averaged ~107 units. Since Period 16 (the last 7 periods), demand has averaged approximately 159.6 units (178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172, 146). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages. To align the OR backend with this new higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7, which captures the shift. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility observed since the regime change. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to use the consistently observed actual lead time of 4. This configuration ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is calculated based on current demand levels (~160/avg) rather than the lower long-term average (~123/avg), thus maintaining a high service level while managing on-hand inventory.

Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 samples), the average has increased to approximately 155.38 units per period (178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172, 146, 164), compared to the pre-shift average of ~107. The standard deviation for this period is approximately 35.8. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 21, 22, and 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 208 and in-transit is 426. Since the lead time is 4, the target pipeline (mu_hat) must cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to appropriately calculate the base stock for this higher demand level while considering the 4-period lead time. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the stable observed lead time history.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean is approximately 156.5 (samples: 178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172, 146, 164, 124). The standard deviation in this high-demand regime is roughly 36.6. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10-13, 15-17, 18-24). Currently, on-hand inventory is 179 and in-transit is 498. Since the lead time is 4, we must plan for a 5-period window (L+1). With the current profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (critical ratio), meaning the base stock should align closely with the median demand over the protection interval. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this established higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~107 to ~156 (P16-P24 average). Standard deviation in this regime is approx 37.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the demand samples are: 178, 222, 146, 155, 98, 172, 146, 164, 124, 112. The mean of this specific regime (N=10) is approximately 151.7. This is significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average of ~107. Although recent demand (P24, P25) has slightly softened, I will maintain a focus on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher mean while acknowledging the volatility (sigma). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' messages. With on-hand inventory at 81 and a large in-transit pipeline (588), the backend OR engine needs parameters reflective of this higher demand regime to ensure adequate stock while managing the holding cost, which equals profit. A base stock levels targeting the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) helps navigate the lead time of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 16. In the first 15 periods, demand averaged approximately 107. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-26), the demand has averaged approximately 144 units per period (1582 total / 11 periods), though recent periods show a slight stabilization around 130-140. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock calculation must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect this higher demand regime that started at Period 16. The high on-hand and in-transit inventory currently covers several periods of demand, so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the high service level dictated by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting the 50th percentile/median of demand since q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stabilized: Periods 16-26 average is 144 units/period (prev ~107). Standard deviation in this new regime is approximately 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 16 is well-established. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 162 units, compared to the pre-P16 average of approximately 107. The most recent demand (P27) was 181. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 for mu_hat correctly captures this higher mean demand for the backend. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods across the history (e.g., P23 order arrived P27). Therefore, L is set to 'default' (promised lead time of 4). For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=12 is used to capture the volatility of the current regime. These parameters allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the increased volume and variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 28 is approximately 158 units per period, compared to the pre-regime shift mean of ~107. Recent volatility has also increased; the standard deviation over this new regime (N=13) is approximately 36. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations (e.g., Period 28 concluded an order placed in Period 24). For Period 29, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of the last 13 samples (158.4 * 5 = 792) to reflect the current demand regime. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of these last 13 samples (36 * sqrt(5) \u2248 80). Current on-hand inventory is low (28) but pipeline inventory is high (528), so these parameters will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock to cover the lead time while accounting for the higher demand mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand is now ~158 units (based on P16-P28), up from ~107. Standard deviation in this regime is approx 36.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the current regime (Periods 16-29), the average demand is approximately 159.2 units per period, compared to the initial average of ~107. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 16, demand has shown increased volatility and sustained higher levels, with recent periods (P27-P29) showing demand values of 181, 212, and 175. To capture this new baseline and ensure sufficient stock to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am using a 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the entire new regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to reflect the higher mean demand while accounting for the increased variance observed in this period. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to 175 demand vs 132 available units in Period 29, so maintenance of the pipeline is critical. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and well-documented in the history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~107 to a higher, more volatile level. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 157.3 units with a standard deviation of 37.8. Demand in the last few periods has been particularly strong (averaging 171.3 over P27-P30), leading to stockouts in P29 and P30. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P30 shows the P26 order arriving). With on-hand inventory at 0 and rising demand, I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture this new regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the increased variance, helping to mitigate the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: confirmed mean of ~157 and standard deviation of ~38 based on P16-P30 data.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~107 to ~156. Analysis of the demand from Period 16 to Period 31 (16 samples) shows a mean of 156.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 38.3. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on lead_time observations in the history (e.g., Period 31 conclusion shows Period 27's order arrived exactly on time). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 646 units in-transit. Applying the recent_N method with N=16 to both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current demand regime's properties while filtering out the lower demand from the first 15 periods. Setting L to 'default' uses the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now well-established. Over the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 155.6 units, while the mean over the most recent 10 periods (P23-P32) is approximately 153.2. This indicates a stable higher demand level compared to the initial regime (mean ~107). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 and pipeline (in-transit) is 587. Using N=17 for the current demand regime provides a robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (+/- safety stock), calibrated for the profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting L=4 (promised) as it remains reliable.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. For Period 34, I analyzed the mean and variance since Period 16 (18 samples). The mean demand in this regime is approx 155 units/period, and the standard deviation is approximately 38. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (ordered P29, arrived P33). On-hand inventory is 72, and in-transit inventory is 507, which covers about 3.7 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean accurately while using the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime since Period 16: Mean ~155, Std Dev ~38. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the first 15 periods, mean demand was approximately 107. Since Period 16, the mean demand has stabilized around 155 units with a standard deviation of approximately 38. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as evidenced by the last several arrival conclusions (e.g., Period 34 concluded an order from Period 30). I will use N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (Period 16 to 34) to capture this current regime accurately. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward a base stock that balances service level and inventory costs near the median. My parameters reflect this 5-period window (L+1) of demand coverage.

The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (making L+1 = 5). I am using recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility. The OR backend will compute a base stock based on these parameters to cover the lead time plus current period (5 periods total). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~107 to ~155. However, Period 36 showed a significant drop to 46 units. I need to determine if this is a new regime shift or a one-time anomaly. Looking at the history, the demand in the 'new' regime (since P16) has fluctuated between 98 and 222. The 46 is lower than any previous observation. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the behavior since the last major shift, which will naturally start incorporating this lower value while still being anchored by the established mean. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods since the beginning (observed in almost every 'conclude' message). The in-transit inventory is high (655), reflecting the elevated orders placed recently to meet the higher demand mean. I will maintain the current forecast regime parameters to avoid overreacting to a single low demand point (P36), while allowing the OR backend to adjust slightly via the recent average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown more volatility recently. While the regime since Period 16 established a mean of ~155, the last two periods (P36: 46 units, P37: 95 units) show a significant dip. However, looking at the carry-over insights and the overall history, demand spikes and drops are common. The current 'In-transit' of 530 units covers roughly 3.4 periods of demand at the established mean of 155. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50% (the base stock calculation uses this q). To avoid over-reacting to the very recent two-period dip while still accounting for the regime shift since P16, I will use a recent_N of 22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the data from Period 16 to Period 37. This balances the higher earlier demand in this regime with the recent lower demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from ~107 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 38, the mean is approximately 149.6 units with a standard deviation of 40.5. Although some recent periods (36-38) show slightly lower demand (46, 95, 111), this variance is consistent with the shift observed since P16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 231 and In-transit at 408 (total 639), and L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At a mean of ~150, 5 periods equals 750 units. My parameters will reflect the higher demand regime (N=23 for the last 23 periods since P16) to ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the increased mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-189.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a notable decrease in the last four periods (P36-P39: 46, 95, 111, 93), contrasting with the previous higher mean of ~155. This suggests a potential return toward the original baseline or a new lower regime. However, since the Carry-over Insights require 3+ periods of consistent evidence and this shift is relatively fresh and somewhat volatile, I am transitioning the forecast using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to catch this downward trend without overreacting too aggressively. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Current inventory (on-hand 282 + in-transit 367 = 649) is relatively high compared to recent demand, so the backend's capped policy will likely reduce the order size to prevent excessive holding costs. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N to reflect the current period's variability.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift detected starting Period 36: Recent 4-period mean dropped to ~86 units, significantly lower than the P16-P35 mean of ~155.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 36. Following a high-demand period (P16-P35 avg ~155), the last 5 periods (P36-P40) have shown a much lower average demand of 89 units (46, 95, 111, 93, 100). The current on-hand inventory (345) and in-transit (204) are very high relative to this new demand level, as they were ordered based on the previous higher forecast. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking during this period of high inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: average demand dropped from ~155 down to ~89 (observed P36-P40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-190.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 36, where demand dropped from an average of ~155 to ~89 (Periods 36-41). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With current on-hand inventory at 274 units and in-transit at 191 units, and given a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the goal is to reduce excess inventory to match the new lower demand level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (Periods 36-41) to capture this lower mean (~89.8) and standard deviation (~23.6). The OR backend's service level logic (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will naturally target a base stock near the mean. Setting N=6 focuses the forecast entirely on the current post-shift regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 42, the average demand is 77.8 units (measurements: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66), which is much lower than the previous regime (~155 units). Current on-hand inventory is 296 units with 103 units in transit, totaling 399 units. Given the new low-demand environment, the current inventory level is very high (covering approximately 5 periods of demand). To minimize holding costs while the backend policy (which is based on the OR parameters and current inventory) adjusts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture this new lower-demand regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~155 to ~78 (observed P36-P42, N=7).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. Prior to this, demand averaged ~155 units, but over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the mean has dropped to approximately 75.8 units (samples: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61). We have 338 units on-hand and 26 units in-transit (ordered P43), totaling 364 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4 periods, this inventory covers approximately 4.8 periods of current demand (364 / 75.8), which is slightly above the L+1 window of 5. The OR backend needs to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking and high holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this new lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-158.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36. From P36 to P44 (9 periods), the demand has averaged approximately 83.3 units (46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61, 90). This is a significant drop from the previous average of ~155. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P36-P39 appearing exactly 4 periods later. The Current Period 44 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', which is expected because the order from Period 40 (0 units) would arrive now. The pipeline inventory (72 units) is low, but the on-hand inventory (248 units) is quite high relative to the new demand level (83 units/period). To allow the backend to adjust the base stock correctly for this new lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the data since the Period 36 shift. I am keeping L as 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 36: mean demand decreased to ~83 units based on P36-P44 data (N=9).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 36. Analyzing the data from Period 36 to Period 45 (N=10), the mean demand is approximately 84.6 units per period. The standard deviation in this recent regime is approximately 20.3. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (L=4). The OR backend calculation for base stock uses (1+L) periods, so mu_hat should target approximately 5 * 84.6 \u2248 423 units. Given the inventory position (On-hand: 148, In-transit: 167, Total: 315), and the lower demand, the system needs to adjust to this 'new normal' to avoid excessive holding costs. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this shifted regime effectively while balancing service level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 36: mean demand has stabilized at ~85 units with a standard deviation of ~20 (based on P36-P45, N=10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36. Since then (P36-P46, N=11), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 82 units per period with a standard deviation of about 23 units. My previous carry-over insights noted a drop to ~85, and current full-period analysis confirms this lower level (P36-P46: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61, 90, 100, 53). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4), meaning we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. On-hand inventory is 95, and in-transit is 275 (ordered P43: 26, P44: 46, P45: 95, P46: 108). Total pipeline inventory is 275 + 95 = 370. Expected 5-period demand (1+L=5) at the current rate is ~410. To maintain the service level while accounting for the lower demand regime and ensuring the OR backend uses the correct local statistics, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the post-P36 behavior accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36. Since Period 36, demand has averaged approximately 83 units (N=12), moving from an earlier higher mean of ~155. Recent periods (P44-P47) show demand of 90, 100, 53, and 81, supporting this lower regime. On-hand inventory is currently 40 units, with 288 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 47 of the order from Period 43. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the backend will target the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=12 to capture the current demand mean (~83) and variance (std ~20) since the shift at Period 36, ensuring the OR backend uses the most relevant data for the current low-demand environment to avoid excessive holding costs in these final periods.

Daily Profit: $80.00, Daily Holding Cost: $6.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36 and has stabilized. For the most recent 13 periods (P36-P48), the mean demand is 83.07 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.35. Since the simulation ends at Period 50, and we are currently at Period 49, any order placed now (L=4) will not arrive before the game ends. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use the recent 13-period window (N=13) to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N for both aligns the forecast with the current stabilized lower demand levels (~83 units/period) while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 36. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 36 to Period 49 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 80 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving consistently 4 periods after placement (e.g., P45 order arriving in P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (12 units), but in-transit inventory is significant (307 units), consisting of orders from P46 (108), P47 (39), P48 (81), and P49 (79). To maintain a proper balance while accounting for the lower demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current state for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and using the default lead time (4) which matches observations.
