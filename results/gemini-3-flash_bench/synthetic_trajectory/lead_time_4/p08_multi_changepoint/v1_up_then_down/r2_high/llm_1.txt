In a vending context, demand for plain chips is generally stable, but historical data shows a downward trend (130 -> 122 -> 106 -> 108 -> 71). The average demand over the last 5 periods is ~107. (b) The most recent period (P5) saw a sharp drop to 71. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, I must plan for demand over L+1 = 5 periods. (c) There are no orders in transit and 0 on-hand inventory. (d) Since actual lead time is unknown but promised at 4, I will target a stock level to cover 5 periods of demand. (e) Using the average demand of ~107 per period, the required stock for 5 periods is ~535. Given the recent drop to 71, a slightly more conservative average of 100 seems appropriate to balance stockout risk vs holding costs. Therefore, I will order 500 units to establish the pipeline.",

Total inventory available through the end of the game (P44-P50) is 345 + 50 + 50 + 0 + 225 = 670 units. Forecasted demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) at ~90 units/period is 630 units. Since current on-hand plus in-transit (670) already exceeds the total expected demand (630) for the remainder of the session, no further orders are necessary to avoid excessive holding costs.",

My current on-hand inventory (278) is likely sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the game. Furthermore, an order of 225 units placed in P43 is expected to arrive in P47 (visible P48), which will significantly increase holding costs without contributing to sales, as the game concludes at P50.
