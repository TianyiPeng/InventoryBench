Period 1's actual demand was 118, which is within the normal range. There is no evidence of a regime shift yet.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 145 (from Period 1).

The P2 demand (35) is significantly lower than average, suggesting potential variability or a downward shift, though it is too early to confirm a regime change. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 289. Total positions is 289. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 155 units based on its base-stock calculation. 5.

Period 46 (Period_46) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by order arrivals from Periods 1-40. Current inventory status reflects on-hand stock of 252 units and in-transit inventory of 200 units (ordered in Periods 41-45: 0, 0, 0, 120, 80). The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 35, moving from an average of ~145 to ~83 units per period (P35-P45). Calculating for the lead-time window (L+1 = 5 periods), the expected demand is approximately 415 units (5 * 83). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 452 units (252 + 200). This suggests we already have enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods. However, the game concludes in 5 periods (Period 50), and any order placed now (Period 46) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 50. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) and the desire to avoid stockouts in the final period, I will place a small order to nudge the total inventory position closer to the OR recommendation of 176, but primarily to maintain a buffer. Since current stock (452) already exceeds the 5-period demand (415), and the OR recommendation is quite high (it likely hasn't fully adjusted to the recent demand drop or is over-weighting older, higher demand samples), I will order 50 units. This ensures that total availability for the remainder of the game is robust without incurring excessive holding costs.",

This means any order placed in Period 47 will arrive in the \u2018Arrival Resolution\u2019 phase of Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering any units now will only incur procurement costs and increase the 'In-transit' figure without ever arriving to satisfy demand or generate profit. Current on-hand inventory is 202 units. Recent demand (Periods 44-46) has stabilized around 50-62 units per period (average ~56). With 202 units on hand and 4 periods of demand remaining (Periods 47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 224 units (56 * 4). While there is a slight risk of a minor stockout in the final period (Period 50), any order placed now would not arrive in time to fix it. Consequently, the optimal move is to order 0 units and maximize the utility of existing stock.",
