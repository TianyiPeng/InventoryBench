Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand forecasting, we have 5 historical samples: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82. The mean of these samples is 96.8 and the standard deviation is 21.05. Since we are at the start of the exercise with no confirmed regime shifts or seasonality (no dates provided), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to calculate base-stock levels based on all available historical demand samples and the promised lead time of 4. The base stock will aim to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (1/(1+1)).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 132 units were ordered but, as expected with a promised lead time of 4, they have not arrived yet. Since we started with 0 inventory, the first period's demand of 120 units was lost (sold=0), and we currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The 132 units ordered in P1 are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5. Historical demand shows variability (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). The mean demand across all 5 provided samples is 96.8. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock should cover 1+L = 5 periods. I am using 'default' for L since no arrivals have occurred to verify actual lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use 'default' (which calculates (1+4)*mean) to leverage the 5 historical samples provided in the prompt. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' to capture the variability from those samples. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 4. This means the order placed in Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (readable at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 268 units in transit (132 from P1 + 136 from P2). Demand observed so far (P1: 120, P2: 90) averages 105. Since we haven't received any shipments yet, we cannot infer a change in lead time and will stick to the default L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the available samples (P1-P5 from historical data: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of 96.8. Given the limited data and no clear seasonal shift yet, I will use the default methods, which calculate base stock using all available samples and the promised lead time (L=4). Base stock will cover 1+4 = 5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units), Period 2 (136 units), and Period 3 (132 units) are currently in-transit and totaling 400 units. According to the execution sequence, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 means N+L). Consequently, we will only see the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand (Periods 1-3) has been lost as 'sold=0'. The demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of approximately 96.8 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and have not yet observed a completed lead-time cycle to confirm or refute the promised L=4, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the most recent volatility as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (Arrival Resolution Phase happens after the Decision Phase). Therefore, we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages confirming arrivals. The total in-transit quantity of 510 units accounts for the orders placed in Periods 1-4 (132 + 136 + 132 + 110 = 510). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 96.8 units per period (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). Since there is no actual arrival confirmed yet, I will maintain L at the default promised value of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), use the average of all available samples (N=5) to cover the review period plus lead time (1+L=5). Sigma_hat will also use the default calculation based on all historical samples to handle volatility. No changepoints or lost shipments are evident yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, Period 1's order arrived at the start of Period 5 (after Period 4's conclusion), confirming a lead time (L) of 4 periods as promised. Our on-hand inventory is 15. In-transit inventory is 378 units (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4). Calculating demand: the observed demand for Periods 1-5 consists of 120, 90, 102, 72, 117 (Mean = 100.2, Std Dev \u2248 18.2). Since the lead time is stable at 4, the demand across (L+1) periods (5 periods) is approximately 501. The in-transit + on-hand totals 15 + 378 = 393. This is slightly below the expected 500 units needed to cover the cycle. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean while using the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived at the start of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Based on the game history, orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 arrived in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, confirming a lead time (L) of 4. The promised lead time is also 4, and the observed data matches this consistently. Demand for chips(Regular) over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of ~93.8 and a standard deviation of ~22.6. In-transit inventory is currently 350, which includes orders from Period 3 (132), Period 4 (110), and Period 6 (108). Period 5 had no order. The on-hand inventory is 89. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it aligns with observations, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the historical mean and variance of all available samples (N=6), which provides a stable baseline for this stage of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we see the 'Period 7 conclude' message confirming that the order from Period 3 arrived with a lead time of 4 periods. This validates the promised lead time of 4 is stable (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 98 units with 255 units in-transit. Demand over the first 7 periods has shown significant variability: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123. The mean demand is approximately 98 with a standard deviation of 23. Since the lead time is L=4, we must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the backend to use all available demand data to calculate the base stock. The service level (q) is 0.5 (Profit 1.0 / (Profit 1.0 + Holding 1.0)), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), we aim for a lean inventory to avoid high penalties from ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods (P5-P8) confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 98.4 units per period across 13 samples (8 period history + 5 provided samples). Recent demand (last 4 periods) is slightly higher at ~106 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively equals the expected demand over (L+1) periods (5 periods). Current on-hand is 86 and in-transit is 282, totaling 368 units. This pipeline currently covers approximately 3.5 periods of average demand. To stabilize against the lead time of 4, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the volatility observed since inventory replenishment began in Period 5. This will ensure the OR backend projects demand over the next 5 periods (1 current + 4 lead time) using the most relevant recent data (N=5).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) after a stockout in Period 9. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 410 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (108), Period 7 (37), Period 8 (137), and Period 9 (128). History shows a stable lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). No order was placed in Period 5, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 9. We expect the Period 6 order (108 units) to arrive during Period 10 (visible in P11). Historical demand (including samples P1-P5) shows a mean of 98.4. Recent demand (P1-P9) averages 101.9. Since there's no strong seasonal evidence or regime shift, I will use recent_N for both mean and variance to capture the slight uptick in demand while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). The order from Period 5 (ordered 0 units) explains the lack of arrivals in Period 9, leading to the current stockout. The mean demand across all 10 periods remains stable (approx. 100.9 units), but recent demand (Periods 5-10) is slightly higher (avg 107.3). Given the critical shortage (On-hand: 0) and the high cost of stockouts (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target, but with 0 inventory, we are failing to meet basic demand), I will set mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand levels and ensure the base stock is calculated appropriately for a 4-period lead time. I'm using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to responsive to the most recent demand variability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 490 units in transit. Reviewing the delivery history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent: P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7, P4 in P8, P6 in P10, and P7 in P11 (all L=4). However, the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) explains the lack of arrival in Period 9, causing the current stockout. We expect the shipment from Period 8 (137 units) to arrive during Period 12 (visible in P13). Demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend visible in the data so far (mean approx 100). Given high lead time (L=4) and the current stockout, we need to maintain a robust base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=11 (all available data from the game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand appears to be a single regime with a mean of approx 100 and standard deviation approx 19.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 34 units with an in-transit pipeline of 374 units. Historical demand shows a stable mean of approximately 103 units per period (Periods 1-12 average \u2248 103). The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 (note: Period 5 order arrived in Period 9 and appears to be lost or significantly delayed, as it has not 'concluded'). Given the target service level q = 0.5 (where profit $1.0 = holding cost $1.0), the base stock should roughly cover the expected demand during the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand shows no major regime shifts, so I will use a recent window of 12 periods (all available history including lead-up) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the stockouts seen in Periods 9-11 while preventing over-ordering given the equalized profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms this (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P9 arrived P13). All orders placed so far have either arrived or are within the 4-period window. Specifically, orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13 (totaling 100+125+21+104 = 350 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P14, P15, P16, and P17 respectively. Demand has been relatively stable, with periodic spikes. The average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 103 units. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the full demand history while L is maintained at the confirmed 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the OR backend use the observed stability of the lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13) will provide a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1, with a mean around 102 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across almost all observed arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14). Note that P9's arrive was 0 because no order was placed in P5. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the target service level is approximately 0.50. This implies we should target a base stock near the mean demand over (L+1) periods (5 periods). The current system has an on-hand inventory of 61 and an in-transit pipeline of 323, totaling 384 units of coverage. Given a mean demand of ~102, 5 periods of demand is approximately 510 units. I will use the recent_N method (N=14, spanning the full game history) to capture the stable mean and variance while adapting to the consistent 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6, ..., P11 order arrived P15). Demand has been relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend visible in the numeric sequence. The average demand across the last 15 periods is approximately 104 units. Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will provide a stable estimate of the demand distribution. Because the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. A base stock policy targeting the 50th percentile (the mean) will balance holding costs and stockout risks. We have 84 units on hand and 324 in transit (from orders in periods 12, 13, 14, and 15), totaling 408 units. Given L=4 and mean demand ~104, the pipeline inventory should cover (4+1)*104 = 520 units. The OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on the provided L=4 and history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by delivery history (P12 order arrived in P16, lead_time 4). Historical demand across 16 periods shows a mean of approximately 98.4 units per period (1575 total demand / 16 periods). However, looking at the last 8 periods (P9-P16), the mean is slightly lower at 100.1, and the current on-hand inventory is 47 with 405 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P13, P14, P15, and P16). Based on the (L+1) logic (L=4, so demand for 5 periods), we should forecast for a total demand of approximately 500 units. The pipeline (405) + on-hand (47) = 452 units, which is close to the expected demand of 492 (5 * 98.4). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with setting mu_hat precisely at the expected demand. I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around an average of 100 units per period. Recent performance shows frequent periods with zero ending inventory, suggesting stockouts (as seen in P11 and P17). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P5 through P17). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 346 units in transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). One order of 73 units placed in P14 is expected to arrive during the resolution of P18. To ensure we meet demand and buffer against variability while minimizing stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (from P5 onwards, after the initial lead-time gap) to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 104 units over the last 18 periods (excluding the first 4 periods of zero sales due to lead time). The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a high 'In-transit' quantity of 420 units. This in-transit total accounts for orders placed in Period 15 (126 units), Period 16 (102 units), Period 17 (45 units), and Period 18 (147 units). The order from Period 15 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 19) and become visible at the start of Period 20. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it aligns with the promised and observed 4-period duration. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the stable demand regime observed since sales began in Period 5. This will provide a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=14 to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the arrival history (e.g., Period 15 order arrived at the end of Period 19, visible at start of P20). Demand for the last 19 periods has averaged 104 units with moderate volatility (std dev approx 23). There is no specific seasonal signal in the product 'chips(Regular)' at this generic stage. On-hand inventory is low (20), but pipeline inventory (394) is robust, consisting of orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19. Setting L to the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*mean of last 10 periods to capture the most recent demand level (~104 * 5 = 520). Setting sigma_hat to the standard deviation of the last 10 periods scaled by sqrt(1+L) to maintain a safety buffer against stockouts during the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 392 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in every 'conclude' message from P5 to P20). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but remains relatively stable without a distinct seasonal trend visible in the numeric sequence; the average demand over the last 20 periods is approximately 102 units. Currently, the pipeline (392) consists of orders from P17 (45), P18 (147), P19 (100), and P20 (100). The arrival expected during P21 (ordered P17) is 45 units, which is significantly lower than the average demand of 102, likely leading to a stockout. To recover, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the current mean demand levels, and sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the volatility seen in the last 20 periods. Lead time L is set to 'default', as the promised lead time of 4 is the observed actual lead time. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (4+1) periods (approx 510 units) and order the difference from the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following several periods of stockouts (Periods 18, 20, 21). The lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from Period 1 to 17, with Period 17 arriving at Period 21). Demand has remained relatively stable; recent demand samples (Periods 17-21) are 151, 99, 106, 126, 103, averaging approx 117. Overall historical average is approx 103. Given the profitability ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median (mean) demand over L+1 periods. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (approx 109 over last 10 periods) while using the default lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets approximately (L+1) * mean_demand = 5 * 109 = 545 units total pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with no clear evidence of a regime shift. The mean demand across all observed periods is approximately 102.3 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in multiple 'conclude' messages: P17 arrived P21, P18 arrived P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 units and in-transit is 378 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, the OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using the 'default' method for L (which is the promised 4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat because the long-term averages provide the most stable forecast in the absence of a detected trend or seasonal spike at Period 23. This will set the base stock to approximately 5 * 102.3 = 511.5 units plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 23 periods, with an average demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation around 23. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 90 units and 364 units in-transit (orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23). The shipment from Period 20 is expected to arrive during this period (Period 24). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=23 (covering all post-warmup demand data) to capture the long-term stable mean, and 'default' for lead time since the actual lead time is consistently 4. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=23 to account for historical volatility and ensure a sufficient safety stock without over-ordering, especially as the holding cost equals the profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 20 periods with fluctuations around a mean of approximately 98 units per period. In the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand was 126, 103, 100, 57, and 83 (avg: 93.8), indicating no significant upward or downward trend requiring a regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for Orders 1-20 (Order 5 was skipped/lost initially but arrivals resumed correctly; Order 20 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P24). The inventory position (On-hand: 107 + In-transit: 317 = 424) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~100, we expect to need ~500 units to reach the base stock. The current in-transit includes orders from P21 (126 units), P22 (52 units), P23 (86 units), and P24 (53 units). Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target critical fractile is 0.50, meaning base stock will be close to the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture a stable long-term mean and variance while smoothing out recent noise.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with no significant regime shifts detected over the last 20 periods. The average demand remains approximately 98 units per period (sample mean of the last 20 periods: 98.6). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 90 units on-hand and 275 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25). The OR backend uses (1+L) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, so with L=4, it will cover 5 periods of demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current stable demand mean and variance while smoothing out the noise from the high period-to-period variability (std ~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Calculating the average demand from the most recent 10 periods (Periods 17-26) gives us a mean of approximately 105 units per period. The standard deviation over the same period is approximately 28.5. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 368 units, with on-hand at 59. Our target stock level (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average demand multiplied by (1+L) and keep L at the default promised value. sigma_hat will be set using the standard deviation of those same 10 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, corresponding to an optimal service level where the base stock is simply the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (z=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is at Period 28. Reviewing the lead time history, all arrived orders (Periods 5-8, 10-17, 19-27) consistently show a lead time of 4 periods. The order from Period 5 is missing (likely lost), while the orders from Period 24 (53 units), 25 (84 units), 26 (145 units), and 27 (99 units) are still in-transit. The current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Forecasted demand shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set L to 4. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the very early startup volatility, aiming to maintain a service level that balances the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (q=0.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a period where demand (107) exceeded available supply (77). Analysis of the last 28 periods shows demand centering around 100 units per period (mean of all samples is 100.25). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed (most recently the P24 order arriving in P28). To optimize the OR backend's base-stock calculation, I am using L=4. Given that demand has remained relatively stable without clear regime shifts or strong seasonality, I am using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which leverages the full historical data set to estimate demand and volatility for the (L+1) period horizon. This provides a robust buffer while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed in individual periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and demand in the most recent period (Period 29) surged to 156, well above the historical average. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since Period 5, arrivals have reliably followed the 4-period lead time schedule, though the quantity ordered in Period 5 (missing a conclusion) appears to have arrived as expected. There are no missing shipments currently indicated as the 'In-transit' quantity of 424 units matches the sum of orders from Periods 26 through 29 (145+99+114+66=424). Given the recent demand volatility (Period 29: 156, Period 28: 107, Period 27: 121, Period 25: 143), I will use a shorter window (recent_N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the recent upward trend and increased variance, while sticking to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend in recent periods. Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 26-30) is approximately 123.4, compared to the long-term average of around 103. The last two periods (29 and 30) saw demand spikes to 156 and 150 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline inventory of 395 units covers the expected demand for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Since the recent demand is significantly higher, I am switching to a 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this upward shift while maintaining some stability. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as observed in the history. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level will be 50%. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps balance responsiveness to the recent spike with protection against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~123 over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), with peak demand reaching 156.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand was unexpectedly 0, which is a significant outlier compared to the recent upward trend (P26-P30 mean was ~123). This 0 might be a data glitch or a specific holiday effect, but since I must remain conservative according to the carry-over instructions and prioritize service level (profit and holding cost are equal, giving a 50% service level target), I will adjust the demand forecast to reflect the high volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the regime shift starting at Period 26 while including the most recent '0' data point to prevent over-ordering if the drop is real. For sigma_hat, I'm using N=6 to capture the increased variance caused by the jump from 150 to 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Volatility spike detected in demand. After a regime shift to ~123 (P26-P30), Period 31 demand dropped to 0. Maintaining high sigma_hat to account for this variance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand returned to a more moderate level (71 units) after the zero-demand anomaly in Period 31 and the high-demand regime (avg ~123) in Periods 26-30. The carry-over insight from Period 31 and 32 highlights a significant shift in mean and volatility. To stabilize the forecast, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the shift that began in Period 26, plus the recent volatile readings. This balances the higher baseline with the recent fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (142), and in-transit inventory (339) is significant, so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering if the pipeline is sufficient. I'm keeping sigma_hat high (using recent_N=7) to ensure the service level accounts for the recent high variance (0 to 156 range).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the recent regime (Periods 26-33). While the mean demand increased to approximately 100-110 units, we observed a spike to 156 (P29) followed by a drop to 0 (P31). The most recent demand was 107 (P33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent history (e.g., P29 order arrived at the start of P33). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 101, and in-transit units are high (284). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the current regime from P26 onwards) to capture the higher mean while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation caused by the zero-demand period, ensuring the backend maintains an appropriate safety stock for this level of volatility.

Daily Profit: $42.00, Daily Holding Cost: $175.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-133.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows significant volatility. Following a high-demand regime (P27-P30 avg ~133), demand dropped to 0 in P31 and has been inconsistent since (71, 107, 42). This suggests a possible shift or high variance that the OR engine needs to handle. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P34 arrival of the P30 order. Current on-hand inventory is 175 with 280 units in transit. To account for the recent instability and ensure we don't over-order during a potential downward trend while still protecting against the high peaks seen recently (up to 156), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=9 captures the high-demand period and the subsequent drop, providing a balanced but cautious look at the current regime (Mean demand over last 9 periods is approx 94 units/period). This setting helps the backend calculate a base stock that respects both the potential for high demand and the recent slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: following a peak of 156 (P29), demand fluctuated between 0 and 107 in the last 4 periods (P31-P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of extreme volatility. In Period 35, demand spiked to 256 units, the highest recorded in the history of the simulation, following a low of 42. Recent demand (P31-P35) shows a mean of 95.2 but with a very high standard deviation. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P26-P35) average 108.7 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this higher mean and increased variance compared to the full history. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. On-hand inventory is 76 with 133 in-transit (orders from P32-P35). Given the recent 256 demand spike, the logic must ensure enough stock to cover the L+1 window while the OR backend manages the safety stock based on this high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified at Period 35: observed a record high demand of 256 units, confirming the previous observation of extreme fluctuations (ranging from 0 to 256 in the last 5 periods). Mean demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is 108.7.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility, with a record high of 256 in Period 35 and several stockouts. The last 10 periods (P27-P36) have a mean demand of approximately 112.4, but the variance is very high (std ~68). Period 36 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a lost sales event. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the $1 profit/$1 holding cost (requesting a 50% service level from the base-stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the higher mean and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the extreme spikes (0 to 256 range). Increasing sigma_hat proactively helps prevent stockouts during these unpredictable surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: P35 reached 256 units while P31 was 0. Mean demand over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is ~112 units. Variance is significantly elevated compared to the first 25 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. In the last 10 periods (P28-P37), mean demand is approximately 102.4, but with extreme variance: a zero-demand period (P31), a 256-unit spike (P35), and most recently 115 and 120. The current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 554 in-transit. A notable observation is the missing arrival in Period 36 (order from Period 32 was 0, so that is expected), but the order from Period 33 (11 units) arrived in P37 as expected (L=4). The in-transit pipeline is full (554 units) due to large orders in P31, P34, P36, and P37. Given the extreme 256-unit spike and the subsequent stockouts, I need to maintain a high sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend protects against another spike, even though on-hand is currently zero. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (P26-P37) while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: P35 reached 256 units while P31 was 0. Mean demand over the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is ~110 units with high standard deviation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. In the last 10 periods (P29-P38), the demand has fluctuated wildly between 0 and 256, with a more recent mean (last 5 periods) of approximately 124 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory is low (25 units on-hand) with 442 units in transit. High volatility (standard deviation remains high) necessitates a cautious buffer to handle potential spikes like the 256 units seen in Period 35. I will use the last 13 periods (from P26 onwards) to capture this new regime of higher mean and significantly higher variance. Setting L to 4 based on consistent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with a recent pattern of zero on-hand inventory leading to lost sales. Demand in Period 39 was 129, and the last 10 periods have seen a mean of ~108 with a range from 0 to 256. The stockout Situations in P36, P37, and P39 indicate that the inventory levels are insufficient to meet the current high-volatility demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 510 units (including large orders from P36 and P37 totaling 432 units which are due in P40 and P41), I need to ensure the OR backend adequately covers the volatile demand across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat using recent_14 (the period since the regime shift and volatility spike began around P26) to capture the higher mean and elevated sigma_hat to protect against the frequent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Last 14 periods (P26-P39) show mean demand of ~108.7 but with extreme range (0 to 256), requiring significantly higher safety stock to prevent frequent stockouts observed in P36-P39.

The most recent period (P40) saw a demand of 124, aligning with the elevated mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (P36 order arrived in P40). Pipeline inventory is at 327 units, with on-hand at 101. To manage the extreme variance and prevent stockouts like those seen in P36-P39, I will use a larger sample window (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of the recent volatility regime while stabilizing the base stock calculation.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 108 units but a range spanning 0 to 256. At Period 42, we are in a relatively good inventory position with 220 units on-hand and 248 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, and P41). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk observed in Period 36-39 when inventory dipped, and the current high volatility, I will use recent_N (N=16, covering the volatile regime from P26-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures both the recent mean demand level and the significantly increased standard deviation to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient safety stock without over-ordering excessively as we approach the game's final periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to show extreme volatility, with a regime starting around Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 110.8 units per period, but the standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the first 25 periods (ranging from 0 to 256). To handle this, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=17 (covering P26 to P42) to capture the higher mean of this current regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=17 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed spike in variance, which is necessary to maintain service levels despite the frequent stockouts seen between Periods 36-39. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 41 conclude', so L is kept at 'default'. Current inventory status (OH: 124, IT: 329) is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time and demand volatility, the parameters must ensure the pipeline is sufficient for a 5-period horizon demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P26 confirmed: Mean ~111, but volatility remains extreme (0-256 range). Sigma_hat needs to reflect this high variance to protect against stockouts during spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean (~111) since Period 26, but continues to exhibit significant volatility (range 0 to 256). Period 43 demand was 95, reinforcing the current regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 107 and in-transit at 343 (total pipeline 450), the system needs to maintain a high safety stock to prevent stockouts during the extreme demand spikes seen recently (e.g., P35's 256). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the regime from P26 to P43) to capture the increased mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same window to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance in its base stock calculation. Profits and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a service level target of 0.5, but the capped policy and high sigma will help buffer against the detected volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the regime shift detected around Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units, but with an extreme range (0 to 256) and significant variance. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (Periods 43 and 44). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units, and in-transit inventory is 392 units. To prevent the stockouts observed in Periods 36-39 while managing the high volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the last 19 periods (starting from the Period 26 shift) to capture the current mean more accurately. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the historical standard deviation of this high-volatility regime to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against demand spikes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, which has been the primary challenge since Period 26. In the most recent periods (P41-P45), demand was 88, 96, 95, 104, and 69, resulting in a mean of 90.4. However, looking back further to P35, we saw a massive spike of 256. The current lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 104 and in-transit at 367, we are currently well-stocked, but must account for the high variance to avoid stockouts during future spikes. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the higher mean and extreme variance shift that began around P26, as this provides a safer estimate than the very recent lower demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=20 to ensure the backend captures the extreme volatility observed in the 0 to 256 range. This balanced approach protects against spikes while acknowledging the current period's moderate demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100-110 units following the extreme volatility observed between Periods 26-40. In the most recent 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 98.2 units, though individual periods still range from 69 to 129. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 111 and in-transit at 345, the total pipeline is 456 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A mean demand forecast of ~105 per period suggests a requirement of 525 units. The current pipeline (456) is slightly below this, especially when considering the need for safety stock to handle spikes (like the 129 in P39). I will use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the still-elevated variance relative to the early game, while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized around 100 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46 mean: 98.2), but volatility remains higher than P1-P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the inventory position for chips(Regular) consists of 107 units on-hand and 288 units in-transit. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 37, the demand mean has stabilized around 100 units (mean of P37-P47 is approximately 98.4), reflecting a shift away from the extreme volatility seen around Period 35 (where demand hit 256). However, the standard deviation since Period 26 is still significantly higher than the initial baseline. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the stable period P37-P47) to capture the current mean of ~98. To account for the remaining volatility risks and prevent stockouts during the final periods of the simulation, I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=22 (covering the period from the start of the high-volatility regime at P26 to the present) to ensure the OR backend maintains an adequate' safety stock. This approach balances the current lower mean demand with the historically observed volatility of this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-70.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units over the last 10 periods (P38-P47 mean: 94.2, P48: 64), confirming the lower mean reported in the recent carry-over insight. However, extreme spikes (e.g., P35: 256) still exist in the historical window, requiring a robust sigma_hat to maintain high service levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P44 order arrived at P48). Currently, on-hand (134) plus in-transit (292) equals 426 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At a mean of ~100, we need approx 500 units in the pipeline to be safe against the observed volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime since Period 37, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with a larger N=20 to ensure the backend accounts for the extreme spikes seen in the P30s. This balances current demand levels with protection against historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods (P35-P49) around a mean of 105.1 units, albeit with significant historic volatility (min 0, max 256). Recent performance (P40-P49) shows a tighter mean of 92.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 121 units, and there are 239 units in transit, totaling 360 units of pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the post-volatility stabilization period while weighting recent volume appropriately. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed spikes (like the 256 units in P35) in its safety stock calculation, preventing stockouts during future unpredictable surges. This configuration aims to balance the high holding cost with a necessary service level against potential return-to-volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized around 105 units over the last 15 periods (P35-P49: mean 105.1) following extreme volatility.
