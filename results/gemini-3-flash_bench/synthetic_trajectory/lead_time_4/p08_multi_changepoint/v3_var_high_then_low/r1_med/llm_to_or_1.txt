Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no arrivals yet and only 5 initial demand samples (mean = 92.8, std \u2248 21.01), I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the backend to utilize the promised lead time (4) and the full initial sample set. Given L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. The expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 464, which will inform the initial base stock calculation. No lead time shifts or demand regime changes are yet detectable.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 132 units and faced a demand of 110 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, those units have not arrived yet, and we recorded 0 sales due to 0 starting inventory. The inventory view shows 132 units in-transit. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the mean of observed demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82, and the recent actual demand of 110) to set the parameters. The total samples available including the history is 6 samples. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the established demand baseline. The OR backend will compute the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 (132 units each, totaling 264 in-transit) are expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, according to the lead time definition (N+L). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have already missed demand in Periods 1 and 2 (total 255 units lost), we need to ensure our base stock covers the demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). The historical demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) have a mean of 96.8. However, actual demand in Period 1 (110) and Period 2 (145) shows a slight upward trend compared to the initial samples. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the recent higher demand (N=5 using the last 3 historical samples + 2 game periods). This sets mu_hat to (1+4) * mean(95, 116, 82, 110, 145) = 5 * 109.6 = 548.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 413 units in-transit (132 from P1, 132 from P2, 149 from P3). Historical demand for Period 1-3 shows values of 110, 145, and 113 (averaging ~123). Combined with provided sample data (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the demand seems relatively stable but higher than initial expectations. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the default promised lead time and applying recent demand history (N=5 using provided samples + history) to capture the trend. mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean. Mean of recent 5 (P1-P3 history + P4-P5 samples) is (110+145+113+116+82)/5 = 113.2. mu_hat = 5 * 113.2 = 566.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 are currently in-transit (Total 564 units). Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Demand history shows samples of 71, 120, 95, 116, and 82 (from the prompt data), while the 'Game History' section reports realized demand of 110, 145, 113, and 88 for Periods 1-4. The mean demand for Periods 1-4 is approximately 114 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet. I will maintain the default lead time of 4 and use the average demand of all samples to set the base stock level to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (from Period 1) with an actual lead time of 4, confirming consistency with the promised lead time. Current On-hand is 97 and In-transit is 433 (representing orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Historical demand data provided in the prompt (P1: 71, P2: 120, P3: 95, P4: 116, P5: 82) differs from the 'conclude' message logs which show significantly higher demand (P1: 110, P2: 145, P3: 113, P4: 88, P5: 35). I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it reflects the actual environment dynamics. The mean demand of the last 5 periods from the logs is 98.2. Since L=4, the review+lead period covers 1+4=5 periods. Expected demand over this window is 5 * 98.2 = 491. Standard deviation of the log demand is ~40.9, so sigma_hat over the window is sqrt(5) * 40.9 = 91.5. Pipeline inventory (433) + On-hand (97) = 530, which is already slightly above the base stock requirement (491 + safety stock). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime observed in the game history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Average demand from game history logs is approximately 98 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have confirmed that the lead time L is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). The system now has a stable on-hand inventory of 123 units and a pipeline of 339 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Historical demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) plus game history demand (110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106) suggest a mean demand of approximately 98 units per period. The low demand in Period 5 (35) appears to be an outlier. To calculate mu_hat, I use the formula (1 + L) * average_demand. With L=4, (1+4) * 98 = 490. For volatility, the standard deviation of the provided samples (~20) suggests a sigma_hat of sqrt(1+4) * 20 \u2248 45. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate the observed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters covering the most relevant recent 6 periods of game history to stay responsive to current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (Periods 1-7) averages 95.57 units. Observations from Periods 5-7 confirm the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods (promised = actual). Starting with Period 5, arrivals have matched the orders from Periods 1-3. Current on-hand inventory is 200 units, with 295 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7). Pipeline total is 495 units. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using all 7 observed demand samples, the mean is ~95.6 and the standard deviation is ~34.8. For mu_hat, the backend 'default' will compute (1+L)*mean_of_all, which is (5 * 95.57) = 477.85. Since our total pipeline (495) already exceeds the required base stock calculated from current data, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in a near-zero order, which is appropriate given we have sufficient stock arriving to cover the lead time without accumulating excessive holding costs.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (promised lead time) based on arrivals from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) and the game history logs (Periods 1-8: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112) show some variance but no clear structural shift or regime change yet. The average demand across all available data is approximately 98.4 units per period. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full game history available for demand resolution) is appropriate here to capture the current mean and standard deviation for the OR backend to calculate the base stock level. Currently, on-hand is 239 and in-transit is 184 (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8), totalling 423 units. With an average demand of ~98, this pipeline inventory is sufficient for roughly 4.3 periods, suggesting the OR backend will place a moderate replenishment order to maintain the service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9, all confirming an actual lead time of 4. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean of the available period samples (P1-P9) is approximately 98.2 units, with a standard deviation around 29.5. The recent demand (P5-P9) averages 85.2 units, but there is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, so I will continue to use the full sample history. Pipeline inventory is currently 311 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9), and on-hand inventory is 139. With L=4, the OR backend logic targets a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using 'calculate' for L and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat ensures the backend uses all historical data to balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (Period 1-10 mean: 100.3). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10. We are currently at Period 11. The order from Period 7 (105 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 11) and become visible at the start of Period 12. On-hand inventory is 56, and in-transit inventory is 362 (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the demand regime appears stable, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history of demand. The L value is confirmed at 4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 11, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand (mu) for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without significant regime shifts or seasonal patterns apparent in the data provided. The average demand across all 11 periods is approximately 97 units per period. In Period 11, we observed a slightly lower demand of 67, but this is within the normal range of variation. Our current inventory position (On-hand: 94 + In-transit: 397) covers approximately 5 periods of average demand, which is appropriate given L=4 (total exposure is L+1 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent history of stable demand, ensuring the OR backend targets approximately (1+4)*97=485 units for the base stock level. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect observed volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 27 units. Based on historical data from periods 1-12, the average demand is 98.9 units per period, with a standard deviation of 30.7 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 410 units includes orders from Periods 9 (128 units), 10 (89 units), 11 (140 units), and 12 (53 units), which are expected to arrive in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 respectively. Since the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met, I will continue using L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the demand has been relatively stable, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture all available game history samples for the most accurate baseline. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the observed volatility. The parameters target a coverage of (L+1) = 5 periods to account for the demand occurring between the decision and arrival.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Period 1 through Period 9 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but remains within a relatively stable range. Over the last 8 periods (Period 6 to Period 13), the average demand is approximately 102 units per period (106, 72, 112, 101, 121, 67, 107, 130). Including the initial game history samples (avg ~96), the overall mean is around 100. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (25 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (390 units), which includes orders from Period 10 (89 units due now in P14), Period 11 (140 units), Period 12 (53 units), and Period 13 (108 units). This in-transit pipeline (390) plus on-hand (25) covers about 4.15 periods of demand (at 100/period), which is close to the (L+1)=5 period coverage needed. I will use a recent window (N=8) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the slightly higher recent volume while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (P1-P10 arrivals all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 100 units per period. The recent demand (P10-P14) exhibits some volatility, but no clear regime shift is evident. I will continue using the promised lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history, as P1-P4 demand was slightly higher. This results in mu_hat targeting a (1+L)=5 period window of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 438 units already in transit while aiming to replenish inventory for the upcoming 5-period risk horizon.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand across all 15 periods is 98.6 units, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods (Periods 11-15) is 96 units, indicating stability with no significant regime shifts. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there are 71 units on-hand and 361 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). This pipeline (432 total units) covers approximately 4.4 periods of average demand, which is appropriate for a Lead Time (L) of 4. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) provides a balance between long-term stability and recent variation, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers demand across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed across all 12 completed delivery cycles (P1-P12). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts in the recent data. The mean demand across the 16 recorded periods is approximately 96.1 units. Calculated standard deviation is 27.6. Since the lead time (L) is 4, the target window is L+1 = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=16 ensures the OR backend captures the full breadth of the current stable demand regime. The parameters L=default (4), mu_hat (recent_N=16), and sigma_hat (recent_N=16) will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers ~480 units (5 * 96) plus a safety stock buffer based on the observed volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 96 units/period over the last 17 periods (global mean 96.5, recent periods hovering around 90-100). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals from Period 5 through 17. Currently, the pipeline inventory is 359 units (orders from P14-P17) and on-hand is 86 units. Total system inventory (445) effectively covers about 4.6 periods of demand. Since the lead time is 4, we need coverage for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability while ignoring the initial high-variance start. This balances the service level for a high-profit item (Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1) while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time as it has proven reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable; average demand over last 10 periods is 97.5 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. Demand shows a high degree of stability; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 101.5 units, which is consistent with the long-term average. The most recent demand (P18) was slightly higher at 157 units, but there is no evidence yet of a sustained regime shift or seasonal spike. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units with 305 units in-transit (orders from P15-P18). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current stable regime while allowing for recent variability. This will set a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (as profit=$4 and holding=$1, q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we experienced a stockout (150 demand vs 129 starting inventory). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals (P1-P15 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are 393 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19). The next arrival in Period 20 (ordered P16) is expected to be 106 units. Demand appears slightly more volatile recently (157 and 150 in P18/P19), though the long-term average remains near 97-100. Given the current stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while accounting for the recent spikes, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 19 (demand 150 outstripped supply). Demand variance has increased in the last two periods (P18-19), averaging 153.5 compared to the historical ~98.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current context shows a transition from a sudden high-demand volatility (P18-19 averaged ~153 units) to a very low-demand outlier in Period 20 (20 units). The stockout in Period 19 was caused by this surge, but it was immediately followed by a demand crash. Based on the history, the 'regular' demand regime typically averages ~98 units, but the high variance in the last 3 periods (157, 150, 20) suggests we should use a recent window (N=3) to capture the increased volatility (sigma_hat) while being cautious with the mean (mu_hat). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have a high 'In-transit' quantity (442 units) and 86 on-hand, we need to balance the risk of another stockout against the high holding costs of over-ordering. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat provides a local mean of ~109 units (slightly higher than historical to protect against another surge), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat provides the necessary safety stock for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in P18-19 (~150/period) followed by a sharp drop in P20 (20/period), suggesting a high-variance environment despite a stable long-term mean of ~98.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a period of extreme demand volatility. The long-term average (P1-P21) is approximately 104 units, but recent periods have fluctuated between 20 (P20) and 190 (P21). Period 21 resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0) because demand (190) significantly exceeded available supply (139). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high variance and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean of the current volatile regime (avg ~129 over P18-21) and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased standard deviation (~65 units per period), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher safety stock level to prevent further stockouts while lead time remains at 4 (coverage for 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Sustained shift in demand volatility observed starting P18: Period-over-period demand is swinging between 20 and 190, requiring higher safety stock despite a relatively stable long-term mean.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a period of high volatility and frequent stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0 for Period 23 following two consecutive stockout cycles (P21, P22). Historical tracking shows the promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate (P18 order arrived in P22). Since P18, demand has fluctuated wildly (157, 150, 20, 190, 109), significantly departing from the initial mean of ~98. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods is 125.2. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the high-volatility regime starting at P18) to provide the Backend with a more responsive estimate of current demand pressure. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this heightened risk of spikes (e.g., P21's demand of 190), which ensures the calculated safety stock is sufficient to prevent further stockouts. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern shows high volatility following Period 18, with significant stockouts in P19, P21, and P22. Demand has fluctuated between 20 and 190 units, though the average over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is approximately 119, which is higher than the long-term historical mean of ~98. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P23 conclusion. To prevent further stockouts given this increased volatility and slightly higher recent mean, I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-variance regime. Setting L to default (which is the promised 4) reflects the consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P18-P23); recent 6-period mean demand has increased to ~119 with a significantly higher standard deviation compared to the P1-P17 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 18, transitioning from a stable mean of ~98 to a high-variance pattern with periodic large spikes (e.g., 157, 150, 190). Over the last 7 periods (P18-P24), the average demand has risen to approximately 119.1 units per period, with a significantly higher standard deviation. We are currently recovering from multiple stockouts (P19, P21, P22) caused by this volatility. The lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. To reflect the recent increase in both the mean and the volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the higher average demand and provides enough safety stock to handle the observed spikes, effectively balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant increase in volatility starting around Period 18. While the long-term average remains near 100 units/period, recent demand has fluctuated wildly between 10 and 190 units (e.g., P21: 190, P25: 10). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 251 and in-transit at 439, we are well-stocked against the current mean, but the high variance requires a robust safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P19, P21, and P22. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher mean observed during this volatile regime (avg ~100-110) while ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the increased standard deviation (sigma_hat) by using the same recent window of 8 periods (P18-P25).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since Period 18: demand range [10, 190]. Recent 8-period mean is 98.3, but standard deviation has nearly tripled compared to P1-P17.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P18-P26) exhibits extreme volatility with values ranging from 10 to 190. While the mean remains relatively stable around 100, the standard deviation has significantly increased since Period 18 compared to the first 17 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this high-variance regime starting at Period 18. This ensures the OR backend calculates a sufficient safety stock to handle the observed spikes (like the 190 demand in P21) while balancing the high holding cost of the current excess inventory (413 units on hand). The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 18. While the long-term mean remains around 100 units/period, recent demand has fluctuated wildly between 10 and 190. For Period 28, we observe an on-hand inventory of 393 and in-transit inventory of 158 (representing orders from P24 and P25). The arrival of 64 units in P27 (ordered P23) confirms the lead time remains steady at 4 periods. Given the high standard deviation in the recent regime (P18-P27), the base stock calculation must account for higher safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P19, P21, and P22. We use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this high-variance regime. Although on-hand inventory is currently high due to earlier aggressive ordering, 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' need to reflect the current risk profile to sustain the service level as stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime confirmed since Period 18: demand range [10, 190], standard deviation significantly elevated compared to P1-P17. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment remains in a high-volatility regime that started at Period 18. Recent demand exhibits significant swings (ranging from 10 to 190), although the average since the volatility began (P18-P28) is approximately 97.4, which is very close to the historical long-term mean of ~98. However, the standard deviation is drastically higher in this period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 381 and in-transit is 163 (orders from P25, P28). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high variance, a robust safety stock is needed to avoid stockouts like those seen in P19, P21, and P22, while also managing holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the stable mean of 98 per period (extrapolated for L+1 = 5 periods) and use an explicit sigma_hat that captures the recently observed high volatility (Standard Deviation of P18-P28 is ~55, so for (L+1) periods, sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5) * 55 \u2248 123).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 18. While the long-term mean remains near 100, the standard deviation has significantly increased, with demand ranging from 10 to 190. Current on-hand inventory is high (469 units) due to recent low demand (23 and 59 units) and arrivals from high-order periods (P21-P25). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the upcoming pipeline, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this high-variance regime (covering P18-P29). This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for the increased volatility while the high inventory naturally restricts new orders through the capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-194.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (range of 10-190) since Period 18, though the recent central tendency has moderated. Over the last 13 periods (P18-P30), average demand is approximately 89 units per period, but with significant swings. On-hand inventory is currently high (414 units) due to aggressive ordering during the volatility surge and stockout events between Periods 19-22. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the system targets a pipeline that covers 5 periods of demand ((L+1)*mean). Given current on-hand (414) plus in-transit (86) equals 500 units, and the expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 445-500 units, the inventory position is adequate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the mean of the high-volatility regime while using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the tripled variance observed recently. This will allow the OR engine to maintain a high service level while managing the current inventory surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 18, with values ranging from 10 to 190. While the long-term mean remains around 100, the last 4 periods have shown lower demand (23, 55, 138), but we must remain prepared for the volatility. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current inventory on-hand is 276, and there is 124 in-transit (Period 28 order of 52, Period 29 order of 34, Period 31 order of 38). Note that Period 26, 27, and 30 had orders of 0, which successfully helped reduce the overstock situation seen around Period 25-29. I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture the increased variance of the high-volatility regime (starting P18) while maintaining the baseline mean. This N=14 covers the entire volatile period to ensure sigma_hat reflect the risks of a stockout without over-ordering during low-demand troughs.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P18-P31) persists: mean reflects stable long-term demand (~100) but standard deviation is approximately 53, significantly higher than P1-P17 (~25).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 18, with values ranging from 10 to 190. While the long-term mean remains centered around 100 units/period, the standard deviation has significantly increased (observed ~53 in recent periods vs. ~25 initially). The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (279) plus in-transit (227) is 506 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A mean of 100 * 5 = 500 units is the base expectation, but high volatility requires a high safety stock. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime since P18, and use default for L as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-178.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 18. While the long-term mean is approximately 98-100 units, the demand swings significantly (ranging from 10 to 190). Recent periods continue to show this pattern, with Period 31 seeing a spike to 138 and Period 33 dropping to 27. The current on-hand inventory (286) plus in-transit (227) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of average demand, which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals in P32 and P33). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the high-volatility regime starting at Period 18, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=16 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased standard deviation in its safety stock calculation. The 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as lead times are currently predictable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-141.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 18 has been characterized by extreme volatility (range 10-190) while maintaining a long-term mean near 100 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P28 and P29. Analyzing recent history, the mean demand of the last 15 periods (since P20) is approximately 75 units, but the high-variance context (std ~53) necessitates a robust safety stock. Currently, there is sufficient on-hand inventory (257) and in-transit (235) to cover immediate demand. I use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level while accounting for the high volatility environment with an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to ensure a high service level, preventing stockouts similar to those in P19 and P21. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4), which is consistent with historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $525.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 18. While the long-term mean is stable at approximately 98.6 units/period, the standard deviation is significantly elevated (around 52 units since the shift). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 131 + in-transit 197 = 328) must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the high volatility (recent peak of 164 in P35 and periodic spikes above 150), I am using 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the entire high-volatility regime) to capture the increased variance (sigma_hat) and the representative mean (mu_hat) for this period. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during demand surges without causing excessive holding costs during the frequent low-demand troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in the recent period (P35 demand=164, P36 demand=111). Since Period 18, the demand distribution has changed from a low-variance state to one with extreme swings (ranging from 10 to 190), though the long-term mean remains near 100 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, with the P32 order arriving exactly in P36. Currently, on-hand inventory is 175 and in-transit is 221. To manage the high volatility while accounting for the lead time (L=4), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the period since the volatility shift at Period 18). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current variance without over-reacting to single-period outliers, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 18. While the long-term mean remains around 100 units/period, the standard deviation has significantly increased, with recent demand ranging from 10 to 190. In Period 37, demand was 110. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 99 units on-hand and 327 in-transit (Total pipeline: 426), we need to maintain a safety stock that accounts for this high variance to prevent stockouts like those seen in P19 and P21. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=20 to capture the start of the high-volatility regime (P18-P37), ensuring the OR backend balances the service level against the $1 holding cost given the $4 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are in a high-volatility demand regime that began around Period 18. While the average demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~100 since Period 1), the standard deviation has significantly increased (sigma ~53). Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), although there is a substantial pipeline of 433 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high variance and the stockout risk observed in similar low-inventory periods (e.g., P19, P21), I am maintaining a responsive mu_hat using recent_N=21 (the length of the high-volatility regime from P18-P38) and an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer. This approach balances the high holding cost ($1.0) against the high profit ($4.0) by targeting a 0.8 service level while accounting for the recent extreme demand swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero following a stockout in Period 39 (demand 120 vs. 6 on-hand). The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 481 units. Based on historical lead times (confirmed as 4 periods), we expect arrivals to resume in Period 40 (from the Period 35 order) and Period 41 (from the Period 36 order, which was a large order of 179 units). Demand continues to follow the high-volatility regime identified around Period 18, with significant swings between 20 and 190. The mean demand remains relatively stable around 100 units/period, but the standard deviation is drastically elevated compared to the start of the game. To maximize reward while managing the $1.0 holding cost against $4.0 profit (targeting a critical ratio for high service level), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 to encompass the entire high-volatility regime (P18-P39). This ensures the OR backend captures the higher variance needed for safety stock during this volatile phase. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime since Period 18. Recent demand (P35-P40) has averaged approximately 120.8 units per period (164, 111, 110, 101, 120, 119), which is higher than the long-term historical mean of ~100. The standard deviation also remains significantly elevated compared to the early periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. In-transit inventory is 368 units (orders from P37: 140, P38: 114, P39: 48, P40: 66). Inventory on hand is currently 60. Combined inventory (428) covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the recent average of ~120 units. To maintain safety stock against high volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in P19, P21, P22, and P39, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6 periods of higher demand and sigma_hat using the recent 23 periods (since the volatility regime started in P18) to provide the OR backend with a robust estimate of the current variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Recent 6-period demand mean (P35-P40) has shifted upwards to ~121 units/period from the long-term mean of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P35-P41) has averaged ~118 units, confirming the upward shift noted in previous insights (P41 carry-over). The high volatility regime that began in P18 continues, with significant demand fluctuations. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41 exactly 4 periods later). Since the demand mean has stabilized at a higher level (~118) for the last 7 periods, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand. For sigma_hat, I will use the last 24 periods (since the volatility shift in P18) to ensure the OR engine maintains enough safety stock to handle the extreme swings observed in this regime. Current on-hand is 99 with 434 in-transit (P38-P41 orders), which aligns with the 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher-mean, high-volatility demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: mean increased to ~118 units/period (P35-P41) from previous ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift initiated around Period 35 is now well-established. Over the last 8 periods (P35-P42), average demand is approximately 117.25 units, significantly higher than the previous long-term mean of ~100. Furthermore, demand volatility remains high (\u03c3 \u2248 45 over recent periods), necessitating a robust safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 101 units and a high in-transit pipeline (472 units), the total inventory position is 573. Given a target base stock based on \u03bc=118 and L=4 (total exposure 5 periods), the expected requirement is roughly 590-650 units depending on the service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-mean, high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR engine accounts for the total demand lead time (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 remains sustained: 8-period mean (P35-P42) is 117.25 units/period (up ~17% from baseline) with continued high volatility (StdDev ~18-45 range).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 35, and this higher mean has been sustained. For Period 44, I am analyzing the demand from the last 9 periods (P35-P43), where the mean is approximately 112.2 units per period (samples: 164, 111, 110, 101, 120, 119, 101, 112, 72). The standard deviation in this recent window remains relatively high (approx 23.5) compared to early game stability, though lower than the peak volatility period (P18-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 77, and the pipeline is significant (476 units), reflecting orders placed during the high-demand detection phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current mean of ~112 units/period, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture current volatility. These parameters ensure the backend targets a base stock level covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current high-service-level requirement (profit $4 vs cost $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: 9-period mean (P35-P43) is 112.2 units/period (historically ~100). Standard deviation has stabilized to approx 23.5.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 35, moving from a long-term mean of ~100 to approximately 112 units per period. The most recent 10 periods (P35-P44) show an average demand of 111.9, confirming this shift. Volatility has stabilized recently compared to the extreme swings seen in Periods 18-34, with a 10-period standard deviation of approximately 27 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P40's order in P44. I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained higher demand level and current volatility while filtering out the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 17% increase in mean demand observed over the last 10 periods.

Analyzing the last 11 periods (P35-P45), the mean demand is approximately 107.2, down from the peak seen in the P35-P42 window but still higher than the historical baseline of ~100. Volatility remains present but has moderated compared to the extreme swings seen between Periods 18-34. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P41 order arrived P45). With 164 on-hand and 357 in-transit (Total 521), we are covering about 4.8 periods of demand at the current rate (~108). To maintain the optimal base stock (L+1 = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this 'moderate-high' demand phase accurately, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the current risk profile. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents stockouts leading into the final game periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 has stabilized: 11-period mean (P35-P45) is 107.2 units/period with standard deviation around 26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 35, showing a higher mean (~107 units/period) compared to the initial baseline (~100). Recent demand in Periods 45 and 46 has moderated (80 units each), suggesting the 'high volatility' phase since Period 18 might be settling into a more stable state, though still slightly elevated. The 12-period mean from P35-P46 is 104.9. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-shift average. Lead time (L) remains consistently 4 periods (P42 order arrived P46). Pipeline inventory (272) plus on-hand (236) total 508 units, which is ample for the remaining 4 periods of the game (P47-P50). Given the high on-hand inventory, my parameters will result in smaller or zero orders to minimize holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation while maintaining a buffer for the remaining demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized with a mean around 107-112 units. Specifically, looking at the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the mean demand is approx 101.9 units, and the last 5 periods (P43-P47) align at 87 units. While the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~107-112, the most recent activity suggests the demand has moderated slightly from the peak seen in P35-P42. The lead time remains steady at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders placed 4 periods prior (e.g., P43 order arrived in P47). With On-hand inventory at 189 and In-transit at 289, the pipeline is well-stocked for the promised 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift stabilization period (starting around P38), which balances the recent moderation with the elevated mean from the P35 shift. This allows the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the observed stabilized volatility while maintaining a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the demand environment for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilization of the regime shift that began around Period 35. The mean demand from P35 to P48 is approximately 99 units, which is close to the long-term historical mean. However, recent periods (P43-P48) show a slightly lower average demand of 86.8 units with reduced volatility (StdDev ~11), contrasting with the higher volatility seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is 158 units, with 283 units in transit (specifically from P45, P46, P47, and P48). Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the P35-P48 regime) to maintain a robust forecast that acknowledges both the recent lower demand and the previous spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=14 to capture the consolidated volatility of this most recent era. L is set to 'default' as the 4-period lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P35-P48 has stabilized with a mean of ~99 units/period, but very recent demand (P43-P48) has softened to ~87 units/period with lower volatility.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the demand environment for 'chips(Regular)' shows a return to stability after a period of higher volatility and mean shifts. The mean demand over the most recent 15 periods (P35-P49) is approximately 104 units, but more importantly, the last 7 periods (P43-P49) have shown a very stable mean of approximately 89 units with a low standard deviation of roughly 12. This suggests the volatile period (starting at P18) and the high-mean period (starting at P35) have transitioned into a lower-demand, low-volatility state. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 156 units on-hand and 308 in-transit (Total pipeline: 464), and an expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) of roughly 445-500 units based on recent averages, the current inventory position is well-balanced. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized regime since the last major shift at P35, and 'recent_N' with N=15 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced but still present volatility compared to early game samples. Lead time remains 'default' at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at Period 49: the mean for P43-P49 is approximately 89 units/period with significantly reduced standard deviation (~12) compared to the P35-P42 period.
