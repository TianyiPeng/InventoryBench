Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. There is no historical data yet to confirm actual lead times or demand shifts beyond the provided samples (Periods 1-5). These samples show demand: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82. The mean of these 5 samples is 96.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. Since it is the first period, I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and use the sample mean to inform the mu_hat calculation. For mu_hat, the backend 'default' uses the mean of all samples; I will use n=5 as my base. At the start, the priority is to build inventory to cover the (L+1) = 5 period lead time window.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 132 units. According to the lead time definition, with a promised lead time (L) of 4, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. We will see confirmation of this in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 132 units in-transit. In Period 1, demand was 120 units, but because the order hadn't arrived yet (on-hand 0), we had 0 sales and a stockout. The backend OR logic uses (1+L) periods of demand for the base stock. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. The historical samples (P1-P5 from user prompt) show a mean of 96.8 units per period. I will use the 'default' methods for now to establish a baseline using all available historical data (P1-P5) while the in-transit order moves through the pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively (P_n + 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as reflected in the history (sold=0 despite demand). Total in-transit is 268 (132 from P1 + 136 from P2). Historical demand samples are [71, 120, 95, 116, 82]. Applying calendar awareness is limited as the dates are generic 'Period_X'. Mean demand across 5 samples is 96.8. With L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. mu_hat should target 5 * 96.8 = 484. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of samples (approx 20.3) scaled by sqrt(5), giving ~45.4. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available samples (N=5) to capture the current average and volatility accurately.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (N+L) and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the zero arrivals in Periods 1-3 are expected and follow the lead time definition. Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 21.0. The demand in the conclude messages slightly differs from the seed data but remains within the same distribution. Since we have no completed lead-time cycles yet, I will use 'default' methods based on promised lead time and all historical demand samples to establish the base stock. The OR engine will target a service level 'q' of 19/(19+1) = 0.95. mu_hat will represent demand over (1+L) = 5 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period (1+4)=5. However, we only see the confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which we will read at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 526 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4: 132+136+128+130=526). All demand so far has been lost because arrivals haven't started. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods is: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (note: historical demand provided in prompt differs slightly from game history conclude messages; I will prioritize the game history for recent behavior: 120, 90, 102, 72). The average demand is approximately 96 units per period. Since L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline as arrivals begin.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Looking at history, the first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since Lead Time = 4, the order cycle covers 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand samples are 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (pre-game) and 120, 90, 102, 72, 117 (observed Periods 1-5). Calculating the mean for all 10 samples gives approximately 98.5. The standard deviation is approximately 18.5. Current on-hand inventory is 15, with 403 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Note that because we only received our first shipment in Period 5, sales were 0 for the first four periods due to stockouts. Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available data points for a stable forecast, as no significant demand regime shift or lead time deviation is yet confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1089.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met exactly (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand for chips(Regular) has been somewhat volatile over the first 6 periods: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62. The average demand across all 6 periods is 93.8, with a standard deviation of 22.8. Current inventory status: 89 on-hand and 398 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat using the 'default' method (mean of all samples) which the backend will multiply by (1+L), and the same for sigma_hat. This ensures we maintain a cycle service level consistent with the product's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2243.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly after 4 periods. Therefore, we will continue using the default lead time (L=4). Regarding demand, the mean over the first 7 periods is approximately 98 units (sum: 686 / 7). However, there is significant variance, with demand ranging from 62 to 123. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been 117, 62, and 123, showing no clear regime shift but rather high volatility. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full range of observed outcomes while calculating the base stock for (1+L)=5 periods of demand. This allows the OR backend to set a safety stock that accounts for the observed standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2216.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analysis of historical data (Period 1 to 8) shows demand is relatively stable with a mean of 101.125 and a standard deviation of 22.84. However, after the initial supply gap due to the 4-period lead time, we have now achieved a stable flow of inventory. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 arriving exactly 4 periods later in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The promised lead time of 4 is accurate. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally target a high service level. Since demand does not show a clear trend or regime shift yet, using all available samples (N=8) is appropriate for calculating the forecast parameters for the upcoming lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2069.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with no significant seasonal or regime shifts detected across the 9 observed periods. The mean demand is approximately 101.3 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Periods 1 through 5, all confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 475 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Given the Lead Time (L) of 4, our look-ahead window is L+1 = 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (all available post-start samples) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current steady-state demand volatility and mean. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon while accounting for the significant in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical analysis shows that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders in P1 through P6). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 102.9 units (Total: 1029 / 10). Demand appears stable without clear seasonal shifts yet. Current inventory status: On-hand (22) + In-transit (460) = 482 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 482 units covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full history of recorded demand (Periods 1-10) to parameterize the OR engine, while maintaining the lead time at the confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 11 (sold 90 units against a demand of 96). The game history confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P7). This means an order placed now in P12 will arrive in P16, requiring us to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (P12 to P16). Historical demand samples (P1-P11) range from 62 to 123, with a mean of ~100.4. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~112.2, while the initial 5 samples provided in the prompt averaged ~96.8. Given the slight upward trend or at least higher volatility recently, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to ensure we recover from the current stockout and maintain service levels. The target service level (q) is high (19 / (19+1) = 0.95), so the OR backend will set a base stock that covers approximately 95% of demand variation over the 5-period window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 32 units, with 467 units in transit. Historical demand over the 12 concluded periods shows a range of 62 to 123, with a mean of approximately 100.67 and a standard deviation of 19.3. There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonal pattern based on the generic 'Period_X' dates. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by deliveries in periods 5 through 12). Since there is no significant trend or shift, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture recent minor fluctuations, setting N=12 to cover all available historical data. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=12 to maintain stability. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period reality, which matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1447.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Based on the game history, the actual lead time L has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 9 arriving exactly 4 periods later). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-13) are: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122, 109, 111, 96, 103, 81. The mean demand is approximately 100.6 units per period, and the standard deviation is approximately 18.5. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes visible in the first 13 periods; demand remains relatively stable around 100 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed values are consistent with the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (using all 13 samples) since no specific demand regime shift has been detected to justify a 'recent_N' window. This provides a stable base stock calculation for the OR backend to balance the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 14. Current on-hand inventory is 88 units. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without clear seasonal trends in the provided period markers. Historical demand across the first 14 periods has a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of 18 units. Period 11 saw a stockout, suggesting the inventory levels were slightly too lean for the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variance while smoothing out artifacts like the Period 4 dip. I select N=10 to encompass the stable regime observed since the system normalized after the initial lead-time gap. Setting lead time to 'calculate' lets the backend leverage the confirmed 4-period history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all orders since Period 5 (P11 arrived P15). Demand has been relatively stable; calculating the average of all 15 completed periods gives approximately 101.3 units, while the recent 5-period average (P11-P15) is 100.4 units. Since there is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonality, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the stable demand mean and variance while discarding the very early noisy samples. The in-transit inventory is 388 units (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), and current on-hand is 98. Total pipeline+on-hand = 486. With an average demand of ~100/period and L=4, we need coverage for 5 periods (~500 units). The OR backend's capped policy will ensure we reach the appropriate base stock level based on the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $964.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without a clear trend or seasonal shift since the start. The mean demand across all 16 periods is approximately 99.4, and the standard deviation is approximately 22.4. Current on-hand inventory is 138 units, and there are 390 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Since there are no detected regime shifts in demand or lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L (which is the promised lead time of 4) and 'recent_N' with N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most accurate recent distribution of demand across the review and lead time window (L+1=5 periods). This provides a robust baseline for the OR engine to maintain service levels while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2797.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 17 showed a significant spike to 151 units, compared to the general mean of around 100-110 units. While one data point is not a sustained trend, the variability (std dev) has increased, and inventory levels are sensitive. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since my current on-hand (72) and in-transit (352) sum up to 424, and the demand forecast for (1+L=5) periods based on the overall mean (~101) would be ~505, I am slightly under-protected against high demand scenarios. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mean and standard deviation to capture more of the recent demand volatility while keeping the lead time method as 'calculate' since it has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1841.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, though it exhibits significant variance with a recent spike of 151 in Period 17 followed by 99 in Period 18. Calculating from Period 1 to 18, the mean demand is approximately 101.2 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival history (every order from P1 to P14 has arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Current on-hand is 40 and in-transit is 432, totaling 472 units. At a mean of 101.2, 5 periods of demand is ~506 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it accurately captures the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (the length of the stable regime since the inventory started flowing) to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the recent peak in Period 17.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 72 units. In-transit inventory is 432 units, comprising orders from Period 16 (100), 17 (47), 18 (147), and 19 (138). Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods as scheduled. Demand over the last 19 periods (since period 5 demand was the first filled) shows a mean of approximately 102 units per period (Avg of P5-P19 is 102.3). Total demand across the review and lead period (1+L = 5 periods) is approximately 511 units. The current pipeline (72 on-hand + 432 in-transit = 504) is nearly perfectly aligned with the expected 5-period demand (511). There are no detected regime shifts in demand or lead time; demand fluctuates between 58 and 151 with no sustained trend. I will continue using the default lead time and a recent 15-period window (P5-P19) to calculate the mean and standard deviation, as this covers the actual fulfillment history.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first 20 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-20) is approximately 104 units, with the last 10 periods (11-20) showing a similar mean of 104.4 units. I will use the recent_N method (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while maintaining stability. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in periods 5 through 20), which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use the default lead time setting (L=4). Currently, there are 436 units in-transit (orders from P17-P20) and 46 units on-hand. The pipeline of 482 units is sufficient to cover the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), and the OR backend's capped policy will adjust the order to maintain the base stock levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 521 units in-transit. An arrival of 147 units (ordered in P18) is expected during P22, meaning we are currently in a stock-out state based on P21's conclusion. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since P1, demand has fluctuated but generally stayed within a stable range (mean ~100.5, std ~20). Recent demand has shown some volatility but no clear structural shift or seasonality markers (as specific dates aren't provided). I will use a window of the last 15 samples to capture recent demand trends while smoothing out transient noise. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of the 4-period lead time. Parameters are aimed at maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 47, but there was a stock-out in Period 21. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). The demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) has averaged 105.3 units, compared to the overall average of 103.4. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the service level (q) is approximately 95%, making the backend inventory policy aggressive. I will use the recent 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and prevent further stock-outs, while keeping L at the default (promised/confirmed) 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $955.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 20 periods (P4-P23) is approximately 101.45 units. The most recent demand (P23) was significantly lower at 57, but overall volatility is moderate (Std Dev ~25-28). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. I will use a 17-period lookback (from P7-P23) to calculate demand and volatility, as P1-P6 contained the initial inventory build-up and initial seed samples. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. The backend will use these parameters to target a base stock levels that accounts for the 128 units on-hand and the 431 units currently in-transit (orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23). Setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat yields a stable forecast based on the observed steady regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 149 units. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across all concluded shipments. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations without a clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift. The most recent demand (83 in Period 24, 57 in Period 23) is slightly lower than the overall mean (~100), but given the target service level (95%+), it is safer to use a broader sample size for stability. I will use the last 15 periods (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the variability since the system stabilized after the initial lead-time delay. This ensures we cover demand for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the high reward-to-cost ratio (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 25 shows a relatively stable pattern with an average demand of approximately 101.5 units per period. While there are fluctuations (ranging from 57 to 151), there is no clear sustained shift or seasonality evident in the generic period dates. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals since Period 5. The current on-hand inventory (138) plus in-transit (307) equals 445 units. Given L=4, we are covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~102, 5 periods require ~510 units. Our current pipeline (445) is slightly below this level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 (stable regime since Period 6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will provide a robust estimate based on the observed volatility and mean over the last 20 periods. The backend will then target a base stock roughly equal to (1+4) * mean + z * sigma * sqrt(5), maintaining a high service level due to the significant profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1428.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5 through Period 26 consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (arrived=Y units ordered on Period X, lead_time was 4 periods). I am using 'method': 'calculate' for lead time to allow the OR backend to utilize this stable observation. Regarding demand, the mean over the most recent 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 100.8 units, while the overall average since Period 1 is 100.2. There is no significant sustained shift in mean or variance detected (demand fluctuates between 57 and 151). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand distribution. The current inventory position (On-hand: 149, In-transit: 358) covers roughly 5 periods of demand (~500 units), aligning with the Lead Time + Review Period (4+1) logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2170.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has fluctuated between approximately 60 and 150 units per period without a distinct seasonal trend or clear regime shift in the recent history. The mean demand for the last 15 periods (including samples provided in the user prompt and game history) is approximately 101.4 units, with a standard deviation of 26.8. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (381 units) plus current on-hand inventory (129 units) totals 510 units, which covers about 5 periods of average demand (approx. 507 units). Since the lead time is 4 periods and we are deciding for Period 28, we need to ensure local availability for P28, P29, P30, P31, and P32 (L+1 coverage). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture recent volatility while smoothing out extreme single-period outliers. Sigma_hat will also use N=15 to reflect the observed variance in this range. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1964.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable, with a mean demand of approximately 102 units over the last 20 periods (P9-P28) and 108 units over the last 10 periods. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in periods 25, 26, 27, and 28 (totaling 436 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in periods 29, 30, 31, and 32 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 69. To maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the base stock should cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use a recent_N of 20 to capture the stable demand mean and variance while filtering out early noise. This helps the OR backend set a safety stock that buffers against demand volatility while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 103 units, but exhibits significant volatility (standard deviation ~26). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 29 (demand 156 vs. supply 134). Pipeline inventory (468 units) consists of orders from Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29. Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals), the Period 26 order (145 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 30. To maintain a high service level (~95% given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the current demand regime's mean and variance while smoothing out the recent stockout spike. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a notable increase in the most recent periods, specifically in Period 29 (156) and Period 30 (150), compared to the earlier historical average of ~102. This upward trend, likely a short-term regime shift or seasonal spike, led to stockouts in the last two periods as inventory could not meet the 150+ demand. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, I must ensure the pipeline (472 units in-transit) is sufficient to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). An average demand of ~106 units across the full history is likely too low given the recent jump; however, the backend's capped policy will limit extreme orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent higher activity while maintaining some stability against volatile spikes, and 'default' for sigma to ensure we account for the variation seen in the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 29: average demand increased from ~102 to ~153 (+50%) over the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant shift starting at Period 29. While previous demand averaged around 100 units, the observations for Periods 29 and 30 were 156 and 150 respectively. Period 31 recorded 0 demand, which is highly anomalous given the preceding spike and likely represents a data reporting lag or a specific localized event rather than a trend reversal, especially as inventory was available to sell. To capture the recent higher demand regime while smoothing out the Period 31 anomaly, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 27-31), which averages approximately 107 units per period. This incorporates the high demand peaks while acknowledging the zero-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (L=4). Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will account for the increased volatility caused by the shift from high demand to the zero-demand outlier, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer in the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1194.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has shown a significant shift. While the average demand from Period 1 to 28 was approximately 102 units, Period 29 and 30 saw spikes to 156 and 150. Period 31 reported 0 demand (likely an outlier or data lag), and Period 32 returned to 71. However, the 'Carry-over Insights' confirm a regime shift starting Period 29 with an expected average of ~153. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand state while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime. Lead time (L) is stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent historical arrivals (P28 order arrived P32), so I stick with the 'default' method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1888.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the data (e.g., P29 order arrived in P33 resolution). Demand analysis: While Period 29 and 30 showed a spike (~153), Period 31 had 0 demand and Periods 32-33 returned to levels near the historical average (71 and 107). However, the initial samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82 - avg 97) and most of the game history suggest a baseline demand around 100. The Carry-over insight regarding a +50% shift seems less sustained given recent demand (0, 71, 107). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent cluster including the spike and the subsequent correction (Avg P28-P33 is ~81, but weighted by the earlier high demand, N=6 covers the transition). Specifically, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility and uncertainty observed since Period 28. Status: On-hand + In-transit (145 + 491 = 636) is high, likely due to the zero demand in P31, so the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has become highly volatile but shows a generally higher average since Period 29. While the earlier carry-over insight noted a 50% increase, the most recent periods (P31-P34) have shown a mix of low demand (0, 71, 107, 42) following two high spikes. Averaging the demand from the shift (P29-P34) gives a mean of approximately 87.6 units, which is actually lower than the pre-shift average of ~102. However, the system must account for the high lead time (4 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 252 and in-transit at 411, total pipeline is 663. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the recent regime shift's volatility while ensuring we don't over-order during this dip in demand. This targets a safety stock that accommodates the high variance observed (0 to 156).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly since Period 29 (range 0-156), making recent mean-based forecasting less reliable than variance-adjusted models.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4716.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime starting from Period 29. Recent demand samples show a wide range: Period 29 (156), Period 30 (150), Period 31 (0), Period 32 (71), Period 33 (107), Period 34 (42), and Period 35 (256). The mean of the last 7 periods (since the shift) is approximately 111.7, which is only slightly higher than the historical average (~102), but the variance has spiked significantly. The carry-over insight from P35 correctly identified this increased volatility. To handle this, I will use a larger N for demand mean (mu_hat) to smooth out the noise while capturing the overall regime level, and use a shorter window for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the recent massive swings (like the 256 spike in P35). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 148, with 261 in transit (orders from P32-35). These parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which requires protecting against stockouts during these unpredictable spikes.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility confirmed: Period 31-35 demand sequence (0, 71, 107, 42, 256) indicates high variance around a shift mean of ~112 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 29) shows a significantly higher mean and higher volatility. Demand in the last 8 periods (P29-P36) has been: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120. The mean of this recent segment is approximately 112.75 units per period. However, given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is critical to capture the peaks (like the 256 units in P35). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the order decision, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased variance and the shift in demand style while filtering out the older, lower-demand data (P1-P28) that would underestimate current requirements.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2082.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 29-37) shows higher mean and significant volatility compared to the earlier baseline. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 113 units, but with high variance (values ranging from 0 to 256). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 103 units with a large 'in-transit' pipeline of 566 units. Given the high volatility and the fact that we have already placed large orders in Period 36 (252) and Period 37 (243), the priority is ensuring the OR backend uses a sufficiently large mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the potential 200+ unit spikes seen in Period 35. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the current high-variance regime while ensuring the lead time is set to the observed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1568.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 29. Recent demand samples (P29-P38: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120, 115, 87) show a mean of approximately 110.4 units, but with significant swings including a zero-demand period and a 256-unit peak. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 664 units, which is quite high compared to the cycle demand, primarily due to large orders placed in Periods 36 and 37 (252 and 243 units respectively) to compensate for earlier high demand. These large shipments are expected to arrive in Periods 40 and 41. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility observed in the last 10 periods, I will use a 10-period window to capture this increased variance while smoothing the mean. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety stock (via sigma_hat) to handle the spikes without over-ordering excessively during the lower-demand lulls.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 40. On-hand inventory is 0 after a complete stockout in Period 39 (demand 129 vs 87 available). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since Period 29, the demand has entered a high-volatility regime with a higher mean than the initial 28 periods. Calculating demand for the last 11 periods (P29-P39: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120, 115, 87, 129), the average is approximately 112 units per period. The recent volatility is extreme (standard deviation of ~70). To handle this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (recent_N=11) to capture this new regime while ignoring the pre-shift data. Using explicit methods for L ensures we account for the 4-period lead time precisely. This configuration balances the high profitability of the SKU ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by aiming for a high service level in a volatile environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-39 confirms a mean shift to ~112 units with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~70) compared to the Period 1-28 average of ~102.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility since Period 29. The most recent demand (Period 40) was 124 units, which aligns with the observed regime shift average of ~112 units. Since Period 29, demand has ranged from 0 to 256, necessitating a robust estimate of both mean and variance. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. For Period 41, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 (covering the period since the regime shift at P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean (~117) and significantly increased standard deviation compared to the early game. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio while acknowledging the recent instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1389.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 continues to exhibit high volatility (Period 29-41 mean \u2248 111, StdDev \u2248 64). The latest demand observation of 88 units remains within this expected volatile range. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P37 order arrived at P41). Pipeline inventory (429) + On-hand (283) is 712 units, which is high compared to the (~5 period) protection horizon of ~555 units (based on mean 111). However, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit ordering if inventory is excessive. To accurately capture the increased volatility noted in the carry-over insights and recent history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the start of the regime shift at P29 to the present) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend uses a sufficiently high service level (z-score) to handle potential spikes like the 256 units seen in Period 35, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units since Period 29, following a high-volatility regime. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 124, 88, 96) shows a move towards more moderate and consistent levels compared to the extreme swings observed between Periods 31-35. However, historical volatility (StdDev ~70) remains high. lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 354 and in-transit at 331, the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach (N=14, covering the period from the regime shift at P29 to now) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior while smoothing out the extreme individual peaks like the 256 seen in Period 35, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient but not excessive safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 29-43) shows a mean of ~112 units but extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~62), with individual periods ranging from 0 to 256. The previous insights correctly identified this shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (319) and substantial in-transit stock (354), we are well-covered for the current (L+1) window. I will continue using the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) starting from the changepoint at Period 29 (N=15) to capture this high-variance regime while allowing the OR engine to maintain a buffer that prevents stockouts during the frequent spikes seen in this period range.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 29-44) shows an average demand of approximately 109 units (1750 total / 16 periods) with high volatility. The last five periods (P40-P44) have shown more stable demand (mean ~101), but the overall variance remains significantly higher than the pre-P29 period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P40 order in P44. Current on-hand inventory is 299 with 352 in-transit, totaling 651 units. With a lead time of 4 and 1 decision period (1+L=5), the pipeline needs to support approximately 5 * 109 = 545 units plus a safety stock buffer for high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this more volatile regime's mean and standard deviation, which provides a weighted approach to the increased uncertainty while acknowledging the current high inventory position.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units since Period 29, but with significantly higher volatility compared to the early game. Over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand has been 88, 96, 95, 104, 69, which averages to 90.4; however, the broader regime since Period 29 remains the more reliable basis for forecasting and safety stock given the frequent spikes (e.g., 256 in P35). On-hand inventory is healthy at 348 units, and in-transit inventory is 330 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by the continuous 'conclude' messages. To balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I am using recent_N (N=17, covering the period from the known shift at P29 to P45) to capture the higher variance and adjusted mean for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to handle potential future spikes while acknowledging the current high on-hand position.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115 units since the significant volatility noted earlier (Period 29-39). Over the last 6 periods (P41-P46), demand has averaged approximately 88 units (88, 96, 95, 104, 69, 74), indicating a slight cooling from the peak volatility period but remaining higher and more variable than the initial baseline (P1-P28). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 343 units on hand and 315 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. To maintain the 95% service level while accounting for the recent standard deviation, I will use a recent_N strategy for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 15 periods to capture the post-shift behavior without overreacting to the very recent low-demand cluster. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (L+1=5) while factoring in the sustained higher variance observed since Period 29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1494.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game is nearing completion. Reviewing the demand history since the regime shift at Period 29, the average demand has been approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of 63. However, looking at the very recent period (P41-P47), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 86 units. Given that we have 330 units on-hand and 277 units in-transit (total pipeline of 607 units), and only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), our current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Any further large orders will only incur unnecessary holding costs at the end of the game. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as lead times have been consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the slightly lower recent demand levels and volatility, which will signal to the OR engine that the stock level is already high relative to expected demand, effectively minimizing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed since Period 41: demand has softened to an average of ~86 units compared to the higher volatility/mean seen between P29-P40 (~112 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 41, showing a lower mean of approximately 86 units and significantly reduced volatility compared to the P29-P40 period. The last 8 periods (P41-P48) have a mean demand of 85.75 units and a standard deviation of 14.5. The promised lead time of 4 holds consistent in historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory (348) plus in-transit (195) equals 543 units. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline should cover 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~86, the target base stock is approximately 430 units. Since current total inventory (543) exceeds our target base stock, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero or minimal order to allow inventory to bleed down, reducing holding costs. I will set L to 4, and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P41 stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1876.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand, moderate-volatility regime starting around Period 41. The average demand since Period 41 is approximately 89 units (88, 96, 95, 104, 69, 74, 96, 64, 116). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals. Current on-hand inventory (328) plus in-transit stock (99) equals 427 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the review period (1), we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean demand of ~89 units, the expected demand over the window is ~445 units. Our current inventory position (427) is nearly sufficient to cover this, explaining the recent '0' order quantities by the backend. To ensure the OR backend reacts to the softened mean (approx 89) rather than the older high-volatility mean (approx 112) or the long-term average, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (capturing the regime from Period 41-49) to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a safe service level.
