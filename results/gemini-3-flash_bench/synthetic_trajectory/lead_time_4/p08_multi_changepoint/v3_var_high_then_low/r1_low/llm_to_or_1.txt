Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we only have historical demand data for 5 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the mean demand is 96.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 19.95. As there are no calendar dates or specific product descriptions beyond 'chips(Regular)', I will use the baseline statistics. Given the lead time L=4, the coverage needs to be for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the 'default' methods will allow the backend to use all available historical samples to set the base stock level. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, so the OR engine will place an initial stock-up order based on the calculated base_stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 132 units with a promised lead time of 4. Since the lead time is greater than 0, the order could not have arrived in Period 1 (confirmed by arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). We started with 0 inventory and faced a demand of 110, resulting in 110 lost sales. Current in-transit is 132. Demand samples for Period 1-5 show a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 20.3. Since we only have one period of game history (Period 1 demand = 110), but we have 5 pre-game samples, I will use all available data (N=6 total, but backend uses all samples for 'default'). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for 1+4=5 periods. mu_hat = (1+4) * 96.8 = 484. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+4) * 20.3 = 45.4. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to use all historical data points effectively.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 2 (132 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, given the lead time sequence. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed demand in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand history shows Period_1: 71, Period_2: 120, Period_3: 95, Period_4: 116, Period_5: 82 (note: the 'GAME HISTORY' demand for P1 and P2 is reported as 110 and 145, which differs slightly from the provided sample sequence; I will prioritize the game history demand of 110 and 145 for the most recent calculations). The mean demand of the first two periods is (110+145)/2 = 127.5. With L=4, the base stock should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level observed in the game history.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered so far (132 + 132 + 169 = 433) are correctly in-transit. Demand for the first three periods was 110, 145, and 113. Using the provided historical samples for periods 1-5 (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the mean demand is approximately 96.8 units per period. Since we have no evidence of lead time deviation yet (as no orders were expected to arrive before Period 5), I will use the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative average of all 5 available samples (96.8) multiplied by (1+L) = 5, which equals 484. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the 5 samples is approximately 20.8, leading to a forecast volatility of 20.8 * sqrt(5) \u2248 46.5. These parameters provide a balanced approach until actual lead time performance is observed after Period 5.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. However, since the 'Period 5 conclude' message is not yet available (it will be seen at the start of Period 6), the current on-hand inventory is 0. All demand for Periods 1-4 has been lost due to zero stock. The total in-transit quantity is 484 units (the sum of orders from P1-P4: 132+132+169+51). Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of approximately 96.8. Since there is no confirmed lead-time drift or demand regime shift yet (only 5 samples), I will use the default promised lead time and calculate parameters based on all recent historical samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock calculation. The OR backend will use these to determine the order for P5, considering the 484 units already in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-62.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, we have processed 5 periods of demand and arrival data. The promised lead time is 4. Period 5 conclude confirmed an arrival of 132 units ordered in Period 1, verifying the actual lead time L=4. Demand history: P1=71, P2=120, P3=95, P4=116, P5=82 (as provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' block. Note: The game history 'demand' values are higher, likely including backlogs or pre-arrival accumulation, but I will prioritize the provided sample statistics for forecasting). Demand Mean: 96.8, Std: 20.7. Current Inventory: 97 (on-hand) + 406 (in-transit). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 96.8 = 484. sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 20.7 \u2248 46.2. The backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place a capped order. I'll use 'default' for L and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the full sample set as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The history shows demand is relatively stable but with some fluctuations (Sample mean ~96). Lead time is now confirmed to be 4 periods as both the Period 1 and Period 2 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later (arriving in P5 and P6 respectively). This confirms the promised lead time holds. Currently, we have 123 units on-hand and 274 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). In-transit inventory should cover the upcoming 4 periods of demand. I will use the baseline promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the average demand seen during the game periods [110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106]. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' to capture the high variance observed in early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-148.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has been somewhat volatile but stable (mean ~95 over 7 periods). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 220 units. Total in-transit is 206 (orders from P4, P5, P7). Following the lead time definition (L=4), we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The historical average demand is 95.7 units per period. 5 periods * 95.7 = 478.5. Total pipeline (On-hand 220 + In-transit 206) = 426. We are slightly below the target coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed history of demand, as there's no clear regime shift yet. L will be 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived on time). Current inventory is healthy: on-hand is 159, and in-transit is 207 (from orders in P5, P7, and P8; note P6 had 0 ordered). Total pipeline (366) covers the next 5 periods (L+1) if demand remains near the mean (~98). I will use the recent mean demand since the start of the game (N=8) to set mu_hat, which results in a base stock level roughly equivalent to (1+L) * mean. With lead time confirmed at 4, L=4 is appropriate.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. All 5 concluded orders arrived exactly with L=4. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 98 units per period over the 9 recorded periods, with a standard deviation of approximately 30. The current on-hand inventory is 112 units, and pipeline inventory is 276 units (orders from P7, P8, and P9). Given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend will target a base stock level equal to the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use the last 5 periods (Period 5-9) to estimate demand parameters as they represent the period of stable availability and observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at a critical stockout (0 on-hand inventory). In Period 10, demand (121) exceeded starting on-hand (112), resulting in 9 units of lost sales. Our pipeline inventory is 314 units. Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 6 (0 units) to arrive in Period 10 (already passed, was 0), and the order from Period 7 (101 units) to arrive in Period 11. However, since we currently see 0 units arrived in the Period 10 conclude message, we must prepare for the Period 11 arrival phase. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-9). Demand has shown a significant shift: Periods 1-4 averaged ~114, but Periods 5-10 have fluctuated with an average of 91. To stabilize, I will use recent_N=6 for demand (covering the shift from Period 5 onwards) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower demand trend against the stockout risk seen in late Period 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 12. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11). Note that Period 6 had 0 ordered units, resulting in 0 arrivals in Period 10, which caused a stockout (ending inventory 0, 9 units lost demand). Period 11 demand was 67. The historical mean demand across all 11 periods is (110+145+113+88+35+106+72+112+101+121+67)/11 \u2248 97.3. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the more recent variability (mean of last 6: 106, 72, 112, 101, 121, 67 \u2248 96.5), which is aligned with the overall average. Given lead time L=4, the OR backend requires mu_hat for (1+L)=5 periods. Setting L to calculate/default is safe as observed lead times match promised values. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle standard volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Last period's demand (107) was unmet due to stockout (only 86 sold). We have 397 units in-transit. Historic demand data (including pre-game samples) shows a relatively stable mean around 95-100 units. Mean of Period 1-12 demand is approximately 98. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) shows volatility (121, 67, 107). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5-P9/P11-P12 concludes; P10 had no arrival because P6 order was 0 units). Since lead time is stable at 4, L+1 = 5. I will use the last 10 periods of demand (which covers the available game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced forecast without overreacting to the stockout period (P10/P12), while accounting for the inherent variance of the Regular Chips SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in almost all deliveries (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9). However, the order from Period 6 (ordered 0) is trivial, and the order from Period 10 (38 units) was expected to arrive in Period 14 (this period) but we currently see 0 on-hand at the start of the period decision phase. Historically, demand has been volatile, but there is no clear seasonal trend yet as the date is abstract. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows an average of 105.2, while the full history average is approximately 100.2. Given the stockouts in Periods 10, 12, and 13 (despite arrivals), the service level (profit / (profit + holding) = 0.5) implies the backend targets the median. To prevent stockouts caused by variability and potential delays, I will use a slightly larger window for demand (N=10) to capture a stable mean while acknowledging recent volatility. I will maintain Lead Time at the promised 'default' of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 14 (only 38 units arrived against 90 units of demand). All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14). Demand has remained relatively stable without a clear changepoint, though there is moderate volatility. The current in-transit inventory is 432 units, which represents orders from P11 (142), P12 (94), P13 (64), and P14 (132). These are scheduled to arrive in P15, P16, P17, and P18 respectively. For Period 15, I will use 'calculate' for lead time (L) since the 4-period lead time is consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all historical samples) to capture the broad demand profile (Periods 1-14 + seeded data), as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P15) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. A shipment from Period 6 appears to be missing (no arrived notice despite being 10 periods ago), so I will rely on the observed consistency of other shipments using 'calculate'. Demand has been relatively stable but shows high volatility, with a mean of approximately 101 across 15 periods. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages 95.4. Given the stockout risk seen in P10-P14, the OR backend needs to maintain a slightly higher base stock to offset potential lead-time gaps or missing shipments. I'll use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately while providing sufficient buffer for the 5-period (L+1) exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Order from Period 6 (0 units) concluded as never arrived - confirmed lost shipment. Actual lead time for successful shipments remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after early noise, with the mean demand over the last 10 periods being approximately 96.3 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in all successful shipments (Periods 5-9, 11-16), with only one lost shipment (Period 6 order never arriving). Currently, we have 89 units on-hand and 357 units in-transit (orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Since L+1 = 5 periods, and our pipeline (357) + on-hand (89) = 446 units, we are reasonably covered against the expected demand of ~480 units over the next 5 periods. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial volatile samples. The lead time method 'calculate' is used as it correctly reflects the 4-period historical average, and the backend OR logic will handle the base stock and safety stock calculations based on the profit/holding cost parity (q=0.5).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a slight downward trend compared to the initial periods. The mean demand of the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 97.7 units, which is lower than the overall mean of 97.1 including earlier spikes. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection period (L+1). Successful lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 321 reflects orders from P14 (132), P15 (63), P16 (98), and P17 (28). I will use a N=10 period window to capture the current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we cover the 5-period risk window (L+1=5) without over-stocking given the 1:1 cost structure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of 96.6 units per period across all 18 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as noted in Carry-over Insights and evidenced by recent arrivals from P10-P14 arriving in P14-P18). Currently, we have 36 units on-hand and 291 units in-transit (ordered P15, P16, P17, P18). With a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The pipeline (291) plus on-hand (36) equals 327 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 483 units (5 * 96.6). This suggests we are under-stocked relative to upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=18) to capture the long-term stable mean while allowing the system to adjust for recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' (N=18) to provide a robust estimate of variation. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 matches observations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20. Historical analysis confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (P18 arrived on P23, etc.), despite one lost shipment from Period 6. The promised lead time L=4 is consistent with observations. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some recent volatility, with Period 18 and 19 showing higher demand (157, 150) compared to the long-term average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to 150 units of demand exceeding the 99 available units in Period 19. Total in-transit is 378 (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19). We expect an arrival of 98 units (ordered P16) in Period 20's arrival resolution. Given the recent demand uptick, I will base the forecast on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher mean and volatility, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent demand levels (approx 109 units/period). This will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 20 samples average 102.35). Current on-hand is 78. Pipeline inventory is 448 units (which includes previous orders from P17-P20). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, except for a single lost shipment from Period 6. The OR backend's service level q = 0.5 (as Profit=1 and Holding=1), implying the model aims for the median demand. I'll use recent_N (N=20) for demand parameters to capture the full history since the game stabilized after the initial lead-time gap, and the default (promised) lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the chips(Regular) SKU is facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the history of successful arrivals. Demand analysis shows a significant increase in volatility and mean in the most recent periods (e.g., Period 21: 190, Period 19: 150, Period 18: 157). Although there are 420 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 18-21), they will begin arriving in Period 22 through 25. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (q = 0.5), making accurate parameter settings crucial for avoiding carry-over stockouts. To account for the recent demand surge and high volatility, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility with N=7 (covering Periods 15-21) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting ~Period 18: Mean and volatility have increased significantly compared to silent baseline periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are facing an inventory stock-out (On-hand: 0). History shows regular lead times are stable at 4 periods. A demand regime shift was identified around Period 18, so I am focusing on recent history to capture the new mean and volatility. Demand values since P18: 157, 150, 20, 190, 109. The average demand in this 5-period window is ~125, compared to the earlier baseline. Given the high volatility (fluctuations between 20 and 190), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to adjust to the higher mean and increased risk of stock-outs. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by multiple historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, and now 23). The shipment from Period 20 (168 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 24. Since Period 18, a demand regime shift is evident with increased mean and volatility (Demand: P18=157, P19=150, P20=20, P21=190, P22=109, P23=88). The average demand over the last 6 periods is ~119, with significant variance (20 to 190). To capture this new regime while remaining responsive to the high volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand (~595 units) plus a safety buffer, subtracting the current pipeline (476) and on-hand (62).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods and the 'Period 24 conclude' message confirms that the Period 20 order (168 units) arrived exactly 4 periods later. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 18, we have observed a demand regime shift with higher mean and volatility. Historical demands from Period 18 onwards are: 157, 150, 20, 190, 109, 88, 120. The average of these last 7 periods is approximately 119. However, the sequence shows significant volatility (from 20 to 190). To capture this new regime while smoothing out the extreme low in Period 20, I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. With L=4, the OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Current on-hand is 110 and in-transit is 365, totaling 475. This buffer is necessary given the high volatility and $1 profit vs $1 holding cost risk profile.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. Historical data indicates a significant demand regime shift approximately at Period 18. Recent demand (P18-P25) has shown both higher peaks (up to 190) and lower troughs (down to 10), increasing overall volatility. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since P25 concluded with 0 units arrived (matching the order of 0 units from P21), the pipeline inventory remains intact with no confirmed losses since P14. Given the high volatility in the new regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current mean and standard deviation for the period 18-25 regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased uncertainty and protects against stockouts during the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-110.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27. Looking at the confirmed history, the lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P22 order arriving in P26). In-transit inventory (366 units) currently consists of orders from P23 (188), P24 (57), and P25 (121). Note that P21 had an order of 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in P25 conclude. The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting ~Period 18) persists, but recent periods (P25=10, P26=55) suggest high volatility rather than a sustained mean increase. Evaluating demand since the regime shift (P18-P26): 157, 150, 20, 190, 109, 88, 120, 10, 55. Mean of these 9 samples is ~99.8, with significant variance. I will use recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime while maintaining a baseline mean around 100 per period. A 4-period lead time requires (L+1)=5 periods of coverage (~500 units). Total Pipeline (165 on-hand + 366 in-transit) = 531, which is slightly above 5 periods of forecasted demand. The OR backend's service level logic (q = 1.0/(1.0+1.0) = 0.5) will target the median demand, balancing holding costs against stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderately high volatility regime since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 57 over the last 10 periods. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P26, P27 concludes) confirms the actual lead time L=4 is reliable. Current on-hand inventory is 269 units, and in-transit is 178 units (orders from P24 and P25). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 10 periods (N=10) provides a stable estimate of the current demand regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. Given the high volatility (sigma_hat), a slightly higher buffer is maintained to prevent stockouts like those seen in P19-P22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-208.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 29. Reviewing the history, the lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in Period 28, where the order from Period 24 arrived). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 267 units. A demand regime shift was noted around Period 18; however, recent demand (Periods 25-28) has shown a significant cooling trend (10, 55, 84, 59) compared to the spike seen in Periods 18-21. I will use a window of the last 11 periods (Period 18 to 28) to capture the post-shift behavior while accounting for this recent softening. This N=11 covers the higher demand period and the recent stabilization. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=11 balances the need to be responsive to the higher average demand of the current regime while not over-ordering based on the early-regime outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-342.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently high at 365 units following recent large arrivals from the Period 22-25 orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 25 order arriving in Period 29. A demand regime shift was noted around Period 18, but recent observations (Periods 25-29) show a notable slowdown in demand (avg 46.2 over last 5 periods) compared to the spike seen in Periods 18-24 (avg 111). This suggests the high-demand regime may be subsiding or highly volatile. With on-hand inventory (365) and in-transit (86) totaling 451 units, and the promised lead time of 4 requiring coverage for 5 periods (L+1), current stock is sufficient. Using recent_N=12 for demand capturing the full volatility since the regime shift began, while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a spike (P18-P24), demand has significantly cooled in P25-P29 (avg ~46), leading to high on-hand inventory reserves.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory (310 on-hand units) due to a significant demand cooling observed starting from Period 25. The average demand in the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 47.6, compared to much higher volatility in the preceding 'spike' period (P18-P24). We are holding enough stock to cover over 6 periods of this recent average. In-transit inventory stands at 86 units, consisting of orders from P28 (45) and P29 (41); the P27 order was 0, explaining the zero arrival in P31 history (observed at start of P32). Since Lead Time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent excessive accumulation while the OR backend burns through the surplus. I'll use a recent window of N=6 to capture the lower demand regime while keeping L at the stable observed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the recent regime (P18-P31). After a period of cooling (P25-P30, avg ~46), Period 31 saw a significant spike to 138 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 172 units, which provides a substantial buffer, but the recent demand spike and the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (reflecting a 50% target service level) suggest we should not over-respond. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the shift from low demand (P25-P30) back to high demand (P31), I will use the last 7 periods (P25-P31) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the recent low-demand cluster and the latest spike, averaging to approximately 60.5 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Following a low-demand phase (P25-P30 avg ~46), a high-demand spike occurred in P31 (138 units), suggesting sustained high variance in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-119.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently exhibiting high volatility. Following a low-demand phase (P25-P30 average ~46), we saw a spike in P31 (138) and a moderate value in P32 (49). The current on-hand inventory is 168 units with 86 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high variance and the recent demand shift observed starting around Period 18, I am using a recent_N approach for demand forecasting to capture the current regime's behavior while accounting for the significant volatility. Specifically, N=15 covers the period from P18 to P32, encompassing the high-growth phase and the subsequent volatile fluctuations. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR engine set a base stock that balances the high holding cost (equal to profit) against the risk of stockouts during demand spikes. The high on-hand inventory suggests we are currently well-covered, so the OR backend should naturally moderate new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-155.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as noted in the carry-over insights. The most recent demand (P33) was low (27), following a sequence of fluctuating values (49, 138, 55, 23). The average demand over the last 15 periods (since the regime shift around P18) is approximately 84, but with significant variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is 182 units and in-transit is 223 units (total 405). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median of the demand distribution over (L+1) periods. To avoid further inventory bloat while protecting against spikes like P31, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the increased mean of the current regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to allow the OR engine to account for the high observed volatility in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P32-P34) shows a return to lower levels (49, 27, 29) following the spike in P31 (138). However, the overall regime since P18 remains characterized by high volatility (coefficient of variation > 0.5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost shipment from P21 (ordered Period 21, never arrived). I am currently carrying a high on-hand inventory (153 units) and significant in-transit stock (223 units), totaling 376 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, the pipeline needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a regime mean around 70-80 units, current total stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. For parameters, I will use a recent window (N=17) for mu_hat to capture the shift that started in P18, and recent_N (N=17) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this period range. L remains at the default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 21 (no conclusion by P34). Current regime (P18-P34) continues to show high volatility despite low recent demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high demand of 164 units in Period 35 confirmed the extreme volatility of the current regime (starting ~Period 18), consistent with the 'high-low' alternating spikes (e.g., P31: 138, P35: 164). This surge exhausted the previous inventory surplus, leaving us with 0 on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful shipments, though lost shipments (Period 21) continue to punctuate the history. The current in-transit inventory of 248 units must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the recent demand surge and high variance, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the statistics of the current volatile regime (P18-P35) while smoothing out the extreme week-to-week noise. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the high-variance peaks without over-ordering during the intervening lulls.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 18 confirmed as high-variance/intermittent: Periods of very low demand (20-30 units) are punctuated by sharp spikes (138-190 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is characterized by high variance and intermittency, with recent demand showing a mix of extreme spikes (P31: 138, P35: 164, P36: 111) and sharp troughs. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 380 in-transit. A notable delivery gap occurred in Period 35/36 as the order from Period 31 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrivals, and the order from Period 21 is confirmed lost. Since the current regime began in P18 (19 samples ago), I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the higher mean and volatility of this phase. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current high-demand spikes while recognizing the increased risk of stockouts during this volatile period. The lead time L is set to default (4) as successful deliveries consistently follow this pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is characterized by high variance and intermittency, with sharp spikes (110-164 units) following quiet periods. Recent demand (P35-P37: 164, 111, 110) shows a sustained high-demand cluster. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful deliveries, though some shipments are lost (P21). Current inventory is 68 units on-hand with 254 in-transit. Given the high volatility and the fact that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock policy will target the mean demand over (L+1) periods. Using a recent_N (N=20) captures the increased mean and variance of this second regime (P18-P37) more accurately than the full history, ensuring the backend maintains enough pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window without over-committing during low-demand troughs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P18-P37 shows a mean of ~88 units with high variance; recent 3 periods (P35-P37) indicate a sustained cluster of high demand (~128 avg).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 18) is characterized by high volatility and an average demand of approximately 88 units. Over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has been consistently high (164, 111, 110, 101), averaging 121.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand cluster. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 369 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P35 (25 units), P36 (177 units), P37 (52 units), and P38 (115 units) to arrive in P39, P40, P41, and P42 respectively. The order from P34 was 0 units. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-demand cluster (avg ~122). Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time. This will ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the current elevated demand while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 35 shows sustained high demand: last 4 periods (P35-P38) average 121.5 units, compared to the broader regime mean of ~88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P35-P39) shows a significant and sustained increase, with an average of approximately 121 units/period, compared to the broader high-variance regime starting at P18 (~88 units). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and have lost sales in the last four consecutive periods. Although 554 units are in-transit, the immediate demand pressure requires a robust mu_hat setting. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this specific high-demand cluster (P35-P39) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this ~121 average. Given the high volatility observed throughout the P18-P39 period (Standard Deviation approx 50-60), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 125. This value (representing ~55 * sqrt(5)) provides a buffer against the frequent 130-190 unit spikes seen in the history, helping to minimize lost sales in a high-profit/high-opportunity-cost scenario. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster confirmed P35-P39: Average demand increased to ~121 units (+37% vs P18-P34 average).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 35 to a high-demand cluster. The average demand from Period 35 to 40 is approximately 121 units (samples: 164, 111, 110, 101, 120, 119), compared to the broader historical mean. On-hand inventory is 58, and there is a significant pipeline in-transit (429 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments (P6, P21). To maintain the target service level given the current high-demand regime and high volatility, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~121 and the associated variance. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of this high-demand behavior.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. We are in a confirmed high-demand regime that started around Period 35, with recent demand (P35-P41) averaging approximately 116.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is very low (9 units), and we have a significant in-transit pipeline of 495 units. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P38 (115 units), P39 (210 units), P40 (52 units), and P41 (118 units) over the next four periods. The current regime is characterized by high demand (mean ~116) and moderate-to-high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this specific high-demand cluster (P35-P41). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the variance observed within this recent period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized into a high-demand cluster. The last 8 periods (P35-P42) show an average demand of 117.25 units, which is significantly higher than the overall history and the P18-P34 average. Lead times for successful shipments are consistently at 4 periods (P35 arrived at P39, P36 at P40, P37 at P41, P38 at P42). On-hand inventory is currently low (12 units) with an in-transit pipeline of 466 units. Given the transition into this high-demand phase, I am using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current mean (~117) and the associated volatility of this specific regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current 5-period risk window (L+1) while acknowledging the high service level required by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (q=0.5, though the OR backend uses this for Z-score calculation).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P35-P42): Average demand is 117.25 units, showing lower variance than the P18-P34 window but significantly higher mean than the initial baseline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 35 remains stable, with demand over the last 9 periods (P35-P43) averaging approximately 112 units. This is a significant increase from previous periods and suggests a sustained higher mean. Lead times for successful shipments have been consistently 4 periods (P35 arrived P39, P36 arrived P40, P37 arrived P41, P38 arrived P42, P39 arrived P43). Current on-hand inventory is 150 units with 365 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43). Given the lead time is 4, we are covering demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of 112, the required base stock is roughly 560 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 515 units, indicating a slight need for additional ordering to maintain the target service level. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this established higher demand regime (P35-P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the prometed lead time of 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 35 to a sustained high-demand phase. For the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 114.9 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44), demand has been consistently high with a mean of 101.8 and lower variance compared to the volatile P18-P34 period. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P40-P44 arrivals all had lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 97 units, with 360 units in-transit, providing decent coverage for the lead time plus review period (5 periods) given the current mean.

The demand regime remains in a high-sustained state (P35-P45), with the mean demand over the last 11 periods (P35-P45) at approximately 102 units. While slightly lower than the P35-P42 peak, it is significantly higher than the earlier high-variance period (P18-P34). The current on-hand inventory (135) and in-transit units (343) represent a healthy supply chain state, as recent shipments (P39-P41) have arrived consistently with the promised 4-period lead time. To maintain the inventory buffer for this high-demand regime, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime since P35) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the relevant volatility of this specific phase. Lead time (L) remains set to 'default' as recent arrivals confirm the 4-period window is currently stable.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High-demand regime (starting P35) stabilized at a mean of ~102 over the last 11 periods, with improved fulfillment consistency compared to previous regimes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 102 units (P35-P46 mean = 101.5), which is significantly higher than the early baseline but lower than the initial spike in the 120s. Volatility remains present but is more manageable than the P18-P34 era. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods for all fulfilled orders. Currently, we have 141 units on-hand and 323 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for $(1+L)=5$ periods. The current pipeline (464 units total) is well-positioned against the target of ~510 units ($102 	imes 5$). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full stability of this current regime (P35-P46) for both mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend adapts to the recent 102-unit average and its associated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-52.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 102 units (P35-P47 average is 106, but the more recent P43-P47 average is 89.2). Given the goal is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Cost) and both costs are $1.0/unit, the OR backend's service level target (profit/(profit+holding)) is 0.5. Current on-hand inventory is 151 and in-transit is 282, providing a total pipeline of 433 units. With a lead time of 4 and the current period (L+1=5), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. At the recent average of ~100 units/period, we require ~500 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P40-P43 orders all arrived in 4 periods). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the regime from P35-P47) to capture the current mean while smoothing recent fluctuation. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to account for the consistent variance in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 35 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 102 units and lower variance compared to the highly erratic P18-P34 period. Over the last 14 periods (P35-P48), the mean demand is 105.5 units. However, focusing on the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean is slightly lower at 98.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P40-P48 tracking perfectly with orders from P36-P44). With on-hand inventory at 113 and a large pipeline of 331 units, and only two periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), the goal is to prevent excessive holding costs while ensuring the final period's demand is met. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand environment, which effectively sets the base stock level to cover the remaining horizon without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 35. Over the last 15 periods (P35-P49), the mean demand is approximately 104.5 units per period. In the most recent 10-period window (P40-P49), the mean is slightly lower at 96.2 units, but with significantly reduced variance compared to the volatile P18-P34 segment. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate for all successful deliveries since Period 22. Currently, there are 113 units on-hand and 273 units in-transit (orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49). Given the high fulfillment consistency and the stabilization of demand mean around 100, I will use a recent 15-period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations in the last few periods. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock levels capable of covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~500 units) at the required service level.
