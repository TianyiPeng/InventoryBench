Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history yet, so the goal is to establish a baseline. The provided historical data (Periods 1-5) shows demand of [122, 121, 60, 83, 105]. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For the initial forecast, I'll calculate the mean (\u03bc \u2248 98.2) and standard deviation (\u03c3 \u2248 26.6) of these 5 samples. The OR backend requires mu_hat to be (1+L) \xd7 mean and sigma_hat to be sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std. I will use the 'explicit' method to set these values based on the full sample set to ensure a stable start while waiting for the first lead-time observations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and faced a demand of 118. An order of 142 units was placed but, per the lead-time mechanism, it will not arrive until Period 5 (promised lead time L=4). Consequently, we have a stockout. Historical demand for the 5 sample periods was [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], averaging 98.2. Since this is the very beginning of the simulation (Period 2), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline using the available sample data and the promised lead time. The in-transit inventory of 142 from P1 is consistent with the initial order.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (142 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, we have experienced 0 sales for the first two periods despite a total demand of 273 units. The demand for Period 1 was 118 (close to the sample Period_1: 122) and Period 2 was 155 (higher than the sample Period_2: 121). Given the current total inventory (in-transit) is 285 units and we face a lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure our order coverage (on-hand + in-transit) handles demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of all provided samples (98.2) and the observed demand (avg 136.5), the current in-transit amount only covers roughly 2 periods of recent demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and variance to capture the initial behavior, while keeping lead time at the promised 'default' of 4 until arrival data suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (142 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (approx. 118-155 units/period) cannot be met. Total in-transit is 449 units (142 + 143 + 164). Historical demand samples provided are [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], while the game history shows slightly different demand [118, 155, 128]. I will base my forecast on the game history demand which averages ~133. Given the Lead Time (L=4), we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using an average demand of 133, mu_hat should be approximately 665. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent history from the game logic.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (L=4). However, as of the start of Period 5, we have zero on-hand inventory and have sold zero units because no arrivals have concluded yet. Total in-transit is 615 units (142+143+164+166). The demand mean over the first 5 periods is approximately 118.2 units (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). Historical demand provided in the snippet is slightly different from the 'conclude' messages (which show 118, 155, 128, 117), so I will rely on the provided historical samples [122, 121, 60, 83, 105] which average 98.2. However, the 'conclude' Demand Resolution shows higher recent demand. Given the stockout (sold=0), we must ensure the base stock is high enough to recover once shipments land. I will use 'default' for L as no orders have concluded to prove otherwise. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent scale, and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand for the first 5 periods has been 118, 155, 128, 117, and 98, resulting in an average demand of 123.2 units per period. Currently, we have 44 units on hand and 481 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since the inventory view shows orders arriving as expected at L=4, I will stick with the promised lead time. For demand forecasting, I will use all available samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear regime shift yet. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), accounting for the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Average demand for P1-P5 is 123.2 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (arriving in the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and 6 respectively). This confirms the actual lead time L = 4 matches the promised lead time. Inventory is now flowing: we have 89 units on hand and 429 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Demand for the first six periods has been [118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98], with a mean of 119 and a standard deviation of 21.4. The most recent two periods show a slight dip to 98, but the sample size is too small to declare a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history while being slightly more responsive than the 'default' (which includes the pre-game samples). This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the observed demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-159.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'Period concluded' messages (P5, P6, P7) confirms a consistent actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows Period 1-4 averaged 129.5 units, while Period 5-7 averaged 81 units, indicating a recent slowdown. Given the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. Current on-hand (206) plus in-transit (342) equals 548 units. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N approach for demand (N=5 covers P3-P7, capturing the recent drop) provides a balanced mean of approximately 97.6 units/period (total 5-period demand ~488). The current pipeline of 548 is sufficient to cover this, so the OR backend will likely order a small replenishment or nothing, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining stock for the observed demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand dropped from ~130 (P1-P4) to ~80 (P5-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-206.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of past 'conclude' messages (P5 through P8) confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand data shows a significant downward shift: Period 1-4 demand averaged ~130 units, while Period 5-8 demand averaged 81.5 units (98, 98, 47, 83). This represents an approximate 37% decrease in demand. Currently, we have 289 units on-hand and 176 in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7), totaling 465 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand regime of ~82 units/period, the total coverage needed for L+1 (5 periods) is approximately 410 units. Because current inventory (465) exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will likely order 0 units this period, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat to use the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the lower demand regime, and L to calculate to stay aligned with the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 8: Mean demand decreased from ~130 to ~82 units (-37%) based on P5-P8 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-51.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift. Initial demand (P1-P4) averaged ~130 units, but more recent demand (P5-P9) has been more volatile, averaging ~90 units (98, 98, 47, 83, 123). Period 9 showed a sudden spike to 123, which suggests the previous low-demand regime might be shifting or was just a temporary dip. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9 concludes). Currently, we have 174 units on hand and 168 in transit (91 from P6, 77 from P7), totaling 342 units of pipeline inventory. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last 5 samples (P5-P9) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the older low-demand periods with the recent spike. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of 89.8 units/period and captures the recent volatility in sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-81.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1-P6 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand analysis shows a significant shift from the early periods (P1-P4 avg ~130) to a lower regime starting around P5. The last 6 periods (P5-P10) show a mean demand of 90.17 units (98, 98, 47, 83, 123, 92), with noticeable variance. The carry-over insights correctly identified this drop. Currently, we have 173 units on-hand and 184 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). The P7 order (77 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume, higher volatility regime (approx 90 units/period). This provides a base stock targets covering 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 450 units. With ~357 units current pipeline (173+184), the OR engine will place a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P5-P10): Mean demand ~90 units/period, down from ~130 in P1-P4. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P5-P11) shows a distinct regime shift compared to the initial periods. The mean demand for this recent period is approximately 98.6 units (calculated from P5: 98, P6: 98, P7: 47, P8: 83, P9: 123, P10: 92, P11: 119). This is significantly lower than the initial P1-P4 mean (~130 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With current on-hand inventory (131) and in-transit (201), we have safe coverage for the next few periods, but the OR backend needs to stabilize its forecast around this lower mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (P5-P11) while excluding the early high-demand noise. This helps the system avoid over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the expected arrival from Period 8 was 0 (ordered quantity was 0), which explains the arrived=0 observation. The on-hand inventory is now 47 units. The next expected arrival in Period 13 is from Period 9 (ordered 0), followed by Period 14 (arrival from Period 10 order of 107 units). Since Period 5, demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial surge. Mean demand for P5-P12 is approximately 93 units/period (total 744 / 8), which is significantly lower than the P1-P4 average of 129.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all concluded observations (P5-P11). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime (P5-P12) and avoid being skewed by the high initial demand in P1-P4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P5-P12): Mean demand ~93 units/period, compared to ~130 in P1-P4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is stock-depleted with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is 418 units, consisting of orders from Period 10 (107), Period 11 (94), Period 12 (136), and Period 13 (81). Based on 'Period 11 conclude' and historical data, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Therefore, the Period 10 order (107 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 14 and become visible in Period 15. The recent demand (Periods 5-13) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 94 units/period (total 847 / 9 periods), significantly lower than the initial P1-P4 mean of 130. However, the last four periods show slight volatility (mean ~100). Because holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the stable regime since Period 5) and L=4 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P5-P14) has averaged ~98 units, confirming the lower regime previously noted. There's a concern regarding missing shipments: orders from Period 8 and 9 should have arrived in Period 12 and 13 respectively, given the consistent 4-period lead time observed earlier. However, the 'Period 14 conclude' shows the order from Period 10 arriving, meaning the orders from Periods 8 and 9 (which were 0 and 0 units anyway) are effectively bypasses or lead times are steady and those $0$ orders were simply 'processed'. The order from P11 (94 units) is expected to arrive during P15. Current in-transit is 363 units (P11: 94, P12: 136, P13: 81, P14: 52). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Demand mean has stabilized around 98. Using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P8 and P9 (both 0 units) are confirmed as having 'arrived' or been bypassed, as the P10 order arrived on schedule (L=4). Demand regime is stable at ~98 units/period (P5-P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a stockout. Period 15 ended with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have a 4-period lead time, the OR Backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 98-100 units/period since Period 5, though the last few periods (P11-P15) show a slightly higher trend (~110). Using a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat will capture the stabilized regime from Period 5 onwards (average ~100), effectively setting a base stock around 500 units. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same stable regime (N=10) to account for recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 394) is currently below the likely required base stock (~500), thus the OR engine will place an order to bridge the gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P5-P15): Mean demand ~100 units/period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P14-P16) has significantly trended upwards (130, 123, 139), contrasting with the earlier lower regime (P7-P12). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 115.6 units, while the very recent 3-period average is 130.6. There is a clear recovery or seasonal increase in demand for regular chips. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 365 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this rising trend without over-reacting to the single highest peak (139). This provides a base_stock target based on roughly 116 units/period across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 115.6 (P12-P16) from the previous ~95-100 units/period regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently experiencing an upward trend. For the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the mean demand is 120.2 units/period, a significant increase from the previous regime (~95-100). The current in-transit inventory is 437 units, which matches the sum of orders from P14 (52), P15 (125), P16 (107), and P17 (153). Based on the consistent 4-period lead time, 52 units (P14 order) are expected to arrive during P18, followed by 125 units (P15 order) in P19. However, the store is currently at 0 on-hand inventory and has experienced stockouts for several consecutive periods (P13-P17). To maximize reward, I need to raise the target inventory to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge and high volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand environment while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: Mean demand increased to 120.2 units/period (P13-P17), up from ~98 units/period (P5-P14).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a higher regime, following a shift confirmed since Period 17. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 18 is 113.8 units/period. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1-P7, P10-P14). Currently, we are facing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 13), though arrivals have resumed. The pipeline inventory (in-transit: 531) includes orders from Periods 15 (125 units), 16 (107 units), 17 (153 units), and 18 (146 units). The order from Period 15 is expected to arrive during the current Period 19 resolution phase. To capture the recent demand level and maintain service levels while accounting for the established 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N demand statistics from the last 6 periods (P13-P18) to inform mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L parameter at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. After a confirmed upward shift peaking at Period 16 (139 units), demand has dropped significantly in the last three periods (107, 78, 66 units). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 105.8 units, while the mean over the last 3 periods is 83.6 units. Given this sharp decline following the peak, I will use a shorter window (N=5) to capture the recent cooling of demand while maintaining a buffer for the previous strength. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 59 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 441 units (covering nearly 4 periods of demand at recent rates), the focus is on stabilizing the base stock to prevent further stockouts while managing the high holding cost ($1.0), which equals the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: mean demand decreased to ~84 units/period over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) after a peak of 139 in P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant downward trend over the last 5 periods (P16-P20: 139, 107, 78, 66, 49). The average demand for the last 5 periods (N=5) is 87.8 units, compared to the previous regime of ~120 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (L=4), as confirmed by the P16 order arriving in P20. With an on-hand inventory of 117 and in-transit of 347 (Total 464), we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand level (approx 5 periods of demand covered by current inventory). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp decline and allow the OR backend to scale back ordering accordingly while accounting for the increased volatility during this drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: Demand has trended downwards for 5 consecutive periods (P16-P20), falling from 139 to 49. Mean demand for P16-P20 is 87.8 units/period (-27% vs previous regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-120.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the demand for chips(Regular) has significantly slowed down over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), moving from a peak of 139 units to a recent average of approximately 75 units/period (P18-P21: 78, 66, 49, 75). Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 75 units/period. The current inventory position is high, with 195 units on-hand and 194 units in-transit (orders from P18-P21), totaling 389 units. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent mean of 75, the base stock targets approximately 375 units (5 * 75). Since current inventory (389) already exceeds this forecast, and we prioritize minimizing holding costs which equal profit ($1/unit), I am setting the demand parameters to reflect the recent lower-demand regime using a 5-period window (N=5). This helps the OR backend target a lower pipeline inventory and avoid over-ordering during this softening phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has leveled at approximately 75 units/period over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean after a significant drop from the Period 16 peak (139). Over the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 82.6 units (107, 78, 66, 49, 75, 121), which is consistent with the carry-over insight of approximately 75-80 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (220) plus in-transit (48) totals 268 units. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. At a mean of ~82.6, total requirements are roughly 413 units (plus safety stock). However, holding costs are equal to profit margins ($1.0), so the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. This means we aim for the median demand. The system is currently slightly under-stocked relative to the 5-period requirement, but significant inventory (from Period 19-21 orders) is still in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect this stabilized lower regime, while maintaining L at the consistent actual lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P17-P22): Mean demand ~82.6 units/period, following the decline from the Period 16 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history reflects a period of volatility followed by a potential new spike. Period 23 saw a significant demand increase to 182 units, up from an average of ~81 units over the preceding four periods (P19-P22). This suggests a possible new demand regime or a seasonal outlier. The carry-over insights indicate a stable lead time of 4 periods, which remains consistent (P19 order arrived on P23). Current on-hand inventory is 73 units with 140 units in-transit (orders from P20 and P23). To account for the recent demand surge while acknowledging the previous lower-demand regime, I will use a recent_N window for both mean and variance. For mu_hat, N=7 (P17-P23) captures the transition from the low period (~75) through the recent spike (182), providing a balanced but responsive forecast for the 5-period horizon (L+1). For sigma_hat, N=7 captures the increased volatility introduced by the Period 23 jump, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for this uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 23 (182 units), significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~82 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory reached 0 because the small arrival from Period 20 (13 units) plus existing stock (73 units) was insufficient to meet the demand of 122. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. A significant demand spike (182 units) occurred in Period 23, followed by 122 in Period 24, suggesting a potential shift from the previous low-demand regime (~82 units/period). The last 3 periods (P22-P24) have averaged 141.6 units/period. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, to recover from the current stockout and potential upward demand shift, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during the spike.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift detected at Period 23: Mean demand for P22-P24 increased to ~142 units/period from the previous ~82 unit regime (+73%).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the demand environment for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a high-demand regime. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) has averaged 161 units (182, 122, 179), compared to the previous regime's average of ~82 units. This represents a significant upward shift. The Promised Lead Time is 4, and historical 'conclude' messages (P5-P24) consistently confirm an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of stockouts (P24-P25) due to the demand spike and a gap in arrivals (P21 and P22 orders were 0). Pipeline inventory is 524 units (orders from P23=127, P24=171, P25=226). To capture the new demand level and minimize lost sales while being cognizant of high holding costs ($1.0/unit), I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (last 4 samples, P22-P25). Given the recent volatility, N=4 provides a balanced reactive forecast for the backend OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed at Period 25: Mean demand increased from ~82 units to ~151 units (P22-P25 average), representing an ~84% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales in Periods 25 and 26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 23, with demand jumping from ~82 units to an average of 159.25 units over the last four periods (P23-P26: 182, 122, 179, 154). We are currently waiting for orders from Periods 21 and 22 (both 0 units) to 'arrive' (or rather, be bypassed) and the next substantive replenishment from Period 23 (127 units), which is expected during Period 27 (visible P28). To address the new high-demand regime and recover from the stockout, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand behavior of the last 4 periods (mean ~159, std ~26). This will raise the base stock level to cover (L+1)=5 periods of this higher demand. Using 'calculate' for L maintains the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P23-P26): Mean demand increased to 159.25 units/period, up from the previous ~82 units/period regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 23. The average demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) is approximately 162.2 units (182, 122, 179, 154, 174). This is a significant increase from the prior regime of ~82 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (174) exceeded the arrived shipment (127). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P23 order arriving exactly in P27. The in-transit pipeline (670 units) includes orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27. To maintain a high service level during this spike without excessive holding costs (given profit=$1 and holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (recent_N=5) and updating sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. L is maintained at the calculated average of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P23-P27) confirmed: Mean demand ~162 units/period, up from previous ~82 units (+97%). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-119.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand dropped significantly to 26 units from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~162). However, historical patterns for this SKU show high volatility and 'spiky' demand rather than a clean step-down. The 'In-transit' quantity (640 units) is robust, and the current high On-hand inventory (145) provides a buffer. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (equaling a 50% critical fractile), the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will use the most recent 6 periods (P23-P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window captures both the high-demand peak and the recent sharp drop, providing a balanced, albeit conservative, forecast (~139.5 units/period) to avoid over-ordering if the drop persists, while maintaining enough cover if demand rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 28: demand dropped to 26 units after a 5-period high-demand regime (avg ~162), suggesting either a regime end or a high-variance outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-279.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a dramatic shift. After a high-demand regime from Period 23 to 27 (averaging ~162 units/period), the last two periods (P28 and P29) have seen a sharp drop to 26 and 46 units respectively. This suggests a new low-demand regime or a significant volatile correction. On-hand inventory is currently high (325 units) after the arrival of a large order from Period 25. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand 325 + In-transit 414 = 739) is very substantial relative to the most recent demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in what appears to be a sudden downturn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P23-P29) to capture the high volatility and the recent decline, while lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend's service level logic will naturally reduce ordering given the high current stock and recent low demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased at Period 28: following a 5-period peak (avg ~162), demand dropped sharply to an average of 36 units over P28-P29, indicating a potential regime shift or post-peak slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-159.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has recently transitioned from a sustained high-demand regime (P23-P27, avg ~162) to an extremely volatile state (P28=26, P29=46, P30=187). The demand of 187 in Period 30 suggests the low numbers in P28-P29 might have been transient outliers or a temporary dip rather than a sustained low-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P23-P30) is approximately 117.6 units, while the mean of the last 3 periods (P28-P30) is 86.3 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (346 units) and in-transit (206 units), the current pipeline (552 units) is sufficient to cover about 4.7 periods even at the high-regime average (162). To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against another spike like P30, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=8) to smooth the recent volatility while accounting for the high P30 demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased after P27: following a 5-period peak (avg ~162), demand fluctuated wildly (26, 46, 187) between P28-P30, making the current regime mean difficult to pin down; staying with an 8-period window to capture both the peak and the recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-143.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P27 order arrived in P31). Demand has entered a high-volatility phase following a peak regime (P23-P27 avg ~162). Over the last 4 periods (P28-P31), demand has been 26, 46, 187, and 134, averaging 98.25 units. While the carry-over insight noted a potential slump, the rebound to 187 and 134 suggest that demand remains significant but highly variable. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P23-P31) for mu_hat to capture both the peak and the subsequent volatility, as this provides a balanced mean of approximately 134 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the increased variance observed in the most recent periods, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to handle this volatility without over-ordering excessively given the high inventory on hand (277) and in-transit (258).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after P27: mean demand for P23-P31 is ~134 units/period, with significant fluctuations (range 26-187). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-388.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of high volatility following a peak period (P23-P27). Recent demand figures (P28: 26, P29: 46, P30: 187, P31: 134, P32: 15) show no stable mean, with a wide range between 15 and 187 units. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), which captures both the peak and the subsequent volatility, the mean demand is ~122 units per period. Using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to capture this recent variance while preventing over-reaction to the extremely low demand of 15 units in P32. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is the promised value. With 403 units on-hand and 251 in-transit, there is significant inventory to cover the upcoming 5-period window (L+1), so the OR backend will likely order conservatively to manage holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme after Period 27: demand range [15, 187] with no stable mean. 10-period mean (P23-P32) is ~122 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility after the Period 23-27 peak (which averaged ~162 units/period). Demand in the last six periods (P28-P33) has been 26, 46, 187, 134, 15, and 86, resulting in a mean of ~82 units/period during this volatile slump. However, looking at the broader window since the volatility began (P23-P33), the average is ~118 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (317) and units in-transit (251), we are well-covered for the immediate future. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) to capture the full scope of this high-volatility regime (P23-P33) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the potential return of high demand while not over-ordering during the current erratic phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P27: Demand since P28 has oscillated between 15 and 187, with a 6-period average of ~82 units compared to the preceding 5-period peak of ~162 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility post-Period 27, with recent observations of 26, 46, 187, 134, 15, 86, and 123. The 7-period average since the spike ended is approximately 88 units/period, but the standard deviation is very high. On-hand inventory is currently high (194) and 277 units are in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32 as expected). Given the unpredictable demand swings, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and lower mean compared to the P23-P27 peak, while the OR backend's service-level logic (q = 0.5) will penalize overstocking. This helps normalize against the extreme low (15) and high (187) seen recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-51.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility post-Period 27, though recent samples (P33-P35: 86, 123, 130) suggest the mean is stabilizing somewhat around the long-term average of ~110-115 units/period. The extreme lows (15, 26, 46) and highs (182, 187) seen between P23-P32 appear to be part of a high-variance phase rather than a sustained shift to a 160+ mean. I am choosing a recent_N of 13 (covering P23-P35) to capture this entire volatile regime while balancing it against the most recent three periods of relative stability. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 181 and in-transit at 160 (Total 341), and an estimated 5-period demand (L+1) of approx 550-600 units, the system currently has a moderate deficit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods will help the OR backend account for the high variance while targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility after the high-demand peak (P23-P27). Recent demand (P28-P36) has fluctuated between 15 and 187 units, with the most recent observation being 27. The mean demand for the last 14 periods (P23-P36) is approximately 114 units, while the mean of the specifically volatile sequence (P28-P36) is approximately 84 units. Since on-hand inventory is currently high at 288 units and there are 244 units in-transit, there is a substantial buffer (total 532 units) against the 4-period lead time. To avoid further inventory accumulation during this low-demand swing while protecting against sudden spikes, I am using a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat (covering the volatile period P28-P36) and a slightly longer N of 14 for sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of recent variance. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P27: Demand from P28-P36 shows a mean of ~84 units/period with sharp fluctuations (range 15-187), down from the peak mean of ~162 units/period (P23-P27).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility post-Period 27, with values ranging from 15 to 187. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the mean demand is approximately 94.3 units/period, significantly lower than the preceding 5-period peak of ~162, but showing no stable convergence. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P32 order arriving in P36). The current on-hand inventory is 119, with 244 units in-transit (P34 order of 26 and P36 order of 218). To manage the high variance while acknowledging the lower recent mean, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent slump and spikes to prevent excessive stockouts or holding costs in this unpredictable phase. The backend will calculate the target base stock based on these samples and the lead time remains at the default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-145.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility post-Period 27, with the most recent demand being 0 following a high of 169. This 'sawtooth' pattern (high spikes followed by near-zero demand) makes a standard mean calculation for mu_hat unreliable. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P28-P38), the mean demand is approximately 80.3 units/period, which is consistent with the 'post-peak' average identified in Carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived P38). Given the high on-hand inventory (145) and substantial in-transit stock (327), and the zero demand last period, I will use a conservative recent_N approach. Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire volatile period since the last major regime shift, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for both the spikes and the lulls.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P27: mean demand for P28-P38 is ~80 units/period, characterized by high spikes (187, 169) and significant troughs (15, 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the Period 27 peak. Over the most recent 12-period window (P28-P39), mean demand is approximately 78.25 units/period, with a range of [0, 187]. Following a demand of 94 in P39 and 0 in P38, the current on-hand inventory is 51. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P31 order arriving in P35, P32 in P36, P34 in P38). Although the P33 order was 0 units, its window passed in P37, and the P34 arrival in P38 confirms the 4-period pipeline is functioning. With 327 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P38), we are well-covered for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak volatility and regime mean (~78), and a recent_N of 12 for sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation in this period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P28-P40) is characterized by extreme volatility with a mean of approximately 85.8 units/period, oscillating between 0 and 187. This is a significant drop from the peak observed during P23-P27 (~162 units). For Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 92 and in-transit is 164 (P38 order of 109 and P40 order of 55). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=13 (covering the volatile regime from P28 to P40) to capture this lower mean while maintaining enough safety stock for the high-variance spikes. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to reflect this heightened volatility. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P27: mean demand for P28-P40 is ~85.8 units/period, down from the peak mean of ~162 units/period (P23-P27). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the peak period (P23-P27). Since P28, demand has fluctuated between 0 and 187 units, with a mean of approximately 85.8 units per period through P40. The current demand in P41 was 88 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P36 order arriving in P40 (L=4). The in-transit inventory is high (366 units), but distributed over future arrivals. Given the extreme volatility and the recent stabilization of the mean around 85-90 units, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=14 (covering P28-P41) to capture this post-peak regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=14 to reflect the high variance observed in this period. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods throughout the history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the peak period at P27. Since P28, demand has fluctuated between 0 and 187 units, with a mean of approximately 83.5 units over the last 15 periods (P28-P42). Recent demand (P38-P42) has averaged 85.8 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving 4 periods after placement. On-hand inventory is currently low (43 units) while in-transit inventory is high (352 units), representing orders from P39 to P42. Given the high variance and the need to stabilize inventory against unpredictable spikes, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 425 (equivalent to an 85 unit/period forecast for L+1=5 periods) to match the post-peak mean, and using a recent_N window of 15 periods for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility observed since the regime shift at P28.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P28-P42) stabilized at a mean of ~83.5 units/period, with high variance (range 0-187). Lead time stability at 4 periods is confirmed across all observed deliveries.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a stockout (on-hand inventory = 0) following a demand spike of 150 units in Period 43. Current in-transit inventory is 382 units. Based on the consistent 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 40 (55 units) to arrive in Period 44, and the order from Period 41 (202 units) in Period 45. The demand since Period 28 has been highly volatile but has stabilized at a mean of approximately 83.5 units per period (P28-P42 range 0-187). To ensure coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods) given recent volatility and the current stockout, I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent mean (approx 85) while accounting for the high variance (sigma) observed in the recent volatile regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been remarkably stable at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $55.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the peak period around P23-P27. Since Period 28, the average demand has been approximately 86 units per period, with a range between 0 and 187. Over the last 15 periods (P28-P42), the mean demand (83.5) and significant variance suggest that a base stock policy should account for this persistent uncertainty. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 459 units in-transit. Given the high volatility but stabilized mean post-peak, I will use a recent_N window of 17 periods (covering P28 to the latest full sample) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current 'high-variance, moderate-mean' regime while excluding the older peak from P23-P27. The OR backend will use these values to manage the safety stock against the observed volatility while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-186.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late stage of the game (Period 46/50). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the Period 45 arrival (ordered P41, arrived P45). Demand since Period 28 has been highly volatile but has stabilized around a mean of ~83 units/period (P28-P45 mean is 82.8). The current on-hand inventory is 194, and pipeline inventory is 280 (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45 totaling 95+30+132+23=280). With only 5 periods remaining, we need to balance satisfying remaining volatile demand while avoiding excess inventory at Period 50. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=18 to cover the entire post-peak period from P28 onwards) to capture the current mean and high variance, and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-213.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current inventory state for chips(Regular) shows 251 units on-hand and 185 units in-transit. The demand regime remains highly volatile since Period 28, with a post-peak mean of approximately 83.5 units/period (P28-P46) and a wide range of [0, 187]. Recent demand has been lower (8, 38). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 decision periods remaining (47, 48, 49, 50), the order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur potential holding costs in the final accounting without contributing to units sold within the 50-period limit. Given the high on-hand inventory (251) relative to the recent average demand (~84), we already have enough stock to satisfy approximately 3 periods of demand. To maximize total reward and minimize ending inventory holding costs at the game's conclusion, I will set all parameters to reflect the current stable lead time and the post-peak demand mean, but the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering as the pipeline and on-hand inventory satisfy the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-75.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 48 of 50, meaning we only have 3 decision periods remaining (48, 49, 50). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any order placed today (Period 48) will arrive during Period 52's arrival phase, which is AFTER the game ends. Therefore, ordering more stock now is counterproductive as it will never arrive in time to satisfy demand and will only potentially incur holding costs if the backend OR logic fails to recognize the horizon. However, the OR engine requires parameters to calculate orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the stable post-peak regime (P28-P47) where mean demand is approximately 84 units/period with high variance. Given the proximity to the end of the game (L=4 is greater than the remaining 2 periods), orders placed now cannot arrive. I'll maintain 'default' methods for the backend while recognizing that on-hand (178) and in-transit (162) are more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods' demand without new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the game's end (Period 50). The current demand environment remains characterized by high volatility but has maintained a relatively stable mean of approximately 83.5 units/period since Period 28, with the last 5 periods (P44-P48) averaging 89.8 units despite a spike to 185 in P48. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only one ordering period left after this one (P50 is the conclusion), and on-hand inventory at 125 with 137 in-transit (reaching out to P52), our pipeline is likely sufficient. However, because the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=21 (P28-P48) to capture the stable but volatile post-peak regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the actual variance observed during this period. L will remain at 'default' (4).

Daily Profit: $67.00, Daily Holding Cost: $81.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility post-Period 27. Over the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is approximately 109 units/period, with a range between 8 and 185. The lead time is very stable at 4 periods, with the P45 order arriving exactly in P49. Currently, on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 309. To capture the recent variability and provide sufficient safety stock for the backend's base-stock calculation (where profit = holding cost, making the service level target 50%), I will use a 10-period lookback window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps incorporate the recent high-demand spikes (like 150 in P43 and 185 in P48) alongside lower periods. L remains at the default/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significant; mean demand for P40-P49 is 109.1 units/period, characterized by frequent spikes and troughs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
