{
  "rationale": "We are at Period_1 of 50. The initial on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be available for use at the start of Period 6. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the average demand is approximately 98.2 units per period. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 142 units, which is calculated using a base-stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) minus pipeline inventory, then capped. Since we have zero inventory and a long lead time, we need to build a pipeline immediately to cover the demand during the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods). 5 periods of average demand is approximately 491 units. The OR agent's 'capped' recommendation of 142 is very conservative for an initial order when starting from zero inventory, as it is likely limited by the smoothing cap (\u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + 1.645 * \u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L)). To avoid prolonged stockouts while waiting for the first delivery in Period 5, I will override the OR cap and place a larger order. I will order 500 units to establish a base stock that covers the 5-period window (L+1) at the historical average demand.",

Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and become visible to me at the start of Period 6. Currently, there is 500 units in-transit. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) yield a mean of approximately 98.2 units/period. Period 1 actual demand was 121, slightly above mean but within expected variance. 3. Strategy: The goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Total pipeline needed is ~98.2 * 5 = 491 units. Since I already have 500 units in-transit from Period 1, the pipeline is technically full according to current demand estimates. However, the OR recommendation suggests 104 units based on its statistical calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). 4. Adjustment: Since the first shipment won't arrive until Period 5 conclude (Period 6 start), I will face stockouts for the next few periods regardless of my action today.

No units will arrive in Period 29 (since no order was placed in Period 25), meaning a stockout in Period 29 is inevitable. Total In-Transit inventory is 351 units (P26: 151, P27: 50, P28: 150). \n3. **Demand Forecast**: The 'demand regime shift' recorded in Period 21 (avg ~53) was disrupted by significant spikes in Period 25 (189) and Period 28 (199). These spikes suggest a bi-modal or high-variance demand pattern rather than a simple low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 66 units.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 160 units aims to rebuild a buffer. To protect against the observed high-variance spikes (reaching ~200) while considering the lead time (L=4), we need a pipeline that covers demand for 5 periods (L+1).

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Confirmed actual lead time is 4 periods (as seen in Period 45: P41 order arrived). Orders placed now (P48) will arrive in P52, which is beyond the game end (P50). However, the system logic allows ordering for the terminal period. Existing in-transit inventory (101 units ordered in P44) is scheduled to arrive in P48's arrival phase (visible in P49), which will support demand for P49 and P50.\n\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: On-hand is 67. Demand over the last 3 periods has been consistently high (149, 159, 162). This matches the regime shift identified in P41. Remaining demand for P48, P49, and P50 is expected to avg 150/period (Total ~450 units).\n\n3. **Inventory Projection**: Current On-hand (67) + Expected Arrival from P44 (101) = 168 total units available for the remaining 3 periods. This leaves a significant deficit relative to expected demand (450 units).\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed in Period 48 with a 4-period lead time will not arrive in time to satisfy demand (ETA Period 52). However, OR recommends 183 units. Relying on the 168 units already in the pipeline (on-hand + P44 arrival) is the only way to satisfy demand before P50. Ordering more now will only increase holding costs for inventory that arrives after the game ends. I will set the action to 0 to maximize profit and minimize terminal holding costs.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current period is 49 of 50, meaning this is the final ordering opportunity that can reasonably impact fulfillment (ordered at P49, arrives at P53, but the game ends at P50). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. My current on-hand inventory is 109 units with 0 units in-transit. Looking at the demand history, we have transitioned from a low-demand regime (~50 units) to a high-variance, high-demand regime since Period 36, with frequent spikes reaching 190 units and a recent average around 110-150. Specifically, Period 48 demand was 59, but the three periods prior were 149, 159, and 162. Since Period 50 is the final period, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy any demand. However, to fulfill the objective of making a decision for Period 49, I evaluate the inventory needed for the remaining horizon. As the lead time is 4, an order placed now arrives in Period 53. Since the game ends at Period 50, and 109 units on-hand is likely sufficient to cover the final period (P49 demand resolved after this decision, P50 demand), no further orders are logical. I will set the action to 0 to avoid holding costs on inventory that won't arrive before the game ends.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time analysis: Confirmed at 4 periods (Period 44 order arrived at Period 48 conclude). Current Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. All shipments have been fulfilled. Demand analysis: The current regime (Period 36-49) shows high volatility with a mean of ~110 units and spikes up to 197 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (45-49) averaged 155 units. Strategy: The total pipeline must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Since on-hand and in-transit are both zero, a significant order is required. The OR recommendation of 183 units is insufficient to cover 5 periods of a ~110-150 unit demand regime. Calculated requirement: 5 periods * 130 (conservative mean) = 650 units. However, I am constrained by the OR cap logic (safety factor) and should avoid over-ordering at the end of the simulation. I will override the OR recommendation of 183 units and place a larger order of 400 units to partially replenish the empty pipeline and mitigate the high risk of continued stockouts, while remaining mindful of holding costs for any remaining periods.",
