Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data and no inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the sequence of demand resolution happens after the decision phase, we must ensure the 'base stock' covers at least (L+1) periods of demand. Based on the 5 pre-game demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the mean is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 26.3. Since there are only 5 samples and no prior trend information, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat for the (L+1) horizon. I will also use the 'default' lead time (4 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 142 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning this order is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 142 units in transit. Since we only have 5 historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the average demand is approximately 98.2 per period. With a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 98.2 = 491. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and subtract the 142 in-transit units to determine the new order. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level (q) is high (~95%), which is appropriate for chips. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent history which shows some volatility (ranging from 60 to 122).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 (142 units each, totaling 284 in-transit) are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales. Demand in the first two periods was 121 and 87. Historical data provided (Periods 1-5) shows demand of 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. Note: The history in the prompt's 'GAME HISTORY' for Period 1-2 shows demand 121 and 87, while the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section lists 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. I will prioritize the most recent observed samples from the game history (121, 87) and the provided list to estimate mean demand. Average demand is around 100. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Base stock should be around 500 units. Since 284 are in-transit, the OR engine will order approximately 216 units to reach that level. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma to capture the initial demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (N=1) with L=4 arrives during Period 5 (N+L) and becomes observable at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the fact that 'arrived=0' in the conclusions for Periods 1, 2, and 3 is expected behavior. My current inventory position is 0 on-hand and 417 in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable but shows a slight downward trend (121, 87, 96). With only 3 periods of observed outcome and 5 total historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the sample size is small. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent mean (approx 98 units per period) and default lead time settings. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which is essential as we are currently stock-out and waiting for the first delivery in Period 5.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this period), and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message seen at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, logic consistent with the lead time. Demand over the first four periods has been [121, 87, 96, 86], significantly lower than the sample data provided in the prompt [122, 121, 60, 83, 105]. Given this downward shift in demand (average ~97.5 vs ~98.2), I will use the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect the local demand environment. I will stick with the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2658.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of Period 5's arrival confirms the actual lead time is indeed 4 (Ordered P1, arrived P5). Current demand samples (Period 1 to 5) are: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140. Average demand is 106. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (1+L) = 5 periods. Total expected demand over the lead time is 5 * 106 = 530. Pipeline inventory is currently 406 (Orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). On-hand is 2. Total position is 408. To reach the base stock target and account for the slightly higher recent demand (140 in P5), I'll use a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stay responsive to potential upward trends while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1516.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: Period 5 saw the arrival of the Period 1 order (lead_time = 4), and Period 6 saw the arrival of the Period 2 order (lead_time = 4). This confirms the actual lead time is currently stable at 4 periods. In terms of demand, we have 6 samples (Period 1-6): 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83. The mean is approximately 102.1 units with significant variance (std ~23.5). The stockout in Period 1-4 was caused by 0 starting inventory, not necessarily a shortage of supply relative to demand once arrivals began. Currently, on-hand (61) + in-transit (409) = 470 units. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent demand variability including the spike in Period 5, and use the default lead time (4) as it is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals matched P1 and P2 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1346.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (all arriving exactly after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 117, and there are 386 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods from orders placed in Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7). Historical demand since the start of the game (Periods 1-7) shows a mean of approximately 98.6 units (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77). Including the pre-game samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the overall average is roughly 98.4 units. I will set L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is accurate. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'default' (all samples) to capture the full distribution, which provides a stable baseline for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' to ensure the inventory buffer accounts for the observed volatility (standard deviation across all 12 samples is ~21). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), which justifies a high service level (0.95), handled by the OR backend.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the last 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 102 units with moderate volatility (std \u2248 24). In-transit inventory stands at 338 units, consisting of orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8, which are expected to arrive in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 115. To maintain the service level while accounting for the target cycle (L+1 = 5 periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the full range of observed variability while respecting the established lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1818.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 25 units. Arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-5 have concluded, confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable with a mean around 101.5. However, there was a high demand of 140 in Period 5 and 126 in Period 8. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5-9) to capture the most recent demand behavior, which averages 104.6 units per period. Since L=4, the review plus lead time period is (1+L)=5. The OR backend will compute mu_hat as 5 * 104.6 = 523. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 472 units covers orders from Periods 6-9. With L=4, the system is performing as expected with the promised lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10 matching orders from Periods 1 through 6. Current demand is stable; the mean demand across the first 10 periods is 101.5 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods) is 97 units per period, while the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) average 108.3. Given the lack of a significant trend or calendar events (no fiscal dates provided), I will use recent history to capture current volatility. Current on-hand (68) and in-transit (454) total 522 units. With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use N=5 for both mean and variance to balance responsiveness with stability. This will set a base stock roughly around 500-600 units (5 * ~100 mean + safety stock), which aligns well with our current inventory position, ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11 (all orders from Periods 1-7 arrived with a lead_time of 4). Demand data for the last 11 periods shows relative stability with a mean around 103 units, though recent samples (Periods 9-11) suggest a slight uptick (mean ~104) compared to the mid-game slump. On-hand inventory is 64, with 378 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). For Period 12, I'll use the promised lead time of 4. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). To capture recent demand trends while maintaining stability, I'll use the last 10 samples (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the most relevant operational window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is showing consistent demand and lead-time behavior. History confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (validated from arrivals in Periods 5-12). Historical demand from the initial training data (Periods 1-5: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) and recent game history (Periods 1-12: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126, 97, 102, 114, 90) shows a mean demand around 102 units with moderate variance. Currently, we have 50 units on-hand and 437 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Order P9 (141 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P13). Setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 captures the realized demand pattern since the start of the game, helping the OR backend maintain a stable service level without over-ordering.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 5 through Period 13 consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Consequently, L is set to 4 (default). Demand analysis shows a fairly stable pattern. The original 5 samples provided in the instructions (Mean: 98.2, Std: 26.6) and the subsequent 13 periods of in-game history (Mean: 102.5, Std: 18.0) show no significant regime shifts or seasonal trends. The combined average demand across all 18 samples is approximately 101.3 units per period. Since the demand is stable and consistent, I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the full breadth of available data for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the target service level against holding costs based on the profit margin ($19/$1). Total inventory (On-hand: 80 + In-transit: 389 = 469) is currently aligned with covering 4-5 periods of demand (~505 units).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals from Period 5 through 14. Current on-hand inventory is 112 units, with 375 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 are expected in P15, P16, P17, and P18 respectively). Historical demand over the last 14 periods shows relative stability with a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of about 18 units. There is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend in the 'Regular Chips' category based on the limited data. Therefore, using the default calculation based on all historical samples (which includes the provided Period 1-5 seeds and the subsequent 14 periods of game history) is appropriate to set the base stock level (L+1 demand) to cover the 5-period risk horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1134.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P5-P15 all show lead_time=4). There are no signs of lost shipments. Regarding demand, the mean of the samples provided in history (P1-P15) and the 5 pre-game samples (P1-P5 provided separately) are consistently around 100 units. Since P1, the average demand is roughly 101.4 units. There is no evidence of a significant regime shift or seasonal spike in 'chips(Regular)' at Period 16. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the most recent stable demand regime observed across the concluded game history, covering roughly 3 lead-time cycles (5 periods each), which balances responsiveness with stability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized over the last 16 periods. Analyzing the recent demand (Periods 11-16), the average is approximately 91 units per period. The historical data (Periods 1-5) provided in the instructions showed slightly higher but more volatile values, whereas the game history shows a steady mean. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders (Orders from Periods 1-12 have all arrived exactly at Period N+4). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 125 units, and there are 354 units in transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the consistent demand pattern seen throughout the game history, which excludes the initial seed data outliers. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $522.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent decrease, with the latest observation (Period 17) being 37 units, significantly lower than the previous average of approx 100. This could be a transient dip or a new regime. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the mean demand is 79.8 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 5 through 17. Inventory management: On-hand is 181, which is over 4 units of current demand. Pipeline (in-transit) is 333 (comprised of orders from P14-P17: 113, 91, 57, 72). Total coverage is 514 units. To reflect the recent lower demand and prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level (z* approx 2.0 based on $19 profit/$1 holding), I will use a recent_N approach. I'll set N=7 for demand to capture the recent cooling trend without overreacting to the single P17 data point.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 18. Current demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with no significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes detected in the recent history (Periods 13-18). Demand mean over these last 6 periods is approximately 71.5 units, which is lower than the long-term average, suggesting a slight cooling trend. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current demand environment while keeping the Lead Time (L) at the promised/confirmed value of 4. On-hand inventory (202) plus In-transit (237) equals 439 units, which covers over 6 periods of current average demand, indicating a healthy stock position to mitigate stockout risks without excessive holding costs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 19. Demand has recently showed signs of a potential downward shift, specifically in Period 17 (37 units) and Period 19 (5 units), although the volatility remains significant. Given the high on-hand inventory (288 units) and in-transit units (215), the current state is overstocked relative to the observed demand of the last 10 periods (avg ~78 units). To avoid increasing holding costs while managing this high inventory, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for demand estimation. I'll set N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower demand outcomes while acknowledging the high variance, allowing the OR backend's capped policy to naturally reduce orders until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 16, with significantly lower demand observations in Period 17 (37) and Period 19 (5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift and increased volatility starting around Period 17. The mean demand for the first 16 periods was approximately 97 units, whereas the mean for the last 5 periods (Periods 16-20) has dropped to 52.8 units (92, 37, 92, 5, 40). Specifically, Periods 17, 19, and 20 showed very low demand (37, 5, 40). Given the current high inventory levels (On-hand: 305, In-transit: 185) relative to this lower demand, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime and prevent further overstocking. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Mean demand dropped from ~97 to ~53 units per period; volatility increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Analyzing the demand history, a clear regime shift occurred at Period 17. From Periods 1 to 16, demand averaged ~98 units. Since Period 17, the demand has dropped significantly, with observations of 37, 92, 5, 40, and 37 (averaging ~42 units). This shift was noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, we have 340 units on-hand and 113 in-transit. Given the lower demand and a lead time of 4 periods, our inventory position is very high relative to expected demand (total stock covers roughly 10 periods of current average demand). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 21 (Order from P17 arrived in P21). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture only the post-shift demand regime (Periods 17-21), allowing the OR backend to adjust its target stock level downwards to reflect the lower demand and avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $543.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 17. From Periods 17 to 22, demand values were 37, 92, 5, 40, 37, and 45, averaging ~42.6 units. This is significantly lower than the pre-Period 17 average of ~97. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 312, In-transit: 96) are very high relative to the new demand level (total of 408 units vs. ~42.6 demand/period). The base stock calculation for L=4 (covering 5 periods) at the current demand rate would be approximately 42.6 * 5 = 213 units. Since we have 408 units in the pipeline/on-hand, we are significantly overstocked. Setting parameters to reflect the lower demand (recent_N=6) to allow the OR backend to naturally decrease order volume and minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 sustained: mean decreased from ~97 to ~43 (-55%) over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-121.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 is now firmly established over 7 periods (P17-P23), showing a significant drop in mean demand. The mean demand for these 7 periods is approximately 38.4 units (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13), compared to the pre-P17 mean of approximately 97.4. Currently, the on-hand inventory (368 units) is extremely high relative to this new demand level, covering over 9 periods of expected demand. In-transit inventory is 27 units (ordered P20). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the lower demand environment, I will maintain parameters that reflect the recent demand regime to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs, while the OR backend naturally suppresses orders due to the high pipeline inventory. I use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture only the post-shift performance and confirm the new lower-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $485.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17. Looking at the last 8 periods (P17-P24), the mean demand has dropped to approximately 39.1 units per period (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13, 44), compared to the ~100 units seen earlier. Furthermore, demand in the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is even lower, averaging 34.75 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 351 units with zero in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand would be approximately 175-200 units. Our current on-hand inventory (351) is already nearly double that requirement. To minimize holding costs and prevent further inventory bloating, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime and use the default calculation for lead time, as it has consistently remained at 4 periods. No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the high current inventory relative to the lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 stabilized: Mean demand for P17-P24 (8 periods) is ~39 units (-60% from baseline). High on-hand inventory relative to lower demand will require several periods of depletion before new orders are justified.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3429.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we observed a significant demand spike of 189 units, which is a stark departure from the low-demand regime (~39 units/period) observed from Period 17-24. While this could be a one-time outlier, it has successfully reduced our excessive on-hand inventory from 351 to 162. With 0 units currently in-transit, our total inventory coverage is solely this on-hand balance. Based on the previous high-demand regime average (~100 units/period) and the recent spike, 162 units cover less than 2 periods of high demand, posing a stockout risk given the 4-period lead time. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=9 to weigh the recent low-demand regime against this new spike, effectively raising the target stock level to trigger stabilization orders if demand remains elevated. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 25: 189 units. This potentially signals the end of the low-demand regime (P17-P24) and a return to higher volatility or a new high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $618.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a transition from a low-demand regime (avg ~39 from P17-P24) back into a high-volatility phase. Period 25 saw a massive spike (189), followed by a return to moderate demand (39 in P26). Given this inconsistency, I need to balance the risk of another spike with the existing on-hand (123) and in-transit (148) inventory. The in-transit order from P26 (148) is expected to arrive in P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to incorporate both the low-demand trough and the recent P25 spike, as the product is currently exiting a stagnant phase. This provides a weighted average that is more responsive than the long-term mean but more stable than reacting solely to the P25 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the increased variance observed in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime instability: P25 saw a 384% increase relative to the P17-P24 average, but P26 returned to 39. This suggests the low-demand regime has ended, but a new stable mean is not yet established.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be highly volatile and difficult to characterize following the end of the stable low-demand period (P17-P24). We saw a massive spike in P25 (189), followed by a return to low levels in P26 (39) and P27 (16). Given this extreme variance, the 'recent_N' approach with a small window (N=3) allows the OR engine to react to this new volatility while capturing the fact that average demand remains lower than the P1-P16 baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 107 and in-transit is 289, totaling 396 units. With an estimated average demand of ~81 units per period (last 3 periods average) and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline is roughly (4+1)*81 = 405. The current positions are nearly balanced, but given the spike in P25, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the most recent 3 periods to catch any emerging trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment is showing extreme volatility and potential spikes. Period 28 saw a massive demand spike of 199 units (following a spike of 189 in Period 25), which completely depleted the 107 units on-hand. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. While 525 units are in-transit, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 26 (148 units) will not arrive until Period 30 conclude (visible P31). We are entering a period of stockouts. The demand pattern from P25-P28 (189, 39, 16, 199) suggests a highly volatile regime with a mean of ~111. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new volatility and higher mean compared to the previous low-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistent since Period 5. This strategy aims to rebuild inventory to cover these new high-demand spikes while balancing the service level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 25: Characterized by extreme volatility with frequent high-demand spikes (~190-200 units) interspersed with low demand, resulting in a significantly higher mean (~111) compared to the P17-P24 period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 25. The previous low-demand period (P17-P24, avg ~39) has been replaced by a high-volatility regime with significant spikes (189 in P25, 199 in P28, 136 in P29). Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the mean demand is 115.8. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is operating with a 4-period lead time. Shipments from P21-P24 were zero, causing the stockout. The pipeline inventory (795 units ordered from P26-P29) is substantial, but none will arrive until P30 (from P26 order) or later. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-mean regime (P25-P29). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime confirmed starting Period 25: Mean increased to ~116 (from ~39 in previous regime) with frequent spikes near 200 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting at Period 25, characterized by extreme spikes (up to 199 units) and low periods. The mean demand for the most recent 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 98.67 units, with a very high standard deviation. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the Period 30 arrival of the Period 26 order. Currently, on-hand inventory is 135 units, but there is a significant pipeline of 742 units (ordered between P27-P30) which will begin arriving in Period 31. Because the pipeline is so large relative to the current demand mean, the OR backend's capped policy will likely limit additional orders. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this high-volatility regime while maintaining the calculate method for lead time to ensure stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2164.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 25 into a high-volatility state. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has been: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122. The mean for this new regime is ~102. The variance has increased significantly due to frequent spikes near 200 units and drops near 15 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand is 154 and in-transit is 601 (from orders in P28, P29, P30), totaling 755 units. Given the lead time of 4, our 'at-risk' period is 5 periods. A mean demand of ~102 over 5 periods is ~510. With high volatility, our current pipeline (755) is sufficient to cover demand while we wait for the P28 shipment (236 units) to arrive in Period 32. No new order is likely needed this period as total inventory exceeds expected demand + safety buffer for the next 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime confirmed since Period 25: Mean ~102 units with extreme variance (range 13-199).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 25 into a high-volatility pattern with frequent spikes (~200 units) and occasional low values, as noted in carry-over insights. The mean demand since P25 (8 periods: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122, 55) is 96.1 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (335) and there is a significant pipeline (413), totaling 748 units. However, given the promised lead time of 4 (requiring 5 periods of demand coverage) and the extreme volatility (stdev is ~72 since P25), the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to protect against the 200-unit spikes. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime and set L to calculate to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 25 to a high-volatility pattern with a mean demand of approximately 102 units (calculated from P25 to P33). This replaces the low-demand regime seen between P17-P24 (~39 units). However, the system is currently overstocked with 588 units on-hand and an additional 153 units in-transit. With an average demand of ~102, the current inventory levels cover over 7 periods of future demand, which exceeds the required protection levels for a 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed for several periods. To minimize further ordering and allow for inventory depletion while the OR backend still calculates against perceived demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (the full extent of the new regime) and maintaining L at the calculate/default level of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is characterized by high volatility but has shown a decelerating mean over the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34: 13, 122, 55, 17, 56; Mean ~53), compared to the earlier spike-heavy phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high (627 units), which is approximately 6-12 periods of supply even under high-demand assumptions. With an additional 58 units in-transit, the current total pipeline of 685 units is more than sufficient to cover the promised lead time of 4 periods plus reviewing period. The holding cost of $1.0 is significant relative to the inventory level. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10 periods (covering the transition and the current volatile phase) to provide the OR backend with a realistic view of the current regime's volatility and mean, which will likely result in zero orders until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since P25, but the 5-period rolling average has moderated to ~53 units (P30-P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25, characterized by sharp spikes (up to 199) and deep troughs (as low as 13). The most recent 11-period regime (P25-P35) has an average demand of approximately 87 units, but the last 5 periods have averaged significantly lower (~53 units). Given the current on-hand inventory of 611 units and an in-transit pipeline of 58 units, the total inventory position (669) covers over 12 periods of demand at the lower recent average (53) or ~7.7 periods at the regime average (87). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full volatility of the current regime starting at P25, which will provide a conservative but realistic demand distribution (mu_hat and sigma_hat) for the OR engine. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the backend due to the high inventory ceiling.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as documented in the insights since Period 25. Most recently, Period 36 saw a spike of 187 units, following a quieter Period 35 (16 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 472 units, which is ample given the recent 5-period average demand of approximately 67 units (P32-P36). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (roughly (4+1)*67 = 335), I will continue to set parameters that prevent excessive ordering while the backend handles the depletion. I'll use the recent 12-period window (P25-P36) to capture the current high-volatility regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1738.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is characterized by extreme volatility and high-amplitude spikes (ranging from 13 to 199). While the mean demand over this period (P25-P37) is approximately 87 units, the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) have shown high variance with a mean of 97.4 units. I will use a recent_N window of 13 periods (from Period 25 onwards) to capture this high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Currently, the system has a high inventory position: 371 on-hand plus 210 in-transit (total 581). Given the current total inventory and a lead time of 4, the base stock levels calculated by the backend should naturally lead to zero or minimal ordering until the surplus is depleted. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals have consistently confirmed the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime (P25-P37) mean ~87, characterized by frequent spikes near 200 units and troughs near 15 units. Significant inventory surplus currently on-hand (371 units) relative to recent mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3209.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 25), with Period 38 seeing another significant spike to 179 units. The mean demand since Period 25 is approximately 92.4 units, but with a high standard deviation. The on-hand inventory is 192, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 338, totaling 530 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and extremely high volatility, we need to maintain a robust base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). However, since we are currently holding significant inventory across on-hand and pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-volatility regime (N=14, spanning P25-P38) to ensure the OR backend captures this increased risk of spikes while avoiding excessive over-ordering. L remains at the stable 4-period mark observed throughout history.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime (P25-P38) mean is ~92 units, with frequent spikes (179-199) and troughs (13-17). Variance remains significantly higher than the initial baseline regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3648.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting at Period 25, characterized by frequent spikes near 200 units (e.g., P36: 187, P38: 179, P39: 197). Over the most recent 15 periods (P25-P39), the average demand is approximately 98 units with high variance. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, while 554 units are in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39). Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods since early observations. Given that the current inventory is exhausted and we are facing high-demand spikes, I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean (~98) and high volatility of this current regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New high-volatility demand regime confirmed (P25-P39): Mean demand is ~98 units with frequent spikes near 200, representing a significant shift from the previous low-demand period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25, characterized by high-demand spikes (near 200 units) and low troughs. As of Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 0 due to 192 units sold in Period 39 against a demand of 197, and 0 sales in Period 40 due to stockout. However, the in-transit inventory is very high at 780 units, reflecting aggressive ordering in Periods 37-40 (210, 128, 216, 226 units). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, no arrival occurred in Period 40 (consistent with the order gap in Period 36). Arrivals are expected to resume in Period 41 (the 210 units ordered in Period 37). The current demand regime (P25-P40) has a mean of approximately 96.5 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture this entire high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock accounts for the recent average and the high variance. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4) as it has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25, characterized by spikes near 200 units and sharp drops below 20. The mean demand for the current high-volatility regime (P25-P41) is approximately 93 units. Period 41 demand was very low (8 units), which is consistent with this regime's behavior. We are currently in Period 42. On-hand inventory is 202, but there is 570 units in-transit (ordered in P38, P39, P40). Specifically, the order from P38 (128 units) is expected to arrive in Period 42 (visible in P43 conclude) and the order from P39 (216 units) in Period 43 (visible in P44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Because the total pipeline (inventory + in-transit) is 772 units, which is far above the required base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 5*93=465), the OR backend will correctly suppress new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the full scope of this volatile regime (P25-P41) for better mean and standard deviation estimation, helping the backend navigate the spikes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 25, characterized by spikes near 200 and troughs below 20. The current mean since Period 25 is approximately 96 units, though recent demand has been lower (8 and 19 in P41 and P42). On-hand inventory is 311, and In-transit is 442 (from orders in P39 and P40), totaling 753 units. Given the high carry-over from P39 and P40 orders arriving in P43 and P44, the current pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 7-8 periods of mean demand. No new order is needed this period as total inventory exceeds the target for a 4-period lead time. I will maintain lead time at the stable 4-period mark and use the recent N (N=18, since P25) to capture the high-volatility regime mean (~96) and variance, which the OR backend will use to calculate the base stock and conclude no order is required due to the pipeline surplus.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand since Period 25 represents a high-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 94 units and extreme spikes alternating with troughs. Current inventory (on-hand 335 + in-transit 226 = 561) is high relative to the mean demand and the four periods remaining until the game end (P44-P50). Since lead time is 4, an order placed now (P44) arrives in P48. With only 6 periods total remaining and substantial pipeline inventory, the primary goal is to avoid excess holding costs while covering the remaining volatility. I will use the mean and standard deviation from the current high-volatility regime (P25-P43, N=19) to set parameters.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is characterized by extreme volatility with spikes near 200 and troughs near 1. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility period (P25-P44) is approximately 85.5 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (560 units) due to a recent arrival of 226 units combined with extremely low demand in Period 44 (1 unit). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 758 units. Given the mean demand of ~86, this covers roughly 8.8 periods of demand. With 6 periods remaining in the game (P45-P50), the system is overstocked. To maximize reward, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20 to capture the start of the volatile regime) which will result in no new orders being placed by the OR backend, allowing inventory to deplete and minimizing further holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime (P25-P44): mean ~86 units, range 1-199. Inventory surplus (758 total) is sufficient to cover the remaining game periods.

Currently, the game is at Period 46 with only 5 periods remaining (including the current one). The total inventory position is 609 units (411 on-hand + 198 in-transit arriving in Period 48). Even if demand were at its maximum historical spike of ~200 units every single remaining period, the current total inventory would be sufficient to cover the rest of the game (609 units vs potentially 800-1000 units of demand, but given the mean is ~86, actual expected demand is ~430). Since the holding cost is $1.0 vs a unit profit of $19.0, and the game is ending soon, any additional orders would likely only result in ending inventory charges. I will maintain lead time L at the confirmed value of 4 periods and use the high-volatility regime (P25-P45, N=21) to calculate demand stats, though the OR backend's cap and inventory position will naturally prevent further ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 47 of 50). The current demand regime (since Period 25) is characterized by extreme volatility (mean ~90, range 1-200). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, an order placed today (P47) would arrive in Period 51, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to manage existing inventory and late-arriving in-transit units to maximize profit and minimize holding costs for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Current total inventory (On-hand: 252 + In-transit: 338 = 590) is far more than enough to cover the expected demand for the last 4 periods (approx 360 units based on regime mean). Additional orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. To prevent the OR backend from placing further orders, I am setting an explicit lead time and very low demand parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level remains below the current pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2988.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are near the end of the simulation (Game Day 48/50). Current inventory levels are: On-hand = 90, In-transit = 338 (orders from P44: 198, P46: 140). The demand regime since P25 has been highly volatile (mean ~87, range 1-199). With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is outside the simulation window (ends at P50). Our goal is to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50) while minimizing ending inventory. The expected total demand for these 3 periods is approximately 261 units (based on the P25-P47 mean of ~87/period). Our total available units (On-hand + In-transit) are 428 units. Even if the P46 order (140 units) arrives in P50 (lead time 4), we already have 90 (on-hand) + 198 (arriving P48 resolution phase) = 288 units available to satisfy P48, P49, and P50 demand. This is likely sufficient. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that will not arrive in time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with only two periods left in the game (P49 and P50). The primary goal now is to avoid unnecessary holding costs while ensuring enough inventory is available to satisfy demand for the final two periods. Current On-hand inventory is 229 units. Total In-transit is 363 units (ordered in P46 and P48). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P49) would not arrive until after the game concludes (P53). Similarly, the 363 units in-transit will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, the only usable inventory for the remainder of the game is the current on-hand stock of 229 units. Since the current demand regime (P25-P48) has a mean of approximately 85 units per period and a maximum observed demand of 199, the 229 units currently on-hand are highly likely to cover the demand for P49 and P50. Any further ordering would only serve to increase the pipeline inventory with no benefit to sales. I will set the parameters to effectively stop ordering by utilizing the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a value low enough that base stock will not exceed current inventory levels.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final period of the game. Total inventory (On-hand: 85 + In-transit: 363 = 448 units) is more than sufficient to cover the demand for this final period, even considering the high-volatility regime where demand spikes reach ~200 units. Since any order placed now (Period 50) would arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time) and the game ends after Period 50, placing an order would only incur unnecessary lead-time pipeline accounting without any possibility of generating profit or satisfying demand. Therefore, the goal is to set the OR parameters to result in a zero order while maintaining a robust statistical profile for the current regime (P25-P49). Lead time L is set to calculated (consistent 4 periods). Mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 25 samples (N=25) to capture the high-volatility regime that started at Period 25.
