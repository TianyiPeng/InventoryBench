Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical performance or concluding messages yet. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 provided in context: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) show an average of 98.2. Since the first period decision happens before the period 1 demand is resolved in the game sequence, and we have no stock on hand, we need to establish a base stock level. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full set of provided demand samples and the promised lead time. The OR engine will target a service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q = 0.8), ensuring sufficient inventory to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 142 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Demand in Period 1 was 122 and Period 2 (which we just saw concluded) was 121 (Note: the user prompt says Period 1 conclude demand was 121, but historical demand list says P1=122, P2=121). Since on-hand inventory was 0, those were lost sales. We have 5 historical samples: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The average is 98.2. Since there is no clear trend or calendar information yet, I will use a conservative approach using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to encompass all available samples. Using N=5 for both mean and sigma provides a balanced estimate given the initial volatility (60 to 122). L is set to default as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (142 units) and Period 2 (142 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 284 units. Since L=4, the first order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but this is expected given the lead time. Demand in the first two periods was 121 and 87, with historical samples showing values like 122, 121, 60, 83, and 105. The average demand across these 5 samples is approximately 98.2. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the backend to use all available historical data (5 samples), which is appropriate given the relatively stable but limited history. L is set to 'default' (4) as we have seen no 'conclude' messages to suggest any deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Consequently, there have been 0 arrivals to date, resulting in 0 units sold and 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit quantity is 424 units (142 from P1 + 142 from P2 + 140 from P3). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data) shows values of 122, 121, 60, 83, and 105. The average demand across these 5 samples is 98.2. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) must cover demand for L+1 periods (4+1=5), and our current pipeline (424) is slightly below 5 periods of average demand (approx 491), I will maintain the default lead time and use a recent_N window of 5 for demand estimation to capture the volatility observed in the early periods (ranging from 60 to 122).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival resolution and is first visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which we will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observed at the start of Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 is expected behavior. The first delivery is expected to hit the shelves after our current decision. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 521 in-transit (sum of orders from P1-P4: 142+142+140+97=521). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including current context data: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) averages approximately 98.2 units per period with moderate variance. Since there is no evidence yet that the lead time is different from the promised 4 periods, I will stick to the default L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the 'default' methods will correctly utilize all available demand samples to calculate the base stock level (1+L) * mean across the lead time plus review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Historical demand for the 5 concluded periods is [121, 87, 96, 86, 140]. The average demand is 106 units/period. On-hand inventory is low (2 units) because the Period 5 demand (140) consumed almost all of the 142 units that arrived. There are 388 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of 106, the required base stock is roughly 530 units. We currently have 2 on-hand + 388 in-transit = 390 units. The OR backend will place an order to bridge the gap to the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior, and 'default' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (samples provided + history) shows values of {122, 121, 60, 83, 105} in samples and {121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83} in the game history. Averaging the available game history demand (Periods 1-6), we get roughly 98.8 units per period. The inventory state is: On-hand = 61, In-transit = 391. Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly with a lead time of 4. We are awaiting orders from Period 3 (140 units), Period 4 (97 units), Period 5 (9 units), and Period 6 (145 units). Given the consistent 4-period lead time, the Period 3 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 7. For the OR backend, I will use 'default' for L to match the observed stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the recent historical demand variability and mean accurately, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand over the first 7 periods has been: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77. The average demand is approximately 98.57 units per period. The pipeline (In-transit) is 354 units, consisting of orders from P4 (97), P5 (9), P6 (145), and P7 (103). Given L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~493 units. On-hand (124) + In-transit (354) = 478. The backend OR logic will determine the order based on the base stock minus pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full observed demand history, as there is no clear regime shift yet, just natural variance. I'll use 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the lead time is stable and the default standard deviation calculation over the history is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $409.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-4. The mean demand over the first 8 periods is 102 units, but there is noticeable variance (Std Dev \u2248 23). Current status: On-hand = 95, In-transit = 316 (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Total pipeline inventory is 411. Since we have a stable lead time and consistent demand data without clear shifts or seasonality yet, I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage observed lead times and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data (8 periods of game history + 5 pre-game samples). This ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock level over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) to cover expected demand and volatility while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously identified (confirmed by arrivals for orders from P1-P5). Demand over the last 9 periods has averaged approximately 101.4 units (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126, 97). Adding the pre-game samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the overall mean is around 98.9. Current on-hand inventory is low (7 units) while in-transit is high (444 units). Since the lead time L=4 is stable and demand shows moderate variance without a clear trend or regime shift, I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the backend to utilize all available historical data to compute the base stock, ensuring we cover the 5 periods (L+1) required to maintain service levels while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory currently in transit.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. Calculating the mean demand from the 10 samples (excluding the seed data to focus on the active game history), the average demand is approximately 101 units per period (sum=1015). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in all arrivals from P5 to P10). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 50 units and 393 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Given L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average of 101, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period is ~505. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 443. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the parameters provided. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the specific demand characteristics of the game history, and set L to 'calculate' as the lead time has been stable and predictable.

The initial five samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) provided in the data set had a mean of 98.2. Period 1-4 demand observed in the game was 121, 87, 96, 86. The demand is relatively stable across the history with a global mean around 100. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11. Current on-hand is low (39) and in-transit is 394 (representing orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since (1+L) equals 5 periods, the target pipeline should cover demand for 5 periods (~500 units). I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) of demand to calculate mu_hat to capture the most recent stability, and default for others given the lead time reliability.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 8 units. Reviewing the lead time history, all orders from P1 through P8 have arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods. Therefore, I will stick with L=4. In-transit inventory is 442 units, consisting of orders from P9 (137), P10 (94), P11 (104), and P12 (107). Demand has shown relative stability following the initial seed data, with recent samples (P1-P12) showing a mean of approximately 101.9 units. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P5-P12) have a mean of 103.6. I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution most accurately while accommodating the confirmed 4-period lead time (making the review+lead period 5 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated from Period 5 through Period 13 concludes). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 13 periods (from game history) is: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126, 97, 102, 114, 90, 111. The mean of these 13 samples is approximately 102.3 units per period. Prior samples (provided in prompt: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) also revolve around a similar mean. There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality at this stage, as fluctuations appear to be random noise around the mean. On-hand inventory is 34, and in-transit is 414. Total pipeline + on-hand is 448. Given L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 102.3 = 511.5 units. The current total inventory (448) is slightly below the expected requirement. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable at the promised 4 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=13 for demand parameters to capture the observed mean and variance from the game history, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 14 (orders from P1 to P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern. Over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), demand has averaged 103.5 units, which is consistent with the overall average of approximately 101.8 units across all 14 periods. There is no significant trending or seasonal shift evident in the data. With an on-hand inventory of 33 and in-transit units of 420 (covering orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 10 periods to capture the current stable regime while filtering out the initial warm-up noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by all completed arrivals (P5 through P15). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since simulation start, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. Based on the 15 observational periods available, the mean demand is 99.2 units per period. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in the recent data (P13-15 shows demand of 111, 95, 64). The on-hand inventory is 73 units, and the pipeline inventory is 418 units (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15), which matches the expected lead-time cycle. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to leverage the stable 4-period history and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the full available historical sample for the backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around an average of 95 units per period over the last 15 periods (Periods 2-16). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival from Period 5 through Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 88, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 355 units (orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual observed lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime observed since Period 2, ignoring the initial outlier observation of 122 in Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable decline over the last three periods (64, 92, 37) compared to the historical average of approximately 100 per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (160 units) relative to recent demand. Every shipment since the game began has arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, confirming the lead time is stable. Given the recent drop in demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P13-P17) to capture this downward trend for the forecast (mu_hat), while maintaining a slightly larger window (N=10) for volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid under-reacting to the historical noise. The lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the history provides a clear and consistent actual lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 15: demand decreased from a mean of ~100 to ~64 over the last 3 periods, though volatility remains present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a shift in the recent periods. While the previous mean was around 100, the last four periods (P15-P18) recorded demands of 64, 92, 37, and 92, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 71.25. The current on-hand inventory is high at 168 units, and there are 226 units in transit (specifically, orders from P15, P16, and P17 are expected in the coming periods). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. Given the high pipeline inventory and the recent downward trend in demand, I will use a N=4 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining the stable lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-245.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend. Since Period 15, the demand has been 64, 92, 37, 92, and most recently a very low 5. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 58, compared to the initial 100+. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 265) with a steady pipeline of 136 units, which is more than enough to cover the forecasted demand for the next (L+1) periods, given the promised lead time of 4. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent slowdown while allowing the OR engine to wind down orders. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility during this demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 15-19 dropped to ~58 units/period, down from the previous ~100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-109.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically averaging around 100 units, the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P15-P20) has dropped to approximately 46.3 units (64, 92, 37, 92, 5, 40). Period 19 saw an extreme low of 5 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 269 and in-transit at 92 (total 361 pipeline), and current demand trends significantly lower than historical averages, the goal is to prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs. I will set N=6 for demand forecasting to lock into this lower regime, while maintaining the default lead time calculation which is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 15-20 has dropped significantly to ~46 units/period (down from ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-164.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downward shift starting around Period 15. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P15-P21) is approximately 32 units, compared to the initial ~100 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P19-P21) showed demand of 5, 40, and 37. Currently, on-hand inventory is 312 units, which is extremely high given the new demand regime (approx. 10 periods of supply). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed arrivals. To prevent further inventory accumulation and minimize holding costs while the backend adjusts, I will use recent_N (N=7 to capture the shift) for demand forecasting and let the system target a lower base stock. Given the current inventory levels, the capped policy will naturally result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 15-21 has stabilized at a lower level of ~44 units/period (33.7 if focusing only on P15-P21, but including earlier samples for variance).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-87.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a significantly lower regime since Period 15. The historical mean of approximately 100 units/period has dropped to an average of roughly 40 units/period over the last 8 periods (Periods 15-22). Specifically, the demand in the most recent 5 periods was 5, 40, 37, and 45 (avg ~32). On-hand inventory is currently 267 units, which is extremely high given this new demand level and the promised lead time of 4. At an average demand of 40, this stock covers over 6 periods by itself. Pipeline inventory is minimal (12 units from the order in P19). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To avoid further excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 samples (the duration of the current regime) and use default calculated variance. The high on-hand levels will naturally cause the OR backend to output an order of 0 until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 15-22 has stabilized at approximately 40 units/period, a significant decrease from the earlier mean of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-214.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 15. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P15-P23) is approximately 47 units, compared to the initial ~100 units. More specifically, the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) have shown an even lower average of approximately 28 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (266 units) relative to this new demand level and the high holding cost ($1.00/unit), and considering that we have 40 units in-transit (ordered P23), we are currently significantly overstocked. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to reflect the lower demand regime while maintaining enough history to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition. This will signal the OR backend to stop ordering until the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 15-23 has dropped significantly to approximately 47 units/period from the initial ~100 units/period baseline. Recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is even lower at ~28 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From an initial average of ~100 units/period (P1-P14), demand has decelerated to an average of ~41 units/period since Period 15. The most recent 5-period average (P20-P24) is even lower at ~35.8 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory (222) is very high relative to the new demand levels, sufficient for over 5 periods of supply even without in-transit arrivals. The goal is to set parameters that reflect this lower demand regime to allow the current inventory to deplete and avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the shift while maintaining some smoothing, and keep lead time at the calculated historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Periods 15-24 is ~41 units/period, down from the original ~100 units/period baseline. Current on-hand inventory is significantly elevated relative to this new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $723.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, a sudden and significant demand spike of 189 units occurred, which sharply contrasted with the previous low-demand regime (~41 units/period) observed from Periods 15 to 24. This spike significantly reduced the excess inventory built up during the previous low-demand phase, leaving only 33 units on-hand. While it is unclear if this is a one-time anomaly or a return to the initial high-demand level (~100 units/period), the risk of stocking out (opportunity cost of $4.0 vs holding cost of $1.0) warrants a more aggressive inventory target than the previous 'recent_N' would provide. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the entirety of the demand transition from P15 to P25 (mean ~54, including the spike) which balances the lower regime with the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 25 (189 units), departing from the low-demand regime established since Period 15 (~40 units). Current inventory strategy must account for potential return to higher volatility or mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system ran out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) due to a lingering low-inventory state following the massive demand spike in Period 25 (189 units). Period 26 demand returned to a more moderate level (39 units), but we still missed 6 units of sales. There is a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Current in-transit inventory is 211 units (P23=40, P24=0, P25=27, P26=144). The order from Period 23 (40 units) is expected to arrive during Period 27's arrival phase, but because on-hand is currently 0, we are at risk if Period 27 demand occurs before arrival or exceeds arrival volume. The demand pattern is highly volatile: a long low-regime (P15-24, avg ~41) followed by a massive spike (P25=189) and a moderate return (P26=39). I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=12) to capture the pre-spike low regime plus the spike itself (avg ~52.5) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this heightened volatility. I am setting L to 4 as established by historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Experienced stockout (ending inventory 0, lost sales: 6) due to the Period 25 demand spike draining safety stock. Demand volatility has increased significantly compared to the P15-P24 stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited significant volatility recently. After a sustained low-demand period (P15-P24, mean ~41), a major spike occurred in P25 (189 units), followed by a return to lower levels in P26 (39 units) and P27 (16 units). In P26, a stockout occurred because safety stock was insufficient to handle the P25 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current strategy must balance the recent low demand with the demonstrated risk of massive spikes. Using a recent window of 13 periods (P15-P27) captures both the low-demand regime and the extreme volatility of P25, which is necessary to calculate a robust sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend maintains enough safety stock for future spikes while adjusting the mean down from the initial ~100 range. Current in-transit (310) plus on-hand (24) is 334 units, which is roughly 6.6 periods of the long-term average (50). Recent orders (P26: 144, P27: 139) are already addressing the stockout; our parameters will maintain this coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 25 saw a spike (189) that was ~4.5x the average of the preceding 10 periods, causing a stockout in Period 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting significant seasonal/promotional volatility. We have observed two massive demand spikes in the last 4 periods: Period 25 (189) and Period 28 (199), which contrast sharply with the low-demand regime seen in Periods 15-24 (mean ~41). This suggests a shift into a high-volatility or recurring peak-demand state. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple stockouts despite arrivals (P27 arrived 40). We have 341 units in-transit, but lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning the large replenishment orders placed in P26 (144) and P27 (139) will not arrive until P30 and P31 respectively. To protect against the stockouts observed in P26 and P28 and account for the new high-demand peaks, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 500 (representing a forecast of 100 per period over the 1+4 period lead time window, which is the historical baseline before the P15 drop) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 150 to account for the massive variance seen recently (4.5x spikes).

Carry-over insight: Recurring high-demand spikes confirmed (Period 25: 189, Period 28: 199). The low-demand regime (P15-P24) has ended, replaced by high volatility and stockout risk. Baseline demand for safety stock should return to ~100 units/period with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 and facing a critical stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history indicates that the low-demand regime (P15-P24) has been replaced by a highly volatile environment with massive periodic spikes (P25: 189, P28: 199, P29: 136). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 115.8, but the variance is extremely high. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P23 arrived P27, P25 arrived P29). Since current on-hand is 0 and we've suffered three consecutive stockouts or near-stockouts (P26, P28, P29), we must significantly raise our inventory targets. I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 600 units (representing a mean of 120 over L+1 = 5 periods) to account for the current high-demand spikes. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 250 to provide a robust safety stock buffer given the extreme volatility (spikes around 200 units).

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime confirmed: Periods 25-29 show demand spikes of 189, 199, and 136, contrasting with the previous low-demand period. Baseline demand has shifted back towards ~110-120 units/period with high variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 25 onward confirms a shift back to a high-volatility, high-demand regime, with demand spikes reaching 189, 199, and 136 units. The tranquil period observed between P15-P24 (mean ~41) has ended. Based on the spikes and recent demand volatility, the expected demand mean is returning toward the 110-120 range. Using N=6 for mu_hat correctly captures this transition (Periods 25-30: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P23 arrived P27, P25 arrived P29, P26 arrived P30). The system is currently recovering from stockouts in P26, P28, and P29, hence the high in-transit amount of 667; however, to ensure the new volatility is cushioned by safety stock, I will use recent_N=6 to allow the OR backend to calculate appropriate variance for the safety stock level.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime transition confirmed: Period 25-30 demand shows extreme variance (mean ~98, std ~82), moving away from the previously stable low-demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting at Period 25, characterized by large spikes (189, 199, 136) interspersed with lower demand periods (13, 122). The recent 7-period average (P25-P31) is approximately 101.5 units, which aligns with the historical baseline of ~100 prior to the Period 15 dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23, P25, P26, and P27. With 'In-transit' at 528 and 'On-hand' at 148, total pipeline inventory is 676. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to handle the transition back to higher demand (recent_N=7 to capture the volatile regime), and sigma_hat to recent_N=7 to account for the significantly increased variance. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the higher risk of stockouts seen in Periods 26, 28, and 29.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 25. Recent demand samples show extreme fluctuations (P25: 189, P28: 199, P29: 136, P31: 122 vs. P30: 13, P32: 55). Calculating demand statistics based on the last 8 periods (P25-P32) captures this high-variance environment, yielding a mean of approximately 106 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31 and P32 arrived exactly 4 periods after being ordered). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), the OR engine needs to balance the risk of stockouts (which were frequent between P26-P29) against the high cost of carrying excess inventory. Using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the forecast reflects the current 'high spike' behavior rather than the previous 'low demand' regime of P15-P24.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 25, characterized by extreme swings\u2014spikes near 200 units (P25, P28) followed by troughs as low as 13-17 units (P30, P33). The recent 9-period mean (P25-P33) is approximately 87 units, but the standard deviation is extremely high (~75), necessitating a larger safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 26, 28, and 29. Currently, on-hand inventory (318) and in-transit (288) are significant, largely due to the arrival of the large Period 29 order (211 units). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this new high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for protection against spikes while acknowledging the current high inventory levels, which the OR backend will handle by reducing the order size as pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P25-P33) confirmed: demand fluctuates between extreme spikes (~200) and low troughs (~15), with a regime mean of ~87 and high standard deviation (~75).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment continues to be characterized by high volatility, though recent periods (P32-P34) have shown lower demand (55, 17, 56) following a series of significant spikes. The inventory level is currently very high (548 units) due to large orders placed during the stockout phase (P29-P30) arriving now. With demand averaging ~87 in this volatile regime (P25-P34) and high standard deviation (~75), the current on-hand inventory plus in-transit units (550 total) is sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand, exceeding the L+1 (5 period) requirement. My goal is to allow inventory to draw down to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the next possible spike. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10, covering the volatile regime since P25) for demand and volatility to ensure the backend base stock covers potential spikes without triggering unnecessary new orders given the current surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-468.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 25, characterized by extreme spikes (up to 199) and deep troughs (as low as 13/16). Analyzing the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the mean demand is approximately 78 units with a high standard deviation (approx 72), reflecting this instability. Currently, the on-hand inventory is exceptionally high (532 units) due to massive orders placed during the stockout periods (P29-P30) finally arriving. This inventory level is more than sufficient to cover at least 6 periods of average demand, even at the current volatility levels. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the large surplus, the immediate goal is to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete naturally to avoid excessive costs. I will maintain parameters that reflect the high volatility (recent_N=11) to ensure the base stock calculation remains realistic for the current regime, but the system's 'cap' and 'pipeline' logic will naturally prevent new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P25-P36) confirms a high-volatility regime. Demand oscillates between extreme spikes (P25: 189, P28: 199, P29: 136, P36: 187) and significant troughs (P30: 13, P33: 17, P35: 16). The mean demand over these last 12 periods is approximately 88 units/period, with a very high standard deviation of ~75. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 345 units, which is quite high. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). The expected demand for 5 periods at the current regime average is ~440 units. With 345 on-hand and 8 in-transit (Total Pipeline = 353), we are slightly below the expected base stock level but still hold significant inventory. I will use a 12-period window (P25-P36) to capture this volatile regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. While the calculated base stock might suggest a small order, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will ensure we don't over-order while we draw down the current excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P25-P36) characterized by extreme demand spikes (~190) and low periods (~15), with a mean of ~88 and standard deviation of ~75.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high volatility regime identified starting at Period 25 continues, with demand fluctuating between extreme highs (~190-200) and lows (~15). Recent demand from P25 to P37 shows a mean of approximately 88 units and a high standard deviation (approx 75). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 236 units, with 216 units in-transit (orders from P35, P37). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high variance and the stockout risks observed in earlier spikes (P26, P28, P29), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the volatility shift at P25) to provide the OR backend with a realistic estimate of the current mean and the significant volatility needed for safety stock calculation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P38) is characterized by extreme volatility and spikes, with demand ranging from 13 to 199. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility period (last 14 samples) is approximately 88.5, while the standard deviation is high at approximately 72.8. In-transit inventory is currently 344 units, with a large order from Period 37 (210 units) expected to arrive in Period 41. On-hand inventory has dropped to 57 units after a high demand period (179 in P38). I will set L to 4 (promised and recently observed), and use recent_N (N=14) to capture the current high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean since the low trough of P15-P24 and the significant safety stock required for the frequent ~190 unit spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current high-variance regime (P25-P39). Period 39 experienced a stockout as demand (197) far exceeded on-hand inventory (63), following strong demand in Periods 38 (179) and 36 (187). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I have 552 units in-transit, but arrivals are scattered. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high sigma (approx. 78 units/period since P25) and a mean demand around 100 units/period (recent average: P35-P39 is 138, but the broader volatile regime mean is closer to 100), I will set mu_hat to look at the last 15 periods (since the regime shift at P25) to capture this new volatility accurately. Sigma_hat will also be set based on this 15-period windows to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the frequent ~200-unit spikes. Current in-transit levels (552) are high, so the backend's capped policy will likely throttle new orders while we wait for the pipeline to arrive and replenish the stockout.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P25-P39) confirmed: demand fluctuates between extreme spikes (~200) and low troughs (~15), with a regime mean of ~95 and standard deviation of ~78. Stockouts are frequent during demand spikes when pipeline lead times are long.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility demand regime (starting Period 25) where demand fluctuates between extreme spikes (~200) and low troughs (~15). The current mean demand for this regime (P25-P40) is approximately 96 units/period with a high standard deviation (approx 74). Period 39 and 40 have seen high demand (197 and 75 respectively) resulting in a stockout since on-hand inventory is 0. However, there is a massive pipeline of 653 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are expecting the large order from P37 (210 units) to arrive in P41 and the order from P38 (128 units) in P42. Because the on-hand inventory is currently zero and we just suffered a significant stockout in P39 and P40, the goal is to set parameters that stabilize the inventory level against these high-demand spikes once the pipeline arrives. I will use the statistics from the high-volatility regime (last 16 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-170.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, characterized by extreme spikes (near 200 units) and deep troughs (under 10 units), which has been a consistent pattern since Period 25. The current period (42) follows a low-demand period (Period 41: demand = 8), which resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 202 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent history (P37 order arrived in P41). To determine OR parameters, I analyze the 'High Volatility' regime (P25-P41). During this 17-period window, the mean demand is approximately 95 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 75. Given the high stockout risk during spikes and the high holding cost ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($4/unit), the OR engine needs to maintain slightly higher safety stock than the low-demand regime, but be mindful of the large pipeline (443 units in-transit). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the full scope of this volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-235.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility (High Volatility Regime started P25), characterized by spikes nearing 200 units and troughs as low as 8 units. Since Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation around 78. In Period 42, demand was low (19), following a low Period 41 (8). The delivery lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 311 units with 315 units in-transit (orders from P39 and P40). Total pipeline inventory is 626. Given the average demand of ~95, a base-stock level for (L+1) = 5 periods would be around 475 units plus safety stock. With 626 units already in the pipeline/on-hand, we are well-covered. To manage the OR backend's order calculation, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the high-volatility regime (last 18 periods, P25-P42) to ensure the safety stock is robust against the next likely spike while preventing excessive over-ordering given the high current inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25, oscillating between near-zero troughs (e.g., P41: 8) and massive spikes (e.g., P43: 192). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (333) following the arrival of a large order (214 units) in Period 43. With 101 units in-transit (ordered P40), total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 434 units. Over the last 19 periods (P25-P43), the mean demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of 75. Given a 4-period lead time, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (review + lead time). 434 units covers roughly 4.6 periods of average demand (95 * 4.6 = 437). Because the game is near its end (Period 44 of 50), and on-hand inventory is currently high, the goal is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer against the next ~200-unit spike. I will use the established high-volatility regime (N=19) to set parameters, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these extreme swings.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, characterized by high-demand spikes (~200 units) followed by very low troughs (e.g., Period 44 demand was only 1 unit). From Period 25 to Period 44, the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units with a standard deviation of about 76.5. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 433 units, and there are 189 units in transit (ordered in Period 44). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covering 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead). The expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 458 units (91.5 * 5). Between our on-hand (433) and in-transit (189), our total pipeline inventory is 622 units, which is well above the expected mean and includes a significant safety buffer for volatility. I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture this specific high-volatility regime starting at Period 25. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the mean and variance of this current cycle, ensuring we balance the high holding cost of the current excess inventory against the risk of the next ~200-unit spike.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Period 25-45). Recent spikes include 192 (P43) and 149 (P45), interspersed with very low demand periods like 1 (P44). The mean demand since the volatility shift (P25) is approximately 95 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 77. Currently, on-hand inventory is 284, and there are 189 units in-transit (ordered on P44), totaling 473 units of pipeline inventory. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and the pipeline inventory already covers approximately 5 periods of average demand (473 / 95 \u2248 4.97), I will maintain the current forecast parameters. This level of inventory acts as a buffer against the 'extreme' spikes (observed at ~200) during the final periods while managing the risk of high holding costs if demand remains low.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, consistent with the regime established in Period 25. Recent demand samples show a mix of low troughs ($1, 8, 19$) and high peaks ($192, 149, 159$). Over the high-volatility window (P25-P46), mean demand is ~94 units with a standard deviation of ~77. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (most recent arrivals: P40 order arrived P44). In-transit inventory (303 units) includes orders from Period 44 (189) and Period 46 (114). On-hand inventory is 125. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for $L+1=5$ periods. Given the high volatility and stockout risks observed previously, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) with $N=22$ (covering the entire high-volatility regime from Period 25 to 46). This ensures the OR backend uses the higher variance to set a sufficient safety stock level to handle upcoming spikes while maintaining the 4-period lead time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are navigating a high-volatility regime that started around Period 25. Demand is characterized by extreme spikes (often >180) followed by sharp troughs. Period 47 concluded with a stockout (demand 162, sold 125, ending 0), indicating that the high-demand phase is active. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 423 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high coefficient of variation in the current regime (P25-P47), I will use 'recent_23' for demand parameters to capture this volatility while weighting the high-demand spikes appropriately to build safety stock for the final periods (the game ends at Period 50). This should trigger orders to cover potential spikes in the remaining periods while accounting for the large pipeline soon to arrive.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P25-P47) remains active: characterized by demand cycles ranging from near-zero to ~200. Most recent 3 periods (P45-P47) show consistently high demand (149, 159, 162), confirming the need for higher safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-volatility regime that started at Period 25. Recent demand has shown a sequence of high values (P45: 149, P46: 159, P47: 162) followed by a moderate value (P48: 59). To capture this behavior while acknowledging the high variance (spikes up to ~200), I am using a recent window of 24 periods (P25-P48) for both mean and standard deviation. This covers the entire current regime, balancing the high spikes against the low troughs. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 1 period remaining (P50), the goal is to cover the final period's demand while minimizing ending inventory. On-hand is 130 and in-transit is 451, which is substantial relative to the regime average (~95), but the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally throttle the order if the pipeline is full.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a high-volatility regime (P25-P49) characterized by extreme demand swings between 1 and 200 units. Most recently, P45-P49 saw elevated demand (149, 159, 162, 59, 144), leading to a stockout in Period 49. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P44 order arriving in P48. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 500 units in-transit, there is a risk of further stockouts if upcoming arrivals are delayed or if demand spikes persist. To mitigate this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) focusing on the last 25 periods (the start of the high-volatility regime) to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history, while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to ensure a high safety stock buffer against the observed ~200-unit spikes. The backend logic will combine these to set a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P25-P49) remains active: demand fluctuates between 1 and 200 units with a regime mean of ~95 and high variability. Frequent stockouts occur when demand spikes coincide with low on-hand inventory.
