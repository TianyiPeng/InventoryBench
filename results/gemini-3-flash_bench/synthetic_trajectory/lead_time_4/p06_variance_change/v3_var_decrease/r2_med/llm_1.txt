Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for at least 5 periods (L+1) to ensure service level during the lead time gap, especially starting from an empty inventory. I will target a total pipeline of approximately 275 units (55 avg * 5 periods). Since there is zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, I will place an initial order for 275 units to establish the pipeline.

Historical demand data provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) suggests a volatile demand pattern for these chips, with an average of approximately 55 units per period. However, given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for a 5-period window (L+1). My current pipeline (275 units) is intended to cover the demand starting around Period 5. Based on the historical average of ~55/period, 275 units should theoretically cover about 5 periods of demand. However, Period 1 demand (145) was significantly higher than the sampling average. To be safe and maximize profit while accounting for the high initial demand spike, I will place an additional order to ensure I am not stocked out immediately upon the first shipment's arrival, especially if the high demand persists.

Combined with 342 on-hand, I have 642 units to cover the next 5 periods (P15-P19). Given the average demand across all periods is approximately 100 units, 642 units provides roughly 6.4 periods of coverage. Ordering more now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit) given the current surplus and incoming stock. I will pass on ordering this period to allow inventory to deplete closer to optimal safety levels.",

Currently, the position (631) is sufficient to cover this target. However, since we must place an order to maintain the pipeline for P34 (P29 decision + 4 periods lead time + 1 period for coverage), and the current pipeline is structured with rolling orders of 100, I will continue this trend to maintain stability. The current surplus (631 vs 525) is relatively small and provides a cushion against potential spikes, but ordering another 100 units ensures the pipeline remains full as old in-transit units arrive and are consumed.",
