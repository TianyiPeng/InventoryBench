Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since there is no prior history to read (no 'conclude' messages), we must rely on the provided historical demand samples (P1-P5: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12). The mean of these 5 samples is 54.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 65.9. Given the high variance and limited data, I will use the default methods for the first decision to establish a baseline. The OR backend will use these historical samples to calculate the base stock level, aiming to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. No shipments are currently in transit, and on-hand inventory is 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 162 units was placed. While 'arrived=0' is noted in the Period 1 conclude message, this is expected behavior under the promised lead time of 4 periods; the order is correctly reflected in the 'In-transit' balance. Demand in Period 1 was 56 units. Historical data for the last 5 periods (including this game's Period 1) shows demand of [58, 163, 41, 0, 12, 56]. The mean is 55.0 and the standard deviation is 58.6. Given the high volatility (CV > 1) and the fact that we are only in Period 2, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 (all available samples) to capture the base statistics while allowing for the backend to calculate the base stock. The high variation requires a robust buffer, but initially, we must wait for the pipeline to start arriving.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and there have been no arrivals yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (162 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5, and Period 2 orders (151 units) in Period 6. Historical demand for the first two periods was 56 and 106. Since the inventory is currently 0, all demand is being lost. The target service level based on the critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) is 0.80. Given the short history (5 samples provided in prompt: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12), the mean demand is 54.8. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat should be approximately 5 * 54.8 = 274. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the available history and 'default' for L.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (162 units) are expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P5 (visible P6), and orders from P2 (151 units) are expected in P6 (visible P7). Total demand in Periods 1-3 was 56, 106, and 71 units, totaling 233 units of lost sales because on-hand inventory was zero. No calendar dates or specific product descriptions beyond 'chips(Regular)' are provided, so I am relying on the existing 3 samples. The mean demand is approximately 78 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and have 0 on-hand inventory with 313 units in transit, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) and use all available samples (N=3) to estimate demand and volatility. The OR backend will use these to determine if the 313 units in transit are sufficient to reach the base stock target for a 5-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is critical: On-hand inventory is 0, and all customer demand has been lost so far because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (after this decision) and be visible in Period 6's status. Since we have not reached Period 6, we cannot yet confirm if lead times are drifting or if shipments are lost. Total demand for the last 5 periods was: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12 (as per historical data provided, noting that 'conclude' messages show slightly different values, I will use the provided samples list). Demand is highly volatile. I will use 'default' for L (4) for now. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples to capture the variance, but I will adjust the explicit 'mu_hat' to account for (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand is ~54.8. 5 * 54.8 = 274. Standard deviation is ~65. sqrt(5) * 65 = 145. Since we haven't sold anything yet, the backlog of 'lost' demand isn't technically tracked in the system, but the pipeline is already 433 units deep. Setting explicit values to ensure we don't over-order until the first shipment arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). Total demand history for Periods 1-5 is [56, 106, 71, 198, 26]. Note: the historical demand in the prompt introduction ([58, 163, 41, 0, 12]) differs from the game history log; I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages for statistics. Average demand over these 5 periods is 91.4. The current on-hand inventory is 136 and in-transit is 271 (orders from Periods 2 and 4). Since lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, I will stick with the default (promised) lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the high variance seen in Period 4. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L) * mean covers the 5-period window (Review + Lead Time).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 252 units on hand and 295 units in transit (orders from P4 and P6). Historical lead time analysis confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order arrived in P6). Demand history shows significant volatility: an initial high-demand phase (P1-P4 mean ~108) followed by a sharp drop in P5-P6 (mean ~30). The total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 547) currently covers nearly 5 periods of the higher demand average or ~18 periods of the recent low demand average. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all available samples (N=6) for mu_hat provides a balanced mean (~82) between the early peak and recent trough, while recent_N=3 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility seen during the transition. No orders are currently missing or late.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 159 units on-hand and 341 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from Period 5 and 6, the actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. The order from Period 4 (120 units) is expected to arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 8, though it will only be visible in the Period 8 conclude message. Demand has been volatile: the initial 5 samples (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) have shifted to a different pattern in Periods 1-7 (56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35, 93). Current mean demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is ~84.6. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Total pipeline inventory (341) + on-hand (159) = 500 units. A demand of ~85 per period for 5 periods equals 425 units, suggesting we are currently well-covered but must maintain the order cycle. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this recent variability and 'default' for lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-144.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals of Period 1, 2, and 4 orders). On-hand inventory is currently 252 units, with 274 units in transit. The demand history across the first 8 periods shows significant volatility, with recent values (P5-P8) being notably lower (avg ~45) compared to the initial periods (P1-P4 avg ~107). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or high variance. Given the (L+1) planning horizon (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture this recent lower-demand trend while maintaining sufficient safety stock to buffer against the observed high variance. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the confirmed 4-period lead time from history.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P8) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 217, with 274 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8). Demand has been volatile: initially high (P1-P4 mean ~107), followed by a significant drop (P5-P9 mean ~43). Given this clear regime shift, I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to avoid over-ordering based on early high-demand outliers. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' as the observed lead times match the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average decreased from ~107 to ~43 (-60%).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 349 units on-hand and 99 units in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). Demand has significantly shifted starting at Period 5. For Periods 1-4, average demand was 107.75. For Periods 5-10, average demand dropped to 43.16. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (349) plus in-transit (99) equals 448 units, which covers over 10 periods of the current average demand (43.16). The OR backend's cap mechanism will likely prevent ordering, but to ensure the logic reflects the new regime, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the lower demand pattern observed since Period 5.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current status shows 157 units on-hand and 53 units in-transit (ordered in Period 8). All previous orders have arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by the arrival of the Period 7 order in Period 11). Demand analysis shows a significant spike in Period 11 (238 units) compared to the previous 'low demand' regime (avg ~43). Considering the historical data (Periods 1-4 avg ~107) and this new spike, the demand appears highly volatile or potentially returning to a higher mean. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the lead time is stable. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (Periods 5-11) to capture the recent regime including both the low dip and the sharp spike, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 71 units per period ((26+35+93+27+35+43+238)/7 = 71). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the high volatility introduced by the Period 11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 11 (238 units), potentially ending the low-demand regime observed from Periods 5-10.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the chip(Regular) SKU is exhibiting a significant return to high-demand levels. After a low-demand regime from Periods 5-10 (average ~43), demand spiked to 238 in Period 11 and remained high at 161 in Period 12. These two periods average ~200 units, contrasting sharply with the previous regime and the promised lead time of 4. With 198 units in transit (ordered P12) and 49 on-hand, we are at risk of stockouts if demand remains elevated above 150-200. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this sudden surge, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=2 to account for the high volatility observed in P11-P12. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1, P2, P4, P6, P7, P8 have all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 11: End of low-demand period (P5-P10, avg ~43); demand has returned to high levels (P11-P12 avg ~200).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Demand history shows two distinct regimes: a high-demand period initially (P1-P4 avg ~107), a low-demand slump (P5-P10 avg ~43), and a return to significantly higher demand since Period 11 (P11-P13: 238, 161, 121, averaging ~173). Period 13 ended with a stockout (0 on-hand inventory), so we must aggressively restock. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (P11-P13) has only 3 data points, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent surge. Given the recent stockout and high demand (averaging 173 over the last 3 periods), mu_hat should reflect demand across (1+L) = 5 periods. Using N=3 for mu_hat yields a base forecast of 173.33 * 5 \u2248 867. To ensure we recover from the stockout and handle the increased volatility seen in Period 11, I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat as well to provide a higher safety stock buffer.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), the observed demands were 238, 161, 121, and 117, resulting in an average of 159.25 units per period. This shift is confirmed by the Carry-over Insights from Period 13. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 because the high demand exhausted existing stock before the replenishment orders from the high-demand period could arrive. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by recent arrivals (P5-P12). Using a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My mu_hat calculation is based on the average of the last 4 periods (159.25 * 5 = 796.25), and I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility seen recently (std of P11-P14 is approx 55, so 55 * sqrt(5) \u2248 123). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand spike while balancing the risk of stockouts during the lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 11, returning to higher levels. In the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 238, 161, 121, 117, and 96, averaging approximately 146.6 units per period. I am choosing N=5 for the recent demand samples to capture this 'high-demand' state. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as noted in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 900 units in transit (ordered in P12, P13, P14, P15). We must ensure the base stock levels are set appropriately for the current high-demand regime using a recent window (N=5) for both mu and sigma calculation to avoid excessive safety stock during this period of moderate volatility. The OR engine's cap and base stock logic will account for the large in-transit volume, likely resulting in a zero-order result to allow inventory to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 11: Mean demand across P11-P15 is ~147 units, compared to ~43 units in the previous low-demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 11, moving away from a low-demand period (P5-P10). From P11 to P16, demand has averaged approximately 138.6 units (samples: 238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99). Setting N=6 for mu_hat captures this current higher-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P16 of the P12 order (4 periods). With 99 units on hand and 702 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed in P13-P15 that are due to arrive in P17-P19), the pipeline is currently very full. Using N=6 for sigma_hat accounts for the increased volatility observed since Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, returning to higher levels. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the mean demand is approximately 149 units per period (1043 total / 7). Period 17 saw 112 units of demand, and on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 277 units following the arrival of the P13 order. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-shift behavior (P11-P17), which results in a forecast covering the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the current volatility, including the spike at P11. With 412 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15, which should arrive in P18, P19), the pipeline is currently very full. The OR backend will likely scale back ordering to keep inventory targets efficient and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 11) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 133 units per period (average demand from P11 to P18). Current on-hand inventory is 464 units, and there are 220 units in-transit (140 from P15 and 80 from P18). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand and the pipeline is healthy, the OR backend should maintain the current regime's service level. I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculate method for lead time as the 4-period duration is well-established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-104.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 504 units, with 133 units in transit (ordered in Periods 18 and 19). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals (P12-P15 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 11. Over the last 9 periods (P11-P19), demand has averaged 125.4 units per period (samples: 238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99, 112, 85, 100). This replaces the high volatility seen early in this regime (the 238 in Period 11 was an outlier compared to the more stable 85-117 range seen recently). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high current inventory (504), which already covers over 4 periods of average demand, I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current demand level. This will likely result in a lower order or no order from the OR backend to reduce excess holding costs while maintaining a 0.8 service level (z* \u2248 0.84 based on p=4, h=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: average demand from Period 13-19 is ~104 units, showing lower volatility compared to the initial shift in Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent regime since Period 13. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), the average demand is approximately 108.5 units, with significantly lower volatility compared to the spike in Period 11. Specifically, the demand from P16-P20 was 99, 112, 85, 100, and 138 respectively. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in historical completions (P5, P6, P8, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P19 all show a lead time of 4). I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P13-P20) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the outlier spike from P11 and the previous low-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory (366) and in-transit units (213) are healthy, so the backend policy will likely result in a small or zero order to maintain the target base stock without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the shift at Period 11. Specifically, from Period 13 to Period 21, the mean demand is 115 units (121, 117, 96, 99, 112, 85, 100, 138, 77), with a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals ending at Period 19. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 289, In-transit: 213, total pipeline: 502) are significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (5 periods * 115 units = 575 units). However, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend's target service level (q=0.8) requires a safety stock. I will use a window of the last 9 periods (P13-P21) to capture this stable post-shift regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This protects against the stockouts observed in Periods 13-15 while preventing further overstocking beyond the current high on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (Period 13-21) has further stabilized with a mean of ~115 units and reduced volatility compared to the initial Period 11 spike.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 13 into a consistent regime with a mean of approximately 112 units (Periods 13-22). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. Currently, inventory is healthy: on-hand is 283 units and in-transit is 192 units (orders from P19, P20, and P22). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory level should cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Given the current mean of ~112, the required base stock is roughly 560 units. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 475 units. I will set the mu_hat method to recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (starting around Period 13) and use the standard lead time L=4. This ensures the OR backend targets the 5-period demand window while maintaining an appropriate service level based on the observed volatility (sigma_hat) in this regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 104 units (Periods 13-23: 121, 117, 96, 99, 112, 85, 100, 138, 77, 86, 53). However, volatility is present, and recent periods (P21-P23) show a slight downward trend compared to the earlier post-shift peak. The inventory level is currently high (On-hand: 283) with significant In-transit stock (215), particularly as orders from Period 20, 22, and 23 are expected soon. Since the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals), L is set to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use a N=11 (Periods 13-23) to capture the stabilized average demand level (~104/period) while acknowledging the recent lower demand values. Sigma_hat will also use N=11 to balance the inventory safety against recent variability. The high on-hand and in-transit inventory relative to the forecast suggests the OR backend will correctly minimize or skip new orders to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13 to Period 24) has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 107 units per period and moderate volatility. Historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals from orders in P18, P19, and P20). I will use the recent_N method for all parameters, focusing on this stable 12-period window (N=12) to ensure the OR backend captures the current mean and standard deviation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 264 units and in-transit is 174 units (orders from P22, P23, P24). The inventory position is healthy relative to the (L+1) lead time demand requirement (~535 units target vs ~438 units current positions), so the backend will modulate the order size according to the calculated base stock and current pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 13, following the high-volatility spike in Period 11. Analysis of demand from Period 13 to Period 25 shows a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 210, and there is a healthy in-transit pipeline of 271 units, totaling 481 units against an expected 4-period lead time demand (~475 units). Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. Given the stability over the last 13 periods, I will use a window of N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this current regime while smoothing out the volatility observed earlier in the game. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the recent average demand and protects against the observed standard deviation in this segment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime following the volatility seen around Period 11. Since Period 13, the demand has fluctuated around a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The most recent 7 periods (P20-P26) show demands of 138, 77, 86, 53, 99, 54, and 92, resulting in a mean of 85.57 units. Reviewing the longer-term stabilized regime desde Period 13 (N=14), the mean is approximately 99 units with moderate variance. Historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. Given the inventory levels (On-hand: 177, In-transit: 254), total pipeline inventory is 431. With a daily mean of ~99, the required base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 495. I will use recent_N=14 to capture the stable post-spike regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use calculate for L as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 13, with a slight decrease in the most recent periods (P21-P27 average is ~77 units, while P13-P20 was ~104). The overall mean for the current regime starting Period 13 is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation around 20-25 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P22 and P23. I will use a recent window of N=15 (covering Period 13-27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable post-shift regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus one period (L+1=5), while balancing the service level against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (Period 13-27) maintains a stable mean of ~96 units with moderate volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 13, with a mean demand of approximately 94.6 units per period and standard deviation around 20 units. Analysis of recent lead times consistently shows a delay of 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals from P18-P24). On-hand inventory is 126 units with 297 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28). I will continue using the recent stable regime (N=16, from P13 to P28) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The backend OR engine's q-ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) and capped policy will help prevent over-ordering while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit margin. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods consistently observed.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 13, following a high-demand spike in Period 11. Analysis of demand from Period 13 to Period 29 shows a mean demand of 90.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The most recent observations (Periods 25-29) show demand values of 54, 92, 76, 90, and 84, maintaining this stability. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 25 (with the exceptions of Periods 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 21 where no orders were placed or expected). Using N=17 (Period 13 to 29) provides the best balance of responsiveness and stability for the current regime. Setting L to the promised 4 periods as observed. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on this stable 17-period window to capture current demand levels and volatility, ensuring sufficient stock while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the post-Period 21 regime. Over the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 82.3 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all recent observations. On-hand inventory is currently 79 units with 325 units in-transit. Since total pipeline inventory (inclusive of the Period 30 order) covers the (L+1) horizon at current demand levels, I will keep parameters focused on this stable regime. Using N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific stable period while ignoring the volatile transition period near Period 11. mu_hat will represent (1+4) * ~82.3 and sigma_hat will represent sqrt(1+4) * ~16.5.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (Period 21-30) reflects a stable mean of ~82 units and lower volatility (std ~16.5) compared to earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $502.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand from Period 21 to 31 shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 89 units and a standard deviation of 22 units. Period 31 saw a spike to 134, but this is within expected volatility for this regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current lead time is 4 periods and the backend considers (1+L) periods of demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (Period 21-31) to capture this stable post-shift behavior while accounting for the recent uptick in demand. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that ensures we cover demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (Period 21-31) reflects a stable mean of ~89 units with a slight increase in volatility (std ~22) compared to the Period 31 snapshot.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 21. Analyzing the window from Period 21 to Period 32, the mean demand is 89.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals (last 5 arrivals all had a lead_time of 4). At the start of Period 33, we have 23 units on-hand and 326 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy looking to cover (L+1) periods. Using a recent window (N=12) for demand mean and volatility ensures the model reacts to the post-Period 21 stability while accounting for the slight increase in demand variance seen in Periods 30-32. This approach balances the stockout risk (profit $4 vs holding $1) by targeting the current demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95 units over the last 13 periods (P21-P33), though a slight upward trend is visible with the most recent 3-period average at ~105 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals from orders made in P28 and P29. On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), while the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 359 units. To ensure inventory bridges the lead time (L=4) plus current period demand (total 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture this stable post-shift regime. Given the slight increase in demand volatility recently (std ~25 in the last 10 periods), I'm using recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against stockouts while maintaining a high service level appropriate for the profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (Period 21-33) maintains a stable average of ~95 units with standard deviation ~23.

=== Period 34 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 21. Over the last 14 periods (P21-P34), the mean demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of 22. Recent periods (P31-P34) show a slight increase in demand volatility and levels (mean ~96), but no major structural shift is confirmed. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as evidenced by recent arrivals (P30 order arrived P34). Current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), meaning we are heavily reliant on the in-transit pipeline (383 units). Given the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend's target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the stable regime since Period 21, ensuring the OR backend balances the current inventory tightness against the risk of overstocking as we enter the final third of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase, with Period 35 demand reaching 108 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand inventory is 0). Over the last 15 periods (starting from Period 21), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8). However, recent periods (31-35) show a slightly higher average demand of around 98 units. To ensure inventory is replenished and to account for the current stockout, I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while providing enough buffer for the service level. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals consistently show a lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21-35 displays a stable mean of ~92 units (std ~23). Recent 5-period average (P31-P35) has ticked up to ~98 units, causing a stockout in P35.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 21) shows a stable mean. Over the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is 92.6 units with a standard deviation of 20.3. However, the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) have shown slightly higher volatility and a mean of 91.8. To protect against the stockouts observed in P35 and the low inventory in P36, I am using recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable post-shift regime while ensuring the OR backend has enough data to account for the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from Periods 27 through 32.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a post-shift regime starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 37, the average demand is 92.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.3 units. Given the inventory position (on-hand: 54, in-transit: 341) and the target base stock calculated as (L+1)*mu, we need to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the 5-period risk window (L=4). Using recent_N=17 captures this stable regime since Period 21. The service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80 suggests a slightly aggressive stocking strategy to minimize stockouts, which occurred as recently as P35. The OR backend will use these samples to maintain a base stock level that accounts for recent volatility and the fixed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 21. Over the last 18 periods (P21-P38), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units with a standard deviation of 20.8. The most recent 5-period average (P34-P38) is 91.4, aligning perfectly with the longer-term stable average. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 68, and in-transit inventory is 319, totaling a pipeline of 387 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At a mean of 91.5, the expected demand over (L+1) is 457.5. Our current position (387) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand, and with a high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1), we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture this stable regime since Period 21, and keep L at default since the promised 4 periods is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to 38 is stable with a mean of ~92 units and standard deviation of ~21.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable. From Period 21 to Period 39, the average demand is approximately 91.2 units with a standard deviation of 20.3. Recent demand (last 5 periods, P35-P39) shows a slight cooling (avg 91.8, but specifically 71 in P39), which maintains the overall stability observed since Period 21. No new regime shifts are detected. I will use recent_N with N=19 (covering P21-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory on hand is 60, and we have significant pipeline stock (346 units) covering the 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs by using the stable statistics from the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent behavior since Period 21, but with a recent spike in Period 40 (134 units). Looking at the past 20 periods (P21-P40), the mean demand is approx 92.5 units with a standard deviation of approx 23 units. In Period 40, we experienced a stockout (sold 123 of 134 demand) due to on-hand inventory hitting zero. We have 349 units in-transit, with orders from P37 (111 units) expected to arrive in Period 41 (concluding P41). To ensure we cover demand over the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the stable post-shift regime while accounting for the recent variability. This allows the backend to set a base stock that should mitigate stockouts while managing holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable with a slight upward trend in volatility. From Period 21 to 41, the mean demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of 22. Recent periods (P40, P41) have seen spikes (134, 117), leading to stockouts because on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the gap before new arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. To ensure better service levels and prevent further stockouts during these small demand spikes, I will use recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime (starting P21). This period covers the most recent stable phase. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as history confirms the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to 41 is confirmed stable with a mean of ~95 units and standard deviation of ~22. Recent stockouts in P40 and P41 were driven by demand spikes exceeding available on-hand buffer.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 21 with a mean of ~95 units. However, consistent stockouts in Periods 40-42 indicate that the fixed base-stock policy used by the backend is underestimating the safety stock needed for current volatility (std ~22), relative to the lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0. An order of 82 units arrived in Period 42, but 35 units of demand were lost. Total pipeline (in-transit) is 408 units, consisting of orders from P39 (90), P40 (66), P41 (125), and P42 (127). The P39 order (90 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 43. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 (covering Period 21 to current) will provide a stable estimate of current requirements. The lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 21 with a mean of approximately 95 units and a standard deviation of 22 based on the last 20+ periods. Recent fluctuations (stockouts in P40-P42) were driven by local demand spikes (134, 117, 117) that exceeded the on-hand buffer, rather than a sustained regime shift. The system is currently in Period 44 of 50, with a lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 48, leaving only two periods (49 and 50) of demand to cover after that. The pipeline inventory (411 units) is currently high relative to the remaining demand in the game (approx. 7 periods left * 95/period = 665 units total). Given on-hand is 13 and pipeline is 411, the base stock policy will naturally manage the stock levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering P21-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime's statistics accurately while filtering out the volatile early game data. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows continued volatility with occasional stockouts (P40, P41, P44), indicating that the safety stock buffer is frequently exhausted. Demand from Period 21 to 44 has a mean of approximately 95 units and a standard deviation of 22. In Period 44, demand was 94 units, leading to a stockout as the starting inventory (including arrivals) was only 79 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are in the final stages of the game (Period 45 of 50), it is crucial to maintain enough inventory to cover the remaining lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods). I will use a recent_N window of 24 periods (from P21 to P44) to capture the stable but volatile post-shift demand regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for both the average demand (~95) and the observed variance to minimize further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to 44 is stable with a mean of ~95 units and standard deviation of ~22. Recurring stockouts (P35, P40, P41, P44) suggest demand spikes frequently exceed the current inventory buffer.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95 units since Period 21, but consistent stockouts (P35, P40, P41, P42, P44) indicate that the safety stock buffer is insufficient for periodic demand spikes (e.g., demand > 115 units). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), I need to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) window, which covers the remainder of the game. I will use a recent_N of 25 to capture the stable distribution since Period 21. To address the stockout issue and maximize service level in these final periods (where profit significantly outweighs holding cost), I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit values. I will forecast a slightly higher mean of 100 to account for recent volatility and a robust sigma to prevent the frequent stockouts observed recently, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to meet the 5-period remaining demand while clearing the pipeline.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a stable regime that began around Period 21. For the period range 21-46, the mean demand is 93.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Recently, demand has shown some volatility resulting in occasional stockouts (P40, P41, P42, P44), including a slight dip in P46 (63 units). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. The current on-hand inventory (84) plus in-transit stock (390) totals 474 units. Given an average demand of ~94 units, total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 376 units. The pipeline is already sufficient to cover this expected demand plus a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=26 (the length of the current stable regime since P21) to capture the long-term stable mean and variance, allowing the OR backend to determine if additional orders are necessary based on the current high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to 46 is stable with a mean of ~93 units and standard deviation of ~23. Pipeline inventory as of P47 is sufficient to cover remaining game demand.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $463.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game concludes at the end of Period 50. Orders placed in the decision phase of Period 48 with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52). Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate profit. Consequently, the goal shifts to liquidating current on-hand inventory and the substantial in-transit pipeline (318 units). The pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (due P48), Period 45 (due P49), and Period 46 (due P50). Specifically: P44 (74 units), P45 (78 units), and P46 (145 units) totaling 297 units, plus the small P47 order (21 units, though it arrives P51). On-hand (49) plus confirmed arrivals for P48-P50 (297) totals 346 units. Average demand is ~95, so we expect ~285 units of demand in the remaining 3 periods. We are already over-inventoried for the remaining duration. I will set the order quantity to zero by using an explicit L of 0 and very low mu_hat to ensure the OR engine does not place further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. For Period 49 and Period 50, the combined expected demand is approximately 190 units (using the stable mean of ~95). Current on-hand inventory is 18 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 244 units. Orders placed in Periods 45, 46, and 47 are expected to arrive in Period 49, 50, and 51 respectively. Specifically, Period 45's order (78 units) should arrive during Period 49, and Period 46's order (145 units) should arrive during Period 50. This total (18 on-hand + 78 expected today + 145 expected tomorrow = 241) is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the remaining two periods. Given that orders placed now (Period 49) would not arrive until Period 53 (long after the simulation ends in Period 50), any additional order would only incur holding costs without the possibility of being sold. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed.

Daily Profit: $364.00, Daily Holding Cost: $5.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. Any order placed now would arrive in Period 54 (L=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, no new orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The current on-hand inventory (5) and in-transit inventory (166 units from Periods 46 and 47) are sufficient to cover the remaining periods if they were to continue, but since this is the final turn, the goal is to stop ordering. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat using methods that minimize the base stock calculation relative to the current pipeline to ensure the OR backend outputs an order of 0.
