Strategy: Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 509. To cover the expected demand of 540, we need to add roughly 31 units.

Strategy: To cover L+1 (5 periods) of demand at the current rate of 102/period, the target stock level should be ~510 units.

In-transit inventory consists of: P41 (139), P42 (110), P43 (128), and P44 (110), totaling 487 units. These will arrive in Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48 respectively. Recent demand (P40-44) has averaged ~108 units following a regime shift. Expected demand over the next 4 periods (45, 46, 47, 48) is ~432 units. Current pipeline (487) + On-hand (72) = 559 units. Subtracting P45-48 demand (559 - 432) leaves an expected 127 units on hand at the start of Period 49. To cover Period 49 and 50 demand (approx 216 units total), we need approximately 89 more units (216 - 127). The OR recommendation is 56, which is conservative. Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), and the fact that this is the last highly effective ordering window, I will increase the order to 110 to ensure full coverage of the final two periods and mitigate the risk of stockouts if demand trends higher toward the end of the game.",

The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The next arrivals are due in P46 (P42 order), P47 (P43 order), P48 (P44 order), and P49 (P45 order). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 98 units (P43-45 avg: 92, P40-45 avg: 107). Current period is 46, game ends at 50. We only need to cover periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 (5 periods of demand total). Estimated total demand remaining = 5 periods * ~100 units/period = 500 units. Total units currently available/incoming = 106 (on-hand) + 110 (P42) + 128 (P43) + 110 (P44) + 110 (P45) = 564 units. This inventory is sufficient to cover demand through the end of the game with a buffer of ~64 units. Adding more will only increase holding costs without contributing to sales, as the game ends on Period 50. The OR recommendation of 51 units likely uses a broader historical mean which is slightly lower than recent local demand, but it also doesn't account for the fixed game end. Given we already have enough stock scheduled to arrive to cover the remaining periods, I will place a zero order to maximize profit by minimizing holding costs at the end of the game.",
