To avoid stockouts while I wait for the 4-period lead time to resolve, I will order 150 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units per period over the last 15 periods (P31-P45), with occasional peaks up to 134. We are currently at Period 46 of 50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50 (46+4=50). This is the final period of the game, making this the last useful order. The goal is to cover demand for Periods 46 through 50. Total expected demand for these 5 periods (L+1) is approximately 500 units (5 * 100). Current inventory position: On-hand is 72, and In-transit total is 425 (consisting of 100 arriving in P46, 100 in P47, 100 in P48, 100 in P49, and 125 in P50 based on P41-P45 orders). Total pipeline + On-hand = 72 + 525 = 597 units. Since we expect to sell about 500 units, we are already slightly over-stocked for the remainder of the game. However, to ensure no stockouts in the final spike and since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), a small safety buffer is acceptable. Ordering 0 is technically optimal to minimize holding costs given the surplus, but a small order of 25 provides a safety net for the final period if demand spikes, while recognizing that any units left at the end of P50 incur a holding cost penalty.",

Period 47 (Period_47) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 36, averaging approximately 95-100 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 109 units. There are 325 units in-transit: specifically, 100 units ordered in each of Periods 43 and 44, and 125 units ordered in Period 45. Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these are scheduled to arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively (visible at the start of Periods 48, 49, and 50). Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). My objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs. Current inventory (109) plus scheduled arrivals (325) equals 434 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50) at a mean of ~100 units/period is approximately 400 units. Adding more inventory through a new order would only incur holding costs or result in leftover stock without generating additional sales within the game timeline.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 48 out of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52). Since the game concludes at Period 50, an order placed now is physically impossible to receive before the game ends. Therefore, placing any additional order is useless and would only potentially incur costs if the game logic were different, but here it simply won't arrive. Our current inventory situation is: 81 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 225 units. Let's verify the arrivals for the remaining two periods: Period 48 arrival (ordered P44): 100 units; Period 49 arrival (ordered P45): 125 units; Period 50 arrival (ordered P46): 0 units. Total units available for the rest of the game: 81 (on-hand) + 100 (arriving P48) + 125 (arriving P49) = 306 units. Expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) at a mean of ~100 units/period is roughly 300 units. We have sufficient stock to cover the remaining periods.",

{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 49 of a 50-period game. In the VM decision phase for Period 49, orders placed will arrive in Period (49+4) = 53, which is beyond the game end. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs (if applicable, though profit is calculated on sales) and will definitely contribute to ending inventory without any opportunity for sale, thus potentially increasing holding costs without adding to total reward. The objective is to maximize Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Current on-hand inventory is 76 units. Expected arrivals during the resolution phase of Period 49 (ordered P45, lead_time 4) is 125 units. Total inventory available to meet demand in Period 49 and 50 will be 76 (current) + 125 (arriving this period) = 201 units. Historical demand has stabilized around ~95-100 units per period. Two periods of demand (P49 and P50) are expected to consume approximately 190-200 units. Total available stock (201) is sufficient to cover remaining demand. Any further ordering would simply increase ending inventory at Period 50, accruing holding costs for zero benefit.",

Since this is Period 50 of 50, this is the final decision period. Any inventory purchased now will arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time) and will never be sold, as there are no subsequent periods. Furthermore, any inventory held at the end of Period 50 will incur a holding cost of $1.0/unit. Based on the observation from Period 49 conclude, we have 110 units on-hand. With expected Period 50 demand around 100 units, we will likely end with approximately 10 units, minimizing the final holding cost penalty. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",
