Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). On-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no 'conclude' messages yet to infer actual lead time, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4). Historical demand samples are [58, 163, 41, 0, 12], with a mean of 54.8. Given the high variance and limited history, I will use all available samples (N=5) to estimate demand. The OR backend will compute the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accommodates the available data points while allowing for future regime detection.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 162 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. Since L=4, we do not expect this order to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5, becoming visible in Period 6's decision phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is 56 (historical avg ~55). Because on-hand is 0, we are losing sales. However, the OR backend logic (base stock - pipeline) will automatically account for the 162 units currently in transit. Given the very short history (1 period concluding), I will utilize the 'default' and 'recent_N' methods. Demand in Period 1 (56) is close to the initial sample mean, so I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the available historical context. The holding cost is equal to profit, meaning the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), so the target inventory level will be close to the mean demand over (L+1) periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and all customer demand in Periods 1 (56 units) and 2 (106 units) has been lost. Total in-transit is 272 (162 from P1 + 110 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in Period 2 and 3 is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or loss. Demand samples (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) show high volatility and a downward trend, but the sample size is very small. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent mean (approx 55) and 'default' for lead time (4) and sigma to manage the high variance observed as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (162 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced total stockouts for the first three periods (demand: 56, 106, 71; sold: 0). The total in-transit quantity is 272 (162 from P1 + 110 from P2). Historical demand shows significant volatility: 56, 106, 71. Since there are only three periods of data, I will use all available samples (N=3) to estimate future demand. Because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), the OR backend will target a service level (q) of 0.5 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). The backend base stock calculation will be (L+1) * mu, where L=4. Given we have no confirmed arrivals yet, 'default' lead time (4) is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 1+4=5 and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (available at Period 6). Thus, we have seen 0 arrivals so far, which is consistent with the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant volatility: 56, 106, 71, 198 (mean ~108). Period 4 saw a sharp spike to 198. Current inventory status: On-hand is 0 (all demand so far has been lost), and In-transit is 389 (sum of orders from P1: 162, P2: 110, P4: 117). Since we have no inventory to sell yet, we need to maintain a robust base stock to cover the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean demand including the spike, and similarly for sigma to account for the high variance. L is kept at 'default' (4) as no actual lead counts are yet confirmed to differ.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-110.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (The Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). Inventory levels were zero for the first four periods, leading to lost sales, but stock arrived in Period 5 (162 units). Current demand has been quite volatile: 56, 106, 71, 198, and 26. The average demand across these 5 periods is 91.4. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of all samples (91.4) and L=4, the expected demand over the lead time plus current review period (mu_hat) would be 5 * 91.4 = 457. The current in-transit (377) plus on-hand (136) equals 513 units, which is slightly above the baseline requirement. However, the high standard deviation (std \u2248 68) suggests a buffer is needed. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to ensure the most recent volatile demand signals are captured but smoothed across all available data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-176.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and the Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand has been volatile: Periods 1-4 showed higher demand (avg ~107), while Periods 5-6 dropped significantly (avg ~30). Transitioning from a stock-out phase (Periods 1-4) to an overstock phase (On-hand: 211). With a high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the service level target q is 50%, meaning we want to carry exactly enough for the expected demand. Given the recent drop in demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend of the last 4 periods (198, 26, 35, and the current estimate for P7 based on P5-6 trend) while excluding the very early noise. This balances the high demand of P4 with the low demand of P5-6. L is set to default (4). Total pipeline (On-hand 211 + In-transit 267 = 478) is likely sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods given recent demand, so the backend OR will likely order 0 or very little to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P5 and P6 arrivals. Significant demand drop observed starting P5 (avg ~30 vs previous avg ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals confirmed this). Demand has shown a shift: Periods 1-4 had a mean demand of 107.75, while Periods 5-7 have dropped significantly to a mean of 51.33. Period 7 specifically saw a slight bounce-back to 93, but the 3-period trend remains lower than the start. With on-hand inventory at 118 and in-transit at 267 (orders from P4 and P5), our total pipeline is 385 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent_N (N=3) for demand captures the lower regime (mean ~51). 5 periods * 51 = 255 units needed. Our current pipeline (385) significantly exceeds this, so the OR backend will likely not place a new order. I will set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent overstocking, as holding costs ($1/unit) equal the profit per unit ($1/unit), making excess inventory very costly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-181.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P1, P2, and P4. A clear demand regime shift occurred at Period 5. The pre-shift average (P1-P4) was approximately 107.75 units per period. The post-shift average (P5-P8) is significantly lower at 45.25 units per period. Since this lower demand trend has persisted for 4 periods, I am shifting to recent_N (N=4) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the high initial demand. Current inventory is 208 on-hand + 150 in-transit (total 358), which significantly exceeds the projected demand for the next 5 periods (roughly 45 * 5 = 225), suggesting the OR engine will likely order 0 units this period to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5 confirmed: avg decreased from 107.8 to 45.3 (-58%) over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-288.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the inventory status for 'chips(Regular)' shows 323 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in historical concludes (P5, P6, P8, P9 all confirmed 4 periods). A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 5; the pre-P5 average was ~107.8, while the post-P5 average (P5-P9) is 43.2. Current on-hand inventory (323) is extremely high relative to recent demand (avg ~43), and with a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The inventory currently covers more than 7 periods of demand at the new rate, which exceeds the (L+1) coverage requirement of 5 periods (4+1). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and allow the OR engine to naturally deplete the excess stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 5. Prior to Period 5, demand averaged approximately 107.8 units; from Period 5 to Period 10, the average demand dropped to 43.16 units. The product description and calendar dates are generic, but the data clearly supports a lower demand environment. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With 280 units on-hand and an average demand of ~43 units per period, the current inventory covers approximately 6.5 periods of demand. This exceeds the target base stock level for a (L+1) window (4+1=5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are necessary to avoid unnecessary holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this lower demand regime for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 42 units with 0 units in-transit. A significantly high demand spike occurred in Period 11 (238 units), following a prolonged low-demand regime (avg ~30-40 units since Period 5). This spike in Period 11 suggests a possible regime shift or a one-off volatile event. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since current inventory (42) is much lower than the recent peak demand and we have no stock coming in for the next 4 periods, we need to order immediately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent low-demand regime while accounting for the Period 11 spike (Period 5-11). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the increased volatility introduced by the Period 11 outlier. The backend OR will compute a base stock level to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly at Period 11: single-period spike of 238 following a low-demand regime (avg ~45).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13. The history shows a significant demand regime shift at Period 11, where demand spiked from an average of ~45 (Periods 5-10) to 238 in Period 11 and 161 in Period 12. This spike has exhausted our on-hand inventory, leaving us with 0 units at the start of Period 13. We have 198 units in-transit (ordered P12, expected P16). The promised and observed lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5). To address the recent high demand and protect against stockouts during the lead time, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility (Demands: 43, 238, 161). This N=3 window covers the transition to the current high-demand state. For lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method as the historical lead times are reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Period 11-12 average demand is 199.5, compared to Period 5-10 average of 43.1. Inventory depleted to 0 as of Period 13.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a low-demand period (avg ~43 units from P5-P10), demand surged in P11 (238) and remained high in P12 (161) and P13 (121). The current average for this high-demand regime (P11-P13) is 173.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a large pipeline in-transit (507 units), including an order for 198 placed in P12 and 309 placed in P13. Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P12 order (placed at the start of P12) is expected to arrive during P16, and the P13 order during P17. Since the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to determine the base stock (covering L+1 periods), and L is consistently 4, we need to set demand parameters reflecting the high-demand state to ensure incoming orders meet future needs while accounting for the high volatility (+/- 60 units). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the 173.3 average, and explicit sigma_hat reflects the high variance seen in the spike.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed starting Period 11: current 3-period average is 173.3 units compared to previous ~43. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), the average demand is 159.25 units (238, 161, 121, 117), which is a massive increase from the previous average of ~43. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total in-transit pipeline of 779 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. The order placed in Period 12 (198 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 16. To ensure we have enough stock for the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high demand regime accurately. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand peak while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P11-P14) average is 159.3 units, compared to the P5-P10 average of 43.1. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting at Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the demand values are 238, 161, 121, 117, and 96, averaging 146.6. While the demand is trending slightly downwards from the initial spike, it remains significantly higher than the P5-P10 average (~43). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 13, on-hand inventory has been 0, and we have a large pipeline in-transit (797 units). We expect the P12 order (198 units) to arrive at the end of Period 16 (visible start of P17). To maintain service levels in this high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility, which provides an estimate based on the P11-P15 regime change.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P11-P15) average confirmed at 146.6 units, showing a sustained increase compared to the previous low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 11. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 11 has been: 238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99. This averages 138.7 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival in Period 16 (ordered P12). At Period 17, we have 99 units on-hand and 599 units in-transit (ordered P13: 309, P14: 272, P15: 18). These are expected to arrive in Periods 17, 18, and 19 respectively. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). A 6-period window (N=6) captures the entire current high-demand regime, providing a mean of 138.7. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 accurately reflects this high-demand scenario and the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-184.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P11-P17) shows a sustained increase with an average of approximately 134 units per period (samples: 238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99, 112). While there was a large initial spike, demand has stabilized between 96 and 112 in the last three periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across multiple checkpoints (P5, P6, P8, P9, P16, P17). Currently, there is 296 units on-hand and 290 in-transit (orders from P14 and P15), totaling 586 units against a pipeline requiring coverage for L+1 (5) periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1.0/1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing the P11 spike. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift P11-P17: mean ~134 units compared to prior low-demand regime (avg ~43). Lead time stability at 4 periods reaffirmed by P16 and P17 arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a 'High Demand' regime that began at Period 11. Demand from P11 to P18 has averaged approximately 128.6 units per period (238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99, 112, 85). Although the recent 3-period average (98.6) is lower than the initial spike, it remains significantly higher than the P5-P10 'Low Demand' average of 43.1. Inventory has recovered with arrival of large orders from P13 and P14, leaving 483 units on-hand. In-transit inventory consists of 18 units from P15 (due P19) and 89 units from P18 (due P22). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) captures the current regime mean without the distortion of the very low demand periods (P5-P10). Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 8 periods to reflect the heightened volatility (varying from 85 to 238) within this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-301.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-19) shows a consistent average of 125.4 units per period (1129 total demand / 9 periods). Although Period 11 was an outlier (238), the subsequent periods (P12-P19) have stabilized around a mean of 111.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 401 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the stockout phase in Periods 13 and 14. With in-transit stock of 143 units (from P18 and P19 orders), the pipeline is healthy. For Period 20, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods (consistent with history). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the higher demand regime starting from P11, and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to account for the volatility seen since that shift, while excluding the extreme P11 spike to avoid over-ordering given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P11-P19) mean is 125.4 units. Excluding P11 spike, the recent mean (P12-P19) is 111.4 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-20) shows a stabilized higher mean compared to the earlier periods. Specifically, following the initial spike in Period 11 (238 units), the average demand from Period 12 to 20 is approximately 114 units. Period 20 demand was 138 units, higher than the recent average but within expected variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is 263 units and in-transit is 227 units (sum = 490). With a lead time of 4 periods and the current period (L+1=5), we need to cover demand for approximately 5 periods. At an average of 114/period, we expect ~570 units of demand. The current pipeline (490) is slightly below this, and the backend capped policy will manage the order. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from P12, P13, P14, and P15. I will set N=9 for mu_hat (P12-P20) to reflect this stable 'new normal' demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P12-P20) with a mean of 114.3 units, significantly higher than the P5-P10 regime (~43) but lower than the initial P11 spike.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 12, following an initial spike in Period 11. For periods 12-21 (N=10), the average demand is 114.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 186 units, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 309 units, totaling 495 units. Given that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. A mean of ~114 units implies a base stock target of roughly 570 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently confirmed in P19). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand levels while ignoring the extreme outlier spike in Period 11, which would otherwise unnecessarily inflate safety stock.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a regime starting at Period 12, following the Period 11 spike. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P12-P22) is approximately 108.6 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P20-P22) showed demands of 138, 77, and 86, emphasizing a stabilization around the 100-110 range. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in Period 22 of the Period 18 order (4 periods). With an on-hand inventory of 189 and in-transit units of 278, the total pipeline is 467 units. This covers roughly 4.3 periods of the current demand mean. To ensure the base-stock levels (which target L+1 = 5 periods of demand) are accurately maintained by the OR backend, I will use a recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the stable regime since P12 (N=11). This length captures the current trend while discarding the highly atypical P11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P12-P22) with a mean of 108.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 12, following the significant spike in Period 11. Excluding that outlier, the mean demand from Period 12 to 23 (N=12) is approximately 103.9 units. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 22 and 23. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5, which essentially targets the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). My current on-hand inventory (190) and in-transit units (299) total 489 units. With an estimated demand of ~104 per period and a protection interval of 5 periods (L=4), the required base stock is roughly 520 units. I will set mu_hat based on the stable N=12 period regime to ensure the OR backend maintains this base stock level while accounting for the recent stability in both demand and lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P12-P23) with a mean of 103.9 units; volatility remains moderate compared to previous regimes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12-24) shows stabilization with a mean of approximately 103.5 units, following the initial high-demand spike in Period 11. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P20-P24) have an average demand of 90.6 units, indicating a slight cooling from the peak. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. For Period 25, I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat (covering the stable high-demand period P12-P24) and recent_N of 13 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while excluding the outlier spike of Period 11. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P12-P24) with a mean of 103.5 units; recent 5-period mean (P20-P24) is 90.6 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 12, following an initial spike in Period 11. Analysis of the most recent 14 periods (P12-P25) shows a mean demand of 100.0 units per period. The 5-period moving average (P21-P25) is slightly lower at 73.8 units, but the overall stabilized regime mean remains the safer benchmark for avoiding stockouts while balancing holding costs. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P22-P25). Consequently, I am setting L to the promised lead time (4) and anchoring mu_hat and sigma_hat on the stable demand regime since Period 12 (N=14). This results in a forecast that covers (1 + 4) = 5 periods of demand. With 203 units on hand and 260 in transit (total 463), and an expected 5-period demand (mu_hat) around 500, the system will place a moderate order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime Period 12-25: mean = 100.0 units, showing stabilization after the P11 spike. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 12, following the initial spike in Period 11. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (P12-P26) shows a mean demand of 99.5 units. Restricting this to the most recent 7 periods (P20-P26) to capture any late-stage drift shows a mean of 84.7 units, reflecting a minor cooling trend compared to the earlier parts of the regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully arrived shipments (P16, P17, P18, P19, P22, P23, P24, P25, P26 arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current inventory position includes 169 units on-hand and 239 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26), totaling 408 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A recent_N of 15 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust balance between capturing the current regime's characteristics and dampening short-term noise. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~100 unit/period consumption rate while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime stabilized further (P12-P26) with a mean of 99.5 units. Recent 7-period mean (P20-P26) is 84.7 units. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime following the spike in Period 11 and a subsequent high-demand period. For the window from Period 12 to 27, the mean demand is 97.4 units. More specifically, the recent 7-period average (P21-P27) is 76.7 units, and the 5-period average (P23-P27) is 74.8 units, indicating a slight downward trend or stabilization toward a lower level than the mid-100s seen earlier. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 16-19, 22-27. Based on the stabilization and the need to balance a 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target, though the OR backend will apply its specific logic), I will use a recent_N window of 16 (Period 12 onwards) to capture the stabilized regime while filtering out the initial Period 11 spike and the early chaos. This provides a balance between long-term stability and responsiveness to the current lower demand level (~75-80 units).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime Period 12-27: mean = 97.4 units. Recent 7-period mean (P21-P27) has softened to 76.7 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the spike in Period 11. Over the last 17 periods (P12-P28), the mean demand is 97.4 units. However, looking at the most recent 7 periods (P22-P28), the mean demand has softened further to 78.6 units (53, 99, 54, 92, 76, 90). The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 all matching the 4-period promise. On-hand inventory is currently 108 units with 292 in-transit, totaling 400 units of pipeline inventory. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it aims to stock the median demand over the (L+1) period window. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the most recent softened demand mean and variance while maintaining the default lead time setting of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P22-P28 has softened to a mean of 78.6 units, compared to the P12-P21 mean of 110.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, consistently confirmed by arrivals from P22-P25. Demand has entered a lower, more stable regime compared to the mid-game volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P21-P29), demand has averaged 80.1 units, significantly lower than the P12-P20 average of 114.3. Most recently (P25-P29), the 5-period average is exactly 79.2. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels in this lower-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 9 periods (P21-P29). This captures the recent softening while providing enough history to estimate variance accurately. The on-hand inventory (121) plus in-transit (195) equals 316 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of the current demand rate (~320 units), suggesting our current pipeline is well-aligned with the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P21-P29 has solidified at a lower mean of 80.1 units (down ~30% from the P12-P20 average of 114.3).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in periods 22-30. Demand has transitioned from a high-volatility regime (P11 spike) to a more stabilized, though recently softening, regime. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 82 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P27-P30) show a mean of 88 units. To avoid over-reacting to the softening while ensuring adequate service levels (Critical Ratio q = 0.5 as profit=holding cost), I will use the recent 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized demand level and volatility. On-hand inventory is 56 and in-transit is 237, totaling 293 units. With an expected lead time of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). A base stock based on a mean of ~82 would be around 410 units, suggesting the backend will place an order to bridge the 117-unit gap, subject to the safety stock and cap logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend, with Period 31 demand reaching 134 units, following a period of relative stability around 80-100 units. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P21-P31) is 89.2 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 11 units on hand and 258 units in transit (expected arrivals from P28-P31 orders), the goal is to maintain sufficient base stock (targeting 5 periods of demand coverage) to prevent stockouts while considering the recent demand spike. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution including the latest volatility, and keep lead time at the calculated average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P21-P31 has a mean of 89.2 units, showing a recent upward trend from the previous 80-unit average (Period 31 recorded 134 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown an increasing trend over the last two periods (P31: 134, P32: 80 but stockout-limited; P32 demand was likely higher as on-hand depleted to 0). The mean demand since P21 is approximately 89 units. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the need to protect against recent volatility (like the P31 spike), I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (P21-P32) to capture the stabilized yet slightly upward-trending demand regime (average ~89). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to prioritize recent volatility levels. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is accurately reflected by the 'calculate' method. This strategy ensures the base stock covers the 5-period risk window (lead time + review) while responding to the recent tightening of supply vs demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P21-P33) has stabilized with a mean of 90.7 units, showing a slight increase from the previous 80-unit average due to a spike in P31. Period 33 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 428 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is depleted and demand has shown some volatility (~90-100 units), I will set the demand parameters using recent_N (N=13, covering the stabilization since P21) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This should help the OR engine replenish stock to a level that accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the current demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P21-P33 stabilized with a mean of 90.7 units. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P34) shows a shift back to an elevated level, with a 4-period average of 95.75 units (134, 80, 100, 69). This is higher than the softened period (P21-P29) which hovered around 80. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 10 units on hand and 355 units in-transit, I need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining the stable lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P31-P34 has returned to a higher mean of approximately 96 units, rebounding from the P21-P29 softened mean of 80.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after a period of fluctuation. Recent demand from Period 31 to 35 (134, 80, 100, 69, 108) averages 98.2 units, which is consistent with the 'return to higher mean' noted in the carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization following the softer Period 21-29 period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 34 and 35. On-hand inventory is low (12), but arrivals are steady. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility roughly around 21 units (sqrt(L+1)*std_dev). The aim is to ensure base stock covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) based on the ~98 unit average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P31-P35 has stabilized at a mean of 98.2 units, confirming the rebound from the P21-P29 low.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following a slight rebound. Looking at the most recent periods (P31-P36), the demand mean is approximately 102.2 units, recovering from a brief dip in the 80s. The lead time is very stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment arriving since Period 5. On-hand inventory is currently low (34 units), and we have a robust pipeline of 355 units. To maintain the target service level given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each, implying a 50% critical fractile or matching the mean), I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods of stable demand (P31-P36) and use a recent window for volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current variance around this mean. This ensures the base stock (1+L)*demand is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P31-P36) with a mean of 102.2 units. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 31 to Period 37 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 99.1 units (134, 80, 100, 69, 108, 102, 88). This is a clear rebound from the Period 21-29 dip (~80 units) and aligns more closely with the long-term historical mean excluding the massive Period 11 spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37). Based on the most recent 7 periods of stable data (P31-P37), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current trend while filtering out the older, lower-demand period. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand at approximately 100 units/period, maintaining high service levels for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU which currently has low on-hand inventory relative to demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P31-P37) with a mean of 99.1 units. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a rebound from a mid-game dip. The most recent demand regime (Period 31-38) shows a mean of approximately 96.6 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 34-38. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a slight stockout in Period 38 where demand (90) exceeded starting on-hand + arrivals (67). With an 'In-transit' balance of 420 units (ordered Periods 35-38), we are positioned to recover stock as these arrive in Periods 39-42. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 31-38) to capture the current stable regime. Lead time is set to the promised 4 periods via the 'calculate' method which uses historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P31-P38) with a mean of 96.6 units and moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the recent period (P31-P39) with a mean of approximately 98.2 units and moderate volatility. The most recent observations (P38-P39) show demand slightly lower than the mean (90 and 71 units), but to ensure a high service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), I will use the established stable regime mean. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods, as confirmed by the continuous arrival of orders from P30 to P35 with exactly 4-period durations. Inventory management: Currently, on-hand is 43 units and there are 368 units in-transit. With L=4, the base stock targets demand over (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 98.2 = 491 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 411. The parameter settings should trigger an order of approximately 80 units to reach the target, though the capped policy may adjust this. I will set mu_hat to the recent 9-period mean (P31-P39) to reflect the stabilized demand rebound.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) with a mean of approximately 98.4 units. Period 40 saw a spike to 134, but the overall trend remains around 100. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the stabilized regime while accounting for the recent spike. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to reflect the current market volatility. On-hand inventory is low (29) with a substantial in-transit pipeline (305), so maintaining a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand is essential. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the order size, balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P31-P40 stabilized at a mean of 98.4 units with consistent 4-period lead times.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized between Period 31 and Period 41, with a mean of 98.4 units and moderate volatility. Historical lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the Period 37 order arriving in Period 41). Starting on-hand inventory is 18 units with 335 units in-transit. I will use the recent 11-period window (P31-P41) to capture the current demand level and volatility (mean: 100.3, std: 20.8). This ensures the base stock (calculated as \u03bc + z\u03c3) is tuned to the current stable regime while maintaining enough buffer for the observed variability, especially since we just saw a demand of 117 in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 31. The average demand from Period 31 to Period 42 is 100.8 units, which closely aligns with the long-term stabilization observed since the high-demand spike in Period 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Despite a stockout in Period 42 (on-hand is 0, sold 98 of 117 demanded), significant pipeline inventory (392 units) is due to arrive over the next four periods. Since the demand mean and variance have been stable for over 10 periods (P31-P42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this specific regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy covers (L+1) periods of demand accurately while maintaining a 50% service level target (as profit equals holding cost).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 31, with a mean demand of approximately 101.4 units over periods 31-43. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P31 through P39. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of stockouts (P42, P43) where demand exceeded supply. With 443 units in-transit (orders from P40-P43: 57+136+137+113), we expect 57 units to arrive during Period 44 (visible at P45 START). To maintain a proper base stock, I am using recent_N (N=13, from P31 to P43) to capture the current stable demand level and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the 100-unit average demand and recent fluctuations while acknowledging the reliable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P31-P43) with a mean of 101.4 units; volatility remains moderate. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 31. Analyzing the most recent data (P31-P44), the mean demand is approximately 100.8 units per period, while the more recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is 107.8 units, suggesting a slight uptick or higher volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P41, P42, P43, and P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand slightly outstripping arrivals, but there are 438 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level given the Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) imply a target cycle service level of 50% (q=0.5), the OR backend will set the base stock at the median. I will use recent_N (N=14, representing P31-P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for recent variability.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 31 to 45 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 101.4 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P41 arrival in Period 45). Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 units and in-transit inventory is 358 units. To ensure the OR engine maintains a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this stable period (N=15). This covers the demand window from P31 to P45, providing a robust estimate for the base stock calculation (1+L)*demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P31-P45 stabilized with a mean of 101.4 units; volatility is moderate and lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 31 to Period 46 has stabilized with a mean of 100.9 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), we must ensure enough inventory covers remaining demand while minimizing end-of-game excess. The current on-hand (105) plus in-transit (328) equals 433 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) is approximately 101 * 4 = 404 units. Since pipeline inventory (433) already covers the remaining forecast and the OR engine uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline from target, the backend should naturally taper orders or keep them low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable demand mean since Period 31 and 'default' for lead time as 4 periods constant.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized (P31-P47) with a mean of 100.2 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I am setting the lead time to the promised 'default' and using recent_N (N=17, covering P31-P47) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to maintain optimal service levels for the remaining stock on-hand and in-transit. The OR backend will automatically cap orders if unnecessary due to the high pipeline inventory (267 units) relative to remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P31-P47) with a mean of 100.2 units; lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 31-48) has stabilized around a mean of 100.2 units per period with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 44 order in Period 48. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units, but the pipeline (in-transit) is 351 units, which is sufficient relative to the expected demand across the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we are at Period 49 of a 50-period horizon, any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's end. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=18) to capture the stable regime starting at Period 31. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain the demonstrated stability of the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 31. Analyzing the most recent data segment (P31-P49, N=19), the mean demand is 98.9 units and the standard deviation is approximately 21.3 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P49 (ordered P45). With the current lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position is: On-hand (2) + In-transit (402) = 404 units. This covers roughly 4.1 periods of demand at the current rate (~100 units/period), suggesting a healthy but slightly tight pipeline. I will use the established regime (N=19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain balance between service level and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P31-P49 is stable with mean ~99 units and steady 4-period lead time.
