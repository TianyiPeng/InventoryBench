Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we only have historical demand data for 5 periods (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) and no information on actual lead time shifts or lost orders yet, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to set the demand forecast based on the full available history. This calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std, where L is the promised lead time of 4. This approach ensures the initial order accounts for the 5-period window (Review + Lead Time) required to cover demand until the first shipment arrives.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 151 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly reflected as 'In-transit'. Demand in Period 1 was 130, but with 0 on-hand inventory, sales were 0. The historical demand data provided (P1-P5) shows a mean of 104.4 and a standard deviation of 25.5. Since we only have one period of game history (Period 1 actual demand 130 vs provided P1 data 132), I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock. The OR backend will use the promised lead time (L=4) and calculate mu/sigma based on all five provided historical points to cover demand over the lead + review period (L+1=5). This is appropriate given the high unit profit ($1) relative to holding cost ($1), leading to a target service level q = 0.5, though the backend policy will ensure a buffer.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively (P1+4=P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts/lost sales in P1 and P2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first 5 historical periods (including the provided seed data) was 132, 74, 101, 90, 135. However, the last two concluded periods (P1, P2) show demands of 130 and 144. Averaging these (132, 74, 101, 90, 135, 130, 144) gives a mean of ~115. Acknowledging the promised lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the slightly higher recent activity while maintaining stability, and L=4 is the best estimate as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (N+L = 1+4), with confirmation visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing lost sales because no stock has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 463 units (151 from P1, 153 from P2, 159 from P3). Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including the provided seed data) shows a mean of 106.2. However, the game history for Periods 1-3 shows demand of 130, 144, and 105, averaging 126.3. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) from the game history as they are the most recent and relevant observations of the true demand process in the live environment. I will stick to the default lead time (promised L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (L=4). However, as of the start of Period 5, we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand from Periods 1-4 (totaling 489 units) due to stockouts. This is expected given the lead time. The historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.4. However, the game history provided for the first 4 periods shows demand of 130, 144, 105, and 110 (mean 122.25). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand to reflect the slightly higher recent levels observed in the conclude messages. Since no orders have concluded yet, L will remain at the promised 'default' of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on Period 5's conclusion, the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (Promised Lead Time = 4), confirming L=4. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [130, 144, 105, 110, 123], with a mean of 122.4. Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, and we have significant in-transit inventory (471 units from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the lead time is consistent and demand relatively stable, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current mean more accurately than a simple global average. The pipeline inventory (471) plus current stock (28) equals 499 units, which is intended to cover demand during the lead time (L) plus the current review period (1), i.e., 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~122, 5 periods would require ~610 units. The OR backend will order the difference to maintain the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of concluded periods confirms the lead time is exactly 4 (Order P1 arrived P5, Order P2 arrived P6). Demand history (P1-P6: 130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108) shows a mean of 120 and a standard deviation of 14.7. Using the critical timing definition, an order placed now (P7) will arrive in P11. Our decisions must cover demand for periods P7 through P11 (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline inventory is 431, and on-hand is 73. Expected arrivals for P7-P10 are from orders placed in P3, P4, P5, and P6. History shows orders were: P3=159, P4=159, P5=0, P6=113. Total units currently in-transit = 159+159+0+113 = 431, which matches the system status. Since demand is relatively stable with low variance, I will use all 6 available samples (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are calculated accurately against the pipeline. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Looking at the history (Periods 1-7), the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 arrived at P5, Period 2 at P6, Period 3 at P7). This confirms L=4. In-transit inventory is 368 units (orders from P4, P6, and P7), and on-hand inventory is 159. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73). However, given the initial provided samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) and the observed game history, the mean demand is roughly 108 units. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent observed behavior in the game while remaining responsive to the lower demand seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (consistently observed across P5-P7 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-56.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9. We have observed a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods across the last four arrivals (P5-P8), confirming the promised lead time of 4 is accurate. Historical demand for the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 115.5 units (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73, 131). The current pipeline consists of orders from P6 (113 units), P7 (96 units), and P8 (40 units), totaling 249 units in-transit. On-hand inventory is 187. With Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). Using L=4 (review + lead time = 5 periods), the expected demand over the horizon is 5 * 115.5 = 577.5 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 436 units. The backend will use these stats to bridge the gap. Given the demand is relatively stable but has some volatility (std dev ~22), I will use 'default' for lead time since 4 is confirmed, and 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full history) for demand and sigma to capture the baseline performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 8. No arrival was recorded in Period 9 (from Period 5's order of 0 units), which is expected. Current on-hand inventory is 79, with 391 units in-transit. Historical demand over 14 samples (9 observed + 5 provided) shows a stable mean. The average demand is approximately 107 units per period. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand. I will use the last 9 observed samples (N=9) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent stability. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 11. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, and now P10 arrivals all confirm L=4). Note: There was no order in Period 5, which explains why no arrival was expected/seen in Period 9. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 382) includes orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10. The demand remains fairly stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal trends visible from the generic 'Period_X' labels. The mean demand across all observed periods (P1-P10) is approximately 114.7 units. Using L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 114.7 = 573.5. Historically, the standard deviation is around 20.4, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 20.4 \u2248 45.6. Since demand is stable, I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' for statistics to maintain a balanced service level.

Note: The system successfully recovered order arrivals in Periods 10 and 11, confirming that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P6 arrived P10, P7 arrived P11). While there was an order placed in Period 5 of '0' units, the lack of an arrival in Period 9 was expected. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 11 periods showing a mean of approximately 112.5 units and a standard deviation of 20.8. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level is q = 0.5 (the median), meaning our base stock should aim for roughly the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full active history since start of operations to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use calculating for L to maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory and 14 units of lost sales (demand 136, sold 122). Demand remains variable but stable on average (~106.5 units). Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5 through P12). Current in-transit quantity is 441 units, which matches the sum of orders from P9 to P12 (142+104+101+94 = 441). Since we have 0 on-hand, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the next L+1 (5) periods. Using a recent_N approach (N=12) for demand mean and volatility helps capture the recent variability and the stock-out pressure without overreacting to the single period 12 spike. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the stable 4-period observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 13 (Period 9's order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 63, and there is a healthy pipeline of 431 units. Demand remains relatively stable but volatile. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has been [108, 115, 91, 136, 79], averaging 105.8 units per period. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which the OR engine's base-stock logic will target. Since the system is stable and the lead time is matching the promise, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to mirror the observed stability and 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=8 to capture the most representative recent behavior (post-initial startup phase). This N=8 covers Period 6 to Period 13, smoothing out the stockout effect observed in Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 15. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 60 units with 359 units in-transit. Demand has remained relatively stable since the start. Calculating the mean demand over the last 14 periods (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73, 131, 108, 115, 91, 136, 79, 107) gives an average of approximately 107.8 units per period. With L=4, the coverage required is for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 539 units. Pipeline inventory (359) + On-hand (60) = 419 units, which is slightly below the 5-period requirement, suggesting a need for a replenishing order. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage the stable history, and 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stable regime since Period 1.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 109 units over the first 15 periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals from P5 to P8 and P10 to P15. In Period 15, the inventory ended at 39 units. There is an in-transit pipeline of 397 units (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). Specifically: P12 order (94) is expected in P16, P13 (132) in P17, P14 (32) in P18, and P15 (139) in P19. The backend OR logic uses the formula base_stock = (1+L) * mu. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Given demand mean (~109) and std dev (~20), the base stock should be approximately 545. The total inventory (on-hand 39 + pipeline 397) is 436. The OR engine will order the difference (subject to the cap). I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the history consistently confirms 4 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stable history since no major regime shift is detected.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 16. Total pipeline inventory is 428 units (orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16), which aligns with the lead time. Demand for Period 16 was unusually low (41), contrasting with early historical samples (mean ~110). While Period 16's drop is significant, it is a single data point and does not yet constitute a sustained regime shift. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, where the OR engine aim to carry just enough stock to cover the mean demand. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~101 over last 10 periods) more heavily than the initial samples, while remaining robust to the single-period outlier in Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-52.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 13-17) shows a moderate downward trend compared to the initial periods, with an average of approximately 87 units/period vs. the long-term average of 106. In-transit inventory is 296, representing the orders from Periods 14, 15, and 16 (32 + 139 + 125 = 296), which aligns with the confirmed 4-period lead time. No order was placed in Period 17, and the current on-hand inventory is 138. To prevent overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~87, std ~21). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts observed in the last 18 periods (average demand is ~107 units). All completed orders show a consistent lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 41 units on-hand and 265 in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P15 (139), P16 (125), P18 (1), and the current P19 order. Total pipeline covers roughly 2.5 periods of demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which naturally leads the OR backend to aim for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (excluding the start-up phase) to capture the stable mean of ~105-110 units per period. I will keep L at default as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (e.g., Period 15 order arrived at Period 19 conclude). In-transit inventory is 274, consisting of orders from P16 (125), P18 (1), and P19 (148). Note that the P17 order was 0. Demand shows significant volatility but no clear structural trend, with recent demand being lower (41 in P19 and P16). Given equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid over-reacting to the recent low demand points while acknowledging the variance, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the last 10 periods (P10-P19), which include both high (136, 122, 129) and low (41, 41) demand values, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate around a stable mean. Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the average demand is 98.7 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (L+1). My current on-hand inventory is 131, and there are 210 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Total pipeline inventory is 341 units. The backend's critical ratio q = 0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1), which means it targets the median demand to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use the last 10 periods to capture current demand behavior while smoothing out the high variability seen in recent weeks (e.g., P19 demand 41 vs P20 demand 133).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 192 units, exhausting all on-hand inventory. The order from Period 17 was 0 units, so no arrival occurred in Period 21, which is consistent with the lead time of 4. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Pipeline inventory consists of 1 unit (from P18), 148 units (from P19), 61 units (from P20), and 142 units (from P21), totaling 352 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the history of arrivals (P13-P20). Demand shows high volatility recently (P19: 41, P20: 133, P21: 192), making it difficult to pinpoint a regime shift, but the 192 value suggests we should be prepared for higher consumption. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (mean=106.6) to capture the recent scale while smoothing the volatility, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the starting inventory was nearly zero (1 unit), and demand (97) significantly outpaced supply, resulting in a stockout. The shipment from Period 17 (ordered 0) effectively created a gap in arrivals at Period 21, and the small order from Period 18 (1 unit) arrived in Period 22, failing to meet demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 21, there has been a noticeable spike in demand (192 in Period 21, 97 in Period 22), compared to the earlier average of ~100. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent volatility and the potential upward trend, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the current period (L+1=5). This aggressive posture is necessary to recover from the current stockout and build safety stock against the observed high demand variance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows moderate fluctuation (mean \u2248 104 units over the last 20 periods), though stockouts occurred in P12, P21, and P22 due to uneven supply arrival and demand spikes. Specifically, the P17 order (ordered 0) likely contributed to the stockouts in P21-P22. The inventory position is currently recovering with an arrival of 148 units in P23 and a healthy pipeline of 444 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistently observed in P5-P8, P10-P20, and P22-P23), though the P17 shipment was for 0 units and P21 saw no arrival because the P17 order was 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand to capture recent mean and volatility trends while smoothing out the noise from the stockout periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-146.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but maintains a stable mean. Recent history shows a notable stockout in Period 22 due to the Period 17 order (which would have arrived in P21) being lost or skipped (the history shows Period 17 ordered 0, but Period 18 ordered 1 and arrived in P22). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on all successful arrivals (excluding the P17 skip). Demand in Period 24 was 0, which is likely an outlier or a specific quiet interval. Given Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand (mu_hat). I will use recent_N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while smoothing out the Period 24 outlier. L is set to calculate as 4 is the established actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains volatile but centered around an average of approximately 100-110 units. Recent periods show a specific pattern: a spike in Period 25 (155 units) and a significant drop in Period 24 (0 units), suggesting variability that must be accounted for. The Lead Time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 133 units, with a significant amount in-transit (241 units), including the large order of 181 units from Period 22 expected to arrive in Period 26. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand. Given the recent variability and the stockout in Period 21-22, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=10) to capture the current demand mean and standard deviation, ensuring the system remains responsive to recent shifts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-272.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently high at 293 units due to a combination of 181 units arriving from Period 22 and an extremely low demand of 21 units in Period 26. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been volatile, averaging approximately 100 units per period, but showing significant fluctuations (ranging from 0 to 192). Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26: 192, 97, 63, 0, 155, 21) averages 88 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this recent variability and average. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect the recent high volatility. Given the high on-hand (293) and in-transit (155) inventory totaling 448 units, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of average demand, the OR backend will likely minimize new orders this period to manage holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-263.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently high at 308 units, while recent demand has been volatile, dropping significantly in Period 26 (21 units) and Period 27 (45 units). A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on history. With the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5 (since Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0), the OR backend will aim for a base stock near the median (z* = 0). The pipeline inventory includes 95 units ordered in Period 26. Given the high on-hand stock and recent low demand, I am using a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 23-27: 63, 0, 155, 21, 45) to capture this downward shift in demand (mean ~57), which will prevent the OR engine from over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 is chosen to respond to this recent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-128.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility without a clear sustained trend shift, though there was a brief period of low demand (Periods 24, 26, 27). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P19-P28) is approximately 84.5 units, which is lower than the overall historical average of ~102. Current inventory levels are high (On-hand: 218, In-transit: 95, Total: 313). With a lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 focuses on the more recent, slightly lower demand data to prevent excessive inventory accumulation, while sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=10 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so method 'default' is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-136.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains volatile but relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend identified in the period labels. The average demand across all periods is approximately 96 units, though recent periods (P24-P29) show a slightly lower average. However, P21 and P25 saw spikes (>150), suggesting we should maintain a robust buffer. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals up to P27). Orders from P24 and P25 were 0 units, and P28 was also 0, which explains the lack of arrivals in the 'conclude' messages for P28 and P29. The order from P22 (181 units) arrived in P26, and P23 (60 units) arrived in P27. We are currently holding 177 units on-hand with 201 units in-transit (from P26 and P29). To maintain readiness for potential spikes like those seen in P21/P25/P26 while respecting the $1.0 holding cost, I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach to capture the current demand variance and mean effectively. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period average.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the history (e.g., Period 30 arrival from Period 26 order). Current inventory is 96 units on-hand with 147 units in-transit (orders from P29 and P30). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but generally averages around 100-110 units. Recent periods have seen cycles of high demand (P30: 176, P25: 155, P21: 192) and very low demand (P24: 0, P26: 21). I will use L=4 (calculated) to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 15 to capture the average demand including the more volatile late-game behavior (approx 100 units/period, so total 500 for L+1). I will use default sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in recent periods, which helps maintain a buffer during high-demand spikes.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows high demand volatility (sigma levels are significant) but no clear seasonal trend at this period based on the history. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-30, with Period 21 ordering 142 and arriving in Period 25). Currently, we are at 0 on-hand inventory with 305 units in-transit (orders from P29: 106, P30: 41, P31: 158). Using a lead time of 4 means we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand across all periods is approximately 100. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 92, while older demand (P1-P20) averages 105. There is no sustained shift, so I will use a larger sample (N=20) for mu and sigma to capture recent volatility while smoothing noise.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but remains around a mean of 100 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to 101 demand in P31 and 135 demand in P32, with the last arriving shipment having been in P30. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of history confirms that orders consistently arrive with a 4-period lead time (e.g., P26 order arrived in P30). Currently, in-transit inventory consists of orders from P29 (106), P30 (41), P31 (158), and P32 (159), totaling 464 units. The P29 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 33 resolution. To maintain a sufficient base stock (targeting L+1 periods of demand coverage), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the broad average demand while smoothing recent spikes. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=20 to account for the observed variance. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and confirmed.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing stockouts due to high demand and the 4-period lead time delay. Demand has remained relatively high, with the most recent observed demand at 147 units. The 4-period lead time is consistent (as seen in Period 33's arrival from Period 29). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit units total 358 (from orders in periods 30, 31, 32). An order from Period 30 (41 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 34. To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 10 periods to capture the current variability, while keeping L at the promised default of 4, which aligns with observed history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase compared to the early periods. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand has risen to approximately 107.8 units, compared to the overall average of ~102. Recent peaks (P30: 176, P33: 147, P34: 167) suggest a higher volatility and potential upward trend. Concurrently, the inventory state is currently critical with 0 on-hand inventory and stockouts occurring in the last four periods (P31-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P33 and P34). Given the inventory shortage and rising demand, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure the base stock levels are high enough to mitigate the ongoing stockouts. Setting the lead time method to 'calculate' ensures we use the consistent observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 30: Average demand increased and volatility spiked, leading to persistent stockouts.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with average demand increasing and becoming more volatile (mean demand periods 30-35 is ~143, vs. prior average ~90). This has led to repeated stockouts. The carry-over insights confirm that lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 27 and a significant in-transit pipeline (381 units), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this higher demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the shift since Period 30, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the current regime while maintaining some stability in the estimate.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with average demand increasing significantly and becoming more volatile. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), mean demand is approximately 134.7, up from the historical average of approximately 100. The current on-hand inventory is 100, and there are 456 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 34, 35, and 36 (+ a possible order from P33, though it was 0). To stabilize the service level during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher average and increased volatility since Period 30, with a recent mean of approximately 137 units per period and a standard deviation reflecting higher peaks (up to 192). Period 37 ended with 0 inventory despite arrivals, as demand outpaced stock. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 36 arrival). To address the recent stockouts and ensure adequate coverage for the review+lead time window (1 + 4 = 5 periods), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) to capture the higher demand average (~137 * 5 = 685). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to account for the increased variance. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with demand becoming more volatile and averaging approximately 118 units over the last 9 periods (P30-P38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by recent arrivals (P34 order arriving in P38). Currently, there are 92 units on hand and 612 units in transit (ordered in P35, P36, P37, and P38). Given the high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 62) and the need to prevent the stockouts observed in earlier periods of this regime, I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture this higher demand and variance. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that covers the review period and lead time (1+4=5 periods), balancing the unit profit against the holding cost, which are equal in this case ($1.0).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 30, characterized by higher mean demand and increased volatility (multiple stockouts observed). Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 114 units per period (N=10), compared to the earlier periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 135 units with 488 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility in the recent regime (Standard Deviation approx 55), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the updated mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for this newer regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that accounts for the higher sustained demand and protects against the observed volatility to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 30-40) shows a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the early game, though there were significant stockouts and some very low demand points (e.g., Period 38 saw demand of 6). The average demand from P30 to P40 is approximately 117 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (311 units) due to a large arrival of 234 units in Period 40. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand (311) and in-transit (254) totals 565 units, which covers roughly 4.8 periods of demand at the recent average of 117. To maintain service levels while accounting for the recent regime shift but avoiding excessive holding costs from the current inventory surge, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the demand mean and volatility from Period 30 onwards.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-263.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and periodic spikes since Period 30. Recent demand samples show a mix of high and low values (e.g., 192 in P37 and 6 in P38), with an average around 100-110 units per period over the last 10 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 41. We are currently in Period 42 with on-hand inventory of 346 and in-transit inventory of 153. To manage the service level (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0, implying a 50% target service level in a standard Newsvendor context, but the OR backend uses q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the post-shift regime (since Period 30), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same N to account for the heightened volatility. The lead time parameter L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the stable historical observation of 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and a downward trend in the most recent periods (P38-P42: 6, 81, 58, 83, 13). However, the carry-over insight from Period 35 warns of a shift that started around Period 30 where volatility spiked. Looking at the window from Period 30 to 42, demand remains erratic. I will use a recent_N of 13 (covering the period since the last known regime shift at P30) to provide a localized estimate of mean and standard deviation. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 469 and in-transit at 86 (total 555 units), and the recent demand average being lower than previous peaks, the system is currently well-stocked. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the confirmed lead time, while mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 capture the post-shift behavior.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and a shift in mean since Period 30. While the carry_over_insight for Period 35 noted a spike, the most recent 5-10 periods (P34-P43) show high variation (demands of 167, 131, 86, 192, 6, 81, 58, 83, 13, 137). The current on-hand inventory is high (332) due to large orders from the previous regime spike arriving together. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the fact that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend needs to balance service levels carefully. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering Period 30 onwards) to capture this high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while maintaining the established lead time of 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory level is currently high (332 units on-hand) due to recent low demand (Period 42: 13, Period 44: 0). However, history shows that 'chips(Regular)' experiences high volatility and periodic spikes (e.g., Period 30-35). Since the game is nearing its end (Period 45 of 50), the primary goal is to maintain a sufficient service level without over-ordering and incurring holding costs for units that won't sell. Demand regime analysis since Period 30 shows an average demand of approximately 102 units per period but with a very high standard deviation (approx 68). I will use a recent_N approach for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 15 periods (since Period 30) to capture this higher volatility regime while allowing the high current on-hand inventory to naturally buffer against immediate need. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited significant volatility since the regime shift noted around Period 30. Recent demand samples show values ranging from 0 to 163 (P44: 0, P45: 163, P43: 137, P42: 13, P41: 83). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 41 order in Period 45. Currently, on-hand inventory is 186 units with 192 units in-transit (Orders from P42, P44). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which aligns with basing decisions on the mean. To capture the recent high volatility and the mean shift, I will use a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) looking at the last 15 periods (since Period 30). This allows the model to adjust to the higher variance observed in the second half of the game while maintaining sufficient inventory to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

chips(Regular): ordered=122, arrived=69 units (ordered on Period 42, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=255, demand=64, sold=64, ending on-hand inventory=191

Daily Reward (R_t): $-127.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and alternating periods of high and zero demand since Period 30, likely indicating a change in the consumer purchasing cycle or promotional impact. The current on-hand inventory is 191 units, and there are 245 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 44 and 46). Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 47 of 50, we need to ensure enough stock covers the final 4 periods without overstocking and incurring high holding costs (which match the profit per unit). The last 12 periods (P35-P46) show an average demand of approximately 77 units per period, but with a wide range (0 to 192). Using a recent window (N=12) captures this increased variance and current mean more accurately than the full history. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method, and use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the post-Period-35 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 30, with demand frequently fluctuating between 0 and 192. Looking at the last 15 periods (P33-P47), the mean demand is approximately 83 units per period, but the high variance necessitates a sufficient base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (66) and in-transit units (245) total 311. Our pipeline needs to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 15 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current higher-volatility regime (since P30) while smoothing out the extreme zeros and peaks seen in recent weeks (e.g., P42-P44). This recent window reflects the current demand behavior better than the full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 49. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 30, demand has shifted into a higher-volatility regime with a higher mean. Analyzing the last 19 periods (since P30), the average demand is approximately 102 units/period, but with significant swings (0 to 192). The inventory on-hand is 133, with 296 units in transit (ordered in P45-P48). As we are near the end of the simulation (P49 of 50), the goal is to ensure demand for the remaining periods (P49 and P50) is met while minimizing ending inventory. The pipeline and current stock are sufficient to cover the remaining periods given the current average. I will use recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift behavior, and retain L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 49 (demand 148, sold 133). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 30, demand has exhibited higher volatility and a slightly higher mean compared to the initial periods. Calculating the demand statistics from the regime shift (last 20 periods, N=20) captures this increased variance while smoothing out the noise from the stockout periods. Setting L to 'calculate' (which defaults to 4 based on history) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 provides the OR backend with a localized estimate of demand across the review and lead time window (5 periods total), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the current demand regime's volatility without excessive holding costs.
