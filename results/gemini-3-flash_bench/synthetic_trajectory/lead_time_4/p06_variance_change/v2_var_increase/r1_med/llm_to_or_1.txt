Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no lead time history yet, I will use the default method for L. The demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 5 samples: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135. The mean of these samples is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Since there is no obvious trend or seasonality in just 5 samples, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the full historical window to calculate the base-stock levels. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*106.4 = 532 and sigma_hat accordingly. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8, which the OR backend will use to calculate the safety stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5. The starting on-hand inventory was 0, resulting in 99 units of lost demand in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 132, 74, 101, 90, 135 (avg ~106). Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will stick to the default lead time (4) and use the average demand of all samples to stabilize the base stock calculation, ensuring we cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand. The OR backend will calculate the order needed to reach the target base stock, accounting for the 151 units already in-transit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. The demand samples provided are [132, 74, 101, 90, 135]. Note that the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 show demand 99 and 63 respectively, which differ slightly from the provided sample list [132, 74], but both sets suggest an average demand around 100 per period. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand across 5 samples is 106.4. I will use 'default' for L (promised) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local average while we wait for stock to arrive and more lead-time data to materialize.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 437 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable, though lower than the provided pre-game samples (Avg P1-P3: 76 vs Avg Pre-game: 106). Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time. I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the actual observed demand periods (P1-P3) more heavily than the pre-game estimates, as the current environment shows a lower demand trend.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 437 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first 4 periods averaged 77.75 units, while the provided historical samples for P1-P5 average 106.4 units. Given the stockout (sold=0 due to 0 on-hand), the backend needs to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the average of all available demand samples (106.4) to forecast mu_hat and the standard deviation to set sigma_hat. Since we have not yet seen any arrivals to verify actual lead time, I will remain with the default promised lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order placed in Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time is currently accurate. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [132, 74, 101, 90, 135] (mean: 106.4, std: 25.5). Note: The game history 'demand' figures in the 'conclude' section reflect the resolution of that period's demand, while the 'Historical Demand Data' section provided in the prompt shows slightly different historical samples [132, 74, 101, 90, 135]. I will use the prompt's provided 'Historical Demand Data' samples as they represent the full demand experienced. Current on-hand is 86, with a significant pipeline of 367 units (orders from P2, P3, and P5). Since we have enough data to establish a baseline and the lead time is confirmed as 4, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available samples and the promised lead time. This will set a base stock level to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory effectively.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived at the end of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 79.17 units per period (samples: 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and recent 'conclude' messages (P5 and P6) confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 132 units, with 273 units in-transit (orders from P3, P5, and P6). Since the 'In-transit' reflects the pipeline including the most recent order, we must ensure our base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient. With an average demand of ~80, the 5-period requirement is ~400 units. Current total position (on-hand 132 + in-transit 273) is 405 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5) and 'default' for lead time to maintain this steady state, as there are no seasonal indicators or regime shifts yet detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106], showing a mean of approximately 83 units per period. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrivals of orders from P1, P2, and P3 in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Currently, we have 167 units on-hand and 133 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7). Our pipeline inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time window given the current mean demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the observed values match the promised 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the last 7 samples (recent_N=7) to capture the current stable demand regime while ignoring the initial samples if they drift. This balances service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $658.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are at a critical juncture. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent with historical observations (P1-P3 orders arrived in P5-P7). No order was placed in P4, which explains why 'arrived=0' in Period 8 conclude. We expect the P5 order (81 units) to arrive during P9 and be visible in P10. Demand has shown a significant uptick in P8 (165 units) compared to the previous average of ~90. This might be a rogue peak or a new regime. Given the low on-hand inventory (2 units) and high demand last period, I will adjust forecast parameters to be more responsive. I'll use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent trend including the P8 spike, and for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. The lead time L will be set to 'calculate' as the history confirms the promised 4 periods is accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 8 (demand=165, previous avg ~90); monitoring if this is a sustained regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The promised lead time of 4 periods appears consistent (orders from Period 1, 2, 3, and 5 all arrived with L=4). However, demand has shifted significantly upward starting in Period 8. The average demand across Periods 1-7 was approximately 83 units. Periods 8 and 9 showed 165 and 133 units respectively, suggesting a new demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this higher demand level (avg ~130/period) and setting L to 4 to align with observed performance. With 344 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9), the OR backend needs to maintain a target level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) based on this higher demand to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8: Average demand increased from ~83 to ~130 (+56%) based on a 3-period trailing average (P8: 165, P9: 133, P10: current context).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at a zero on-hand inventory state due to a sustained demand surge that began in Period 8. The average demand for the last three periods (P8-P10) is approximately 137 units, significantly higher than the earlier average of ~83 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a high-demand regime, our base stock calculation must reflect the recent higher mean and increased volatility to recover service levels. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (P8 onwards) and set L to default as the promised lead time of 4 is currently accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~83 to ~137 (+65%) across P8-P10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12. Analysis of the order history and carry-over insights confirms a demand regime shift starting at Period 8. The mean demand for the first 7 periods was approximately 83. Since Period 8, demand has averaged 126.25 (165, 133, 114, 93), marking a sustained increase of approximately 52%. However, the last two periods (P10 and P11) observed a slight cooling in demand volatility. Regarding supply, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P5, P6, and P7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand spike outpacing previous low-volume orders. To recover service levels while acknowledging the higher demand floor, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean shift since P8. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is set to calculated to maintain the confirmed 4-period window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. The promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with observation (P8 order arrived at P12). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 575 units in transit. Demand underwent a significant regime shift around Period 8; the average demand from Period 8-12 is 127.8 units, compared to an earlier average of ~83. Recent demand values are: P8: 165, P9: 133, P10: 114, P11: 93 (a slight dip), P12: 134. Over these 5 periods, the mean is 127.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 26. Since the shift is sustained (5 periods), I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility. Note that currently P9, P10, and P11 orders (178, 184, 180 units respectively) are the bulk of the pipeline and are expected to arrive in P13, P14, and P15. Setting parameters to reflect this new baseline ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock for the (L+1)=5 period lead time protection window.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 8 has continued, with demand averaging approximately 126 units over the last 6 periods (P8-P13), up from the historical average of ~83 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 59 units, and there are 512 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple historical observations (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9 all arrived with exactly a 4-period delay). To stabilize the service level after several periods of stockouts (P9-P12), I will center the demand forecast on this more recent, higher-demand regime. Using N=6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 8-13) provides a target demand of ~126 units per period. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility observed since Period 8. This configuration ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher mean and variance.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, increasing from an initial average of ~83 to a new level. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P8-P14), the mean demand is approximately 124.1 (165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119, 111). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Current on-hand inventory is 132 units with 435 units in transit (ordered in P11, P12, P13, P14). To manage the current regime (N=7), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the stable observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand characteristics of the new regime while ignoring the lower historical pre-shift demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P8-P14 is ~124, compared to ~82 for P1-P7.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. Period 15 concluded with the arrival of the Period 11 order (180 units), confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 246 units. The demand regime shifted at Period 8; while the average for the high-demand period (P8-P14) was ~124, Period 15 saw a significant drop to 66 units. This could be a return to earlier levels or a temporary fluctuation. Given the previous stabilization around 124, I will use a window (recent_N=8) that covers the higher demand regime (P8-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't overreact to a single low-demand observation while acknowledging the shift. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 8 has stabilized. Comparing the early periods (P1-P7, avg ~82) to the current regime (P8-P16, avg ~117), there is a clear upward shift in volume. The most recent demand (P16: 115) align with this new average. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 164 with 361 units in-transit. Since the lead time is steady at 4, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering Period 8 to Period 16) to capture the statistics of the current demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher mean and volatility without being skewed by the lower demand seen in the first seven periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, increasing from an average of ~82 to ~115 units per period. The most recent demand samples (P15-P17) show a stabilizing trend around this new mean (66, 115, 118). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P13 order arrived in P17). I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand period (P1-P7). This N covers P8-P17. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent historical lead-time data (4 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~114 units per period following the regime shift at Period 8 (P8-P18 mean = 114.5). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 226, and there are 365 units in-transit. A 4-period lead time requires covering a 5-period window (L+1). Using the last 11 samples (P8-P18) provides a more accurate representation of the current demand regime than the full history, as the early periods (P1-P7 mean ~82) are significantly lower. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 aligns the base-stock levels with current consumption patterns and high service level requirements (q=0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift since Period 8. While an earlier regime shift (P8-P11) saw averages spike to ~137, more recent activity (P15-P19) shows a slight cooling with demand values of 66, 115, 118, 42, and 76 (average ~83). This suggests higher volatility than the initial periods, despite the mean returning closer to historical levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 247 and in-transit at 290, the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=12 to capture the full scope of the elevated regime starting at Period 8, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the spike and the recent moderation. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=12 to reflect the increased variance observed in this period. This approach maintains a safe service level while preventing excessive overstocking as demand appears to be stabilizing.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift since Period 8. While Period 15 insights suggested a mean of ~124 for the P8-P14 window, the most recent volume (P15-P20) shows higher volatility and an average of approximately 103 units. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P18-P20) was 42, 76, and 150 respectively. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (139) and a substantial pipeline (310), the system needs to prevent overstocking while covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use a recent N=13 to capture the post-shift regime starting from Period 8, providing a balanced forecast of the higher-mean environment compared to the initial periods. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased variance observed recently (e.g., the jump to 150 in P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift that occurred around Period 8, which was previously noted in the carry-over insights. Looking at the last 14 periods (P8-P21), the mean demand is approximately 110 units per period, but recent volatility is high (P20: 150, P21: 114). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclude messages (e.g., P17 order arrived at the end of P21). To set the base stock level, I am using L=4 and recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the behavior of the current demand regime. With on-hand inventory at 136 and in-transit at 366 (total coverage 502), and assuming a mean expectation of ~110 over the 5-period horizon (L+1), the current pipeline is healthy. The backend will use these parameters to maintain a service level determined by the profit and holding cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering during periods of high variance.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift since Period 8. While Period 15's insight noted a mean of ~124, recent demand from Period 19 to 22 has been more volatile (76, 150, 114, 41), averaging 95.25. However, since the post-Period 8 regime (P8-P22) persists with higher peaks (reaching 165), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the full scope of this higher-demand regime while allowing for recent variability. The Lead Time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 210 and 365 in-transit, we are well-covered for the 5-period window (L+1), but mu_hat and sigma_hat need to reflect the regime's higher mean and standard deviation to maintain the target service level (q = 0.8) and avoid stockouts during demand spikes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a high degree of variability after the regime shift originally detected at Period 8. While Period 8-14 averaged ~124 units, the subsequent periods 15-23 have seen a mix of high demand (P20: 150) and significantly lower demand (P18: 42, P22: 41, P23: 56). This sugiere a potential cooling of demand or higher volatility in the current phase. The average demand across the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is approximately 89 units. Given the in-transit inventory is 367 units (covering roughly 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate) and on-hand is 176 units, we are in a relatively healthy position. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P19 order arrived P23). I will use a 10-period lookback window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent fluctuation and avoid over-ordering based on the earlier Period 8-14 peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but average demand has softened from the P8-P14 peak (~124) to a lower average over P14-P23 (~89).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. Following a high-demand regime (P8-P14 avg ~124), the current regime (P15-P24) exhibits a lower average demand of approximately 88 units per period (P15:66, P16:115, P17:118, P18:42, P19:76, P20:150, P21:114, P22:41, P23:56, P24:150), though volatility remains high. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 88 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 305 units (covering orders from periods 21-23), the total inventory position is 393. Given the Lead Time (L=4) plus the decision period itself (Review=1), the target stock should cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. At an average of 88/period, the expected demand is 440 units. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this current softened demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering as we return closer to baseline levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 25: Mean demand for P15-P24 is ~88, showing a decrease from the previous peak of ~124 (P8-P14).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P15 onwards) has stabilized at a lower average of ~88 units per period compared to the earlier spike period. Current demand samples for P15-P25 are: 66, 115, 118, 42, 76, 150, 114, 41, 56, 150, 83. The mean of these 11 samples is 91.9, and the standard deviation is approximately 40.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With stock on-hand (172) and in-transit (288), totaling 460 units, we are currently well-covered (approx 5 periods of demand). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples to reflect this recent regime while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently with a demand value of 167 in Period 26. While a previous regime shift to a lower average (~88\u201389) was observed between Periods 15\u201324, the last two periods (P25: 83, P26: 167) show significant variance. Given this volatility, I will use a recent window (N=11, covering Periods 16-26) to capture the current mean and standard deviation, reflecting both the softer baseline and the recent spikes. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by actual arrival data). By using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will adjust for the current period's demand level and volatility while maintaining the stock levels necessary to handle the high-end demand spikes (~150-167) seen periodically.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P27: 83, 167, 52) averages approximately 100.7 units, showing continued high volatility but a mean that aligns with the softened regime noted since Period 24. Inventory management is currently healthy with 91 units on-hand and 400 in-transit. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all past deliveries. To account for the recent demand volatility while acknowledging the moderate average, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (P18-P27) which captures the current stabilized regime (average ~88-100). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to reflect the current high variance (std ~45). This approach helps the OR backend compute a base stock that covers the expected 5-period cycle (L+1) while protecting against the observed demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). The most recent demand sample was 113. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 113, which is higher than the average identified in P25 (~88). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since P28 shows an arrival of 0 units (P24 order was 0), and P29's decision phase occurs before P25's arrival (ordered 150), we must ensure the pipeline covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods. The current pipeline is 466 units (P25-P28 orders: 150+75+175+66), which should arrive in the coming periods to resolve the stock-out. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the current demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent uptick in demand from ~88 back towards ~113.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand for P24-P28 increased to ~113, returning towards levels seen in the P8-P14 window (+28% from P15-P24 average).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant recent increase. While the average demand during Periods 15-24 was approximately 88 units, the average from Period 25-29 has spiked to roughly 141 units (including 188 in P29 and 167 in P26). This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from P29 regarding a return to high-demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently strained, with an on-hand balance of 0 following a stockout in Period 29. The OR backend needs to account for this higher demand regime and the associated volatility to prevent further stockouts. I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this latest surge while using sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened variance during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed and intensified: Mean demand for P25-P29 increased to 140.6 units (+60% from the P15-P24 average of 88), with individual peaks reaching 188 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-mean regime starting at Period 25. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 111.5, but the individual levels are highly unpredictable (ranging from 52 to 188). Period 30 saw 66 units of demand, but the preceding periods were significantly higher. Given the date (Period 31), we are in a sustained high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the ending on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) and demand has peaked recently at 188, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current regime's volatility and mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a high service level to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 28 and 29 while managing the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P25 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 111.5 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~55) compared to the previous period's average of ~88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P31) shows an average demand of approximately 111.5 units, which is a significant increase from the P15-P24 average of 88. However, the volatility remains high (standard deviation ~55), and the most recent period (P31) saw demand of 92 units, following a volatile sequence (83, 167, 52, 113, 188, 66, 92). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P27 order in P31. I will use a recent window (N=7, covering P25-P31) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the elevated mean while accounting for the high coefficient of variation to maintain service levels during this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 25. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P25-P32), mean demand is approximately 115.75 units with significant volatility (Std Dev ~48). The current on-hand inventory is low (23), and while there is a large in-transit pipeline (482), the demand has been unpredictable. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-demand regime while excluding the older, lower-demand data from Periods 15-24. Setting L to calculate is safe given the stability of the observed lead times.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P25) has stabilized at a higher mean compared to the P15-P24 dip. Over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), mean demand is approximately 111 units with a standard deviation around 46, though individual periods fluctuate between 52 and 188. Looking at the transit pipeline: the order from P28 arrived in P32, and the order from P29 arrived in P33, confirming lead time remains exactly 4 periods. Currently, 440 units are in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33), and on-hand inventory is 96. Total inventory position is 536. Based on an average demand of 111, the pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of demand (111 * 4.8), which is appropriate for the (L+1) window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this current high-volatility regime and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility but has shown a downward trend over the last few periods (P31: 92, P32: 135, P33: 115, P34: 52). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 111.4 units, which is consistent with the regime shift identified in the carry-over insights at Period 31. Inventory management must balance this high variance (std dev ~46 over the last 10 periods) against the lead time. Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 250 units, and there are 345 units in-transit, which covers expected demand for the immediate lead time periods. I am using recent_N=10 for both demand and volatility to capture the characteristics of this current regime (post-P24). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P25) is characterized by high volatility, ranging from 52 to 188 units. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P25-P35) is approximately 107.5 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P31-P35), the average has cooled significantly to 89.8 units (92, 135, 115, 52, 55). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 213 units on hand and 352 units in transit (ordered in P32-P35), the pipeline is well-stocked relative to recent demand. I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime and provide a buffer against potential spikes, while acknowledging the recent dip. This window covers the period from P26 to P35, which has an average demand of ~108.9. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the current volatility (std dev ~53).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 continues to show high volatility (50-190 range) but has seen lower demand in the most recent 5 periods (avg ~90 vs regime avg ~108).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P25) is characterized by high volatility but has shown a softening trend in the most recent 12 periods (P25-P36), with an average demand of approximately 102.5 units compared to the global mean. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P32-P36) have averaged 94 units. Given this softening trend following the P29-P30 peaks, I am setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the lower average demand. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple concludes including the most recent arrival (P32 order arriving at P36). With 170 on-hand and 327 in-transit, we have sufficient safety stock relative to the current demand trend.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to show high volatility, a characteristic of the regime that started around Period 25. While there was a brief softening in demand, the most recent samples (P36: 113, P37: 137) suggest demand is oscillating within the broader regime's range. Since Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 107 units with a standard deviation near 48. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 179 and in-transit at 282, the total pipeline is 461. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). A base stock aimed at covering ~535 units (5 * 107) plus a safety buffer for the high volatility is appropriate. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at P25) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent regime shifts. Since the shift identified at Period 25, demand has fluctuated significantly. Over the last 14 periods (P25-P38), the mean demand is approximately 109.5 units. However, looking at the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38), the mean is slightly higher at 116 units with a high standard deviation (approx. 49). Current on-hand inventory is healthy (228 units) following a low demand period (62 units), and there are 319 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, P38). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To account for the high volatility and recent demand levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current 116-unit average, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the full volatility of the current regime since P25. This ensures the service level remains high enough to cover potential spikes without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $667.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, with recent demand jumping to 184 units in Period 39. Over the last 15 periods (since the regime shift identified around P25), the mean demand is approximately 106 units with a high standard deviation (approx 47). This volatility necessitates a robust buffer. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 69, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 337. I will use the recent 15-period window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while adapting to the sustained volatility seen since P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that started at Period 25. Average demand over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) is approximately 117 units, but the most recent 2 periods (P39-P40) saw a significant surge (184 and 156 units respectively), leading to a stockout at the end of Period 40. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 478 units in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (q=0.8), and we must ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover demand during the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean of the current regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This N choice balances the long-term regime average (~108-117) with the recent high-demand peaks. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the P25 regime remains high, with a significant surge in P39-P40 (avg 170) causing stockouts, despite a lower mid-regime average (~90).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-demand regime starting around Period 25. Recent demand in Periods 39-41 (184, 156, 186) significantly exceeds previous levels, leading to stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 553 units are in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observation (P37 order arrived in P41). To address the recent spike and minimize stockout risk, I am using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current high-demand, high-variance environment while still incorporating enough history to stabilize the forecast. This will likely result in a higher base stock to buffer against the recent volatility (avg ~122, std ~57 in last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average demand for P39-P41 reached 175.3 units, significantly higher than the P25-P38 average of ~102, causing consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and recurring surges. While Period 42 saw a dip to 90 units, the preceding surge (P39-P41 average of ~175) led to significant stockouts in P40 and P41. We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around P25, but with increased intensity starting P39. The average demand across this entire 'high' regime (P25-P42) is approximately 117 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P39-P42) average 154 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (Std Dev ~48 over the regime), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5 covers the recent surge and the latest observation) to capture the elevated mean of ~140. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=18 (the length of the P25 regime) to capture the characteristic high volatility of this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 continues with high volatility; however, a specific demand surge starting P39 (avg ~154 units over P39-P42) has significantly increased the risk of stockouts compared to the P25-P38 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a high-demand regime that started around Period 39 (average ~148 units/period over P39-P43), which has led to multiple stockouts (P40, P41, P43). In Period 43, demand was 124 units, and on-hand inventory is now 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), a high service level is required to avoid lost sales during this volatile period. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P39-P43) to capture the current elevated demand level (average ~148), which scales to a base stock for 5 periods (L+1). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the high volatility observed in this specific peak (ranging from 90 to 186 units). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for the recent increase in standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed starting P39: Average demand for P39-P43 is ~148 units (+45% over the P25-P38 average of ~102), characterized by extreme volatility and frequent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-demand regime starting around Period 39. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P39-P44) is approximately 140 units, with peaks reaching 186. This is significantly higher than earlier baselines. Since P39, we have experienced stockouts in three out of six periods (P40, P41, P43) because the on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover these surges. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this latest surge. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to better reflect the current high variance, which ensures a higher safety stock level. The pipeline (632 units) is substantial relative to the current on-hand (85), but given the 4-period lead time and demand levels, maintaining a robust base stock is necessary to bridge the gap until future arrivals.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 39 continues to be characterized by high volume and extreme volatility, with a recent average (P39-P45) of 142.4 units and individual peaks reaching 186. This is significantly higher than the earlier P25 baseline. Currently, we have 105 units on-hand and 518 units in-transit. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (Lead Time + 1) to avoid the stockouts seen between Periods 40-43. I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this high-demand, high-volatility phase (starting P39). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extremely high volatility, moving from a period of high demand (P39-P45 avg ~134) to a sharp drop in Period 46 (demand=24). This drop follows several periods of stockouts and high-demand stress. Given the high volatility and recent trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8, covering the high-demand regime P39-P46) to balance the recent surge against the most recent low point. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (70) to account for the high standard deviation observed in the P25-P46 regime (range 24-188). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand plus in-transit (220+541=761) is currently high, so these parameters will likely result in a smaller or zero order to prevent overstocking as we approach the game end (P50).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in P46 with a sharp drop to 24 units following a sustained high-demand regime (P39-P45 avg ~134).

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown extreme volatility in the most recent regime (starting Period 39). While the average demand from P39-P47 is approximately 126 units, individual periods have spiked as high as 186 units and dropped as low as 24 units. The 'Period 47 conclude' shows a healthy ending inventory of 274 units with 374 units in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed in Period 48 will arrive in Period 52 (after the game ends). Therefore, the objective is to manage the existing 648 total units (on-hand + in-transit) to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Current inventory levels are more than sufficient to cover even a high-demand scenario (e.g., 3 periods * 186 units = 558 units). I will set the parameters to reflect the recent mean (~126) and high volatility observed since Period 39 to ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order in the final stages, while maintaining enough stock to maximize revenue without incurring excessive holding costs on excess units that won't sell before Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of intense volatility and high demand (P39-P45). The average demand over the last three periods (P46-P48) is approximately 78.7 units, which is significantly lower than the P39-P45 average (~134 units) and consistent with previous stable regimes. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 325 units, and in-transit inventory is 304 units (from P45, P46, and P48). Given the game is ending at Period 50, the order arriving in Period 49 (from P45) and the order arriving in Period 50 (from P46) will be the last ones to contribute to sales. I will set the demand parameters based on a recent window (N=10) to capture the blend of the high-demand surge and the recent cooling, ensuring a safe buffer without over-ordering as we approach the final period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 46: Mean demand for P46-P48 is ~79, reflecting a cool-down from the P39-P45 high-demand surge (avg ~134).

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 46 is now well-established over the last four periods (P46-P49), with an average demand of approximately 89 units (24, 113, 99, 120). This significantly differs from the high-demand surge seen in P39-P45 (average ~134). Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 267 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45 exactly 4 periods after they were placed. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use historical lead time performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 (covering the shift starting at P46 plus one prior period) to reflect the recent lower mean and volatility, balancing the stock level for the current 5-period window (L+1).
