Historical data (Periods 1-5 provided as historical context) show demand ranging from 74 to 135 units, with an average of approximately 106 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 5. This creates a pipeline requirement for Period 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 demand (L+1 periods). Total expected demand for 5 periods based on the historical mean (106 * 5) is 530 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts during the lead time while balancing holding costs ($1/unit), I will place an initial order to establish the pipeline.

Order placed in P1 (530 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (Resolution Phase) and be visible in P6. P2 order (100 units) is expected in P6. Currently, no orders have arrived, which is expected under a 4-period lead time. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: On-hand is 0.

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a high-demand, high-volatility regime. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged 140.2 units, but with significant spikes as high as 186. The promised (and confirmed) lead time is 4 periods. My objective is to cover demand for the lead time plus the current decision period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 850 units, consisting of orders from P41 (120), P42 (150), P43 (280), and P44 (300). These are expected to arrive in P45, P46, P47, and P48 respectively. Total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 850. Expected demand over the next 5 periods (P45-P49), using a conservative buffer for volatility (base 145 units/period), is approximately 725 units. Since the game ends at P50, I need to ensure arrivals for P49 cover the final stretch without over-ordering and incurring high holding costs. The 850 units already in the pipeline cover the remaining periods at an average of 141 units/period. However, given the recent stockouts (P41-P44) and the need to rebuild a small safety buffer for the final periods, I will place a moderate order. An order of 100 units ensures that the arrival in P49 (L=4) provides enough stock for the final two periods (P49 and P50) even if demand spikes again, while minimizing end-of-game excess.",

The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by the arrival of the P41 order in P45. Currently, the SKU is in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The total pipeline (in-transit) is 830 units, consisting of orders from P42 (150), P43 (280), P44 (300), and P45 (100). The P42 order (150 units) is expected to arrive in Period 46. With the game ending at Period 50, we only need to cover the remaining 5 periods of demand (P46-P50). Total expected demand for the remainder is ~720 units (144 * 5). Since the current pipeline of 830 units covers this total requirement and we are nearing the end of the simulation, the focus shifts to minimizing ending inventory to avoid terminal holding costs. No new order is placed to allow the existing in-transit volume to satisfy remaining demand while bleeding off excess stock.",

  "rationale": "We are in the final stages of the simulation (Period 47 of 50). The primary goal shifts from long-term pipeline management to minimizing ending inventory while avoiding stockouts in the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is after the game ends. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs without generating revenue. The current pipeline (In-transit: 680 units) is composed of: P43 (280), P44 (300), and P45 (100). These are scheduled to arrive in P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Specifically, 280 units arrive during P47 (visible in P48 start), 300 in P48, and 100 in P49. Total available units for the remaining 4 periods = 126 (On-hand) + 280 (arrive P47) + 300 (arrive P48) + 100 (arrive P49) = 806 units. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with an average of roughly 130-150 in the last 10 periods, though P46 was an outlier low at 24. Even at a high average of 150 units/period, total demand for 4 periods would be ~600 units. Since 806 units are already guaranteed to arrive, we have a surplus relative to expected demand. Placing further orders would only increase holding costs and ending inventory penalties.",

Total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) at a conservative average of 140/period is 420 units.
