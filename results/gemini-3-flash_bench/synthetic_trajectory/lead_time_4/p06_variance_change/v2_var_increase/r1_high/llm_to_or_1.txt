Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) are 132, 74, 101, 90, 135, resulting in a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.8. Since total lead-time-plus-review-period protection is (1+L) = 5 periods, the required mu_hat is approximately 532. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (N=5). As we progress and observe actual lead times and potentially shifts in demand, I will adjust the N or methods accordingly. The OR backend will use the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to determine the optimal service level (q = 0.95).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. Since the actual lead time is at least 1, the order has not yet arrived (as confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message showing arrived=0 and sold=0 due to zero on-hand). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and 151 units are in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 99. Historical samples for the first 5 periods (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) give a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.1. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the provided pre-game distribution. The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order expected in P5 arrival resolution, visible P6). Current on-hand is 0, so we have lost sales for Period 1 and 2. Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided in the context (though the game history only shows P1 and P2) shows Period 1: 132, 2: 74, 3: 101, 4: 90, 5: 135. However, the game history for Period 1 and 2 shows 99 and 63 respectively. I will use the actual game history demand (99, 63) to inform my forecast. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock target needs to cover demand over L+1 = 5 periods. I'll use the 'default' method for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 4 is incorrect. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the most recent actual observations (99 and 63) since they differ from the pre-game samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 106 units (132, 74, 101, 90, 135 from user context, though the history block shows 99, 63, 66 for the first 3 periods). I will align with the provided samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) which average 106.4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units), Period 2 (137 units), and Period 3 (123 units) are currently in-transit and haven't arrived yet, which is consistent with L=4 (expected arrival in Period 5, 6, and 7 respectively). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales. I will set mu_hat based on the average demand of 106.4 and L=4, which equals 106.4 * 5 = 532. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(samples) \u2248 2.23 * 25.8 \u2248 57.6. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend covers the full (L+1) period demand cycles while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (151 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which we will observe at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 560 units (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand over the first 4 periods (99, 63, 66, 83) shows a mean of 77.75 and a standard deviation of 16.4. Since we have not yet observed a full lead-time cycle to confirm actual lead time or potential losses, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand signal while accounting for the high service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1149.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and Period 5 confirmed that the first order (placed in Period 1) arrived exactly on time (L=4). Orders from Period 2, 3, and 4 are still in transit (309 units) and are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 132 (pre-game), 74 (pre-game), 101 (pre-game), 90 (pre-game), 135 (pre-game). In-game demand (observed via 'conclude' messages) has been: 99, 63, 66, 83, and 65. The in-game demand (mean ~75) is significantly lower than the pre-game samples (mean ~106). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 in-game demand samples to capture this lower trend. sigma_hat will also be adjusted using the last 5 samples to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' will remain at the default (4) as confirmed by the Period 5 arrival.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). There are currently 272 units in-transit (orders from Period 3 and 4), which matches our expectation for L=4. Demand across the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, and 99. The mean demand is approximately 79. Since there is no clear seasonal or structural shift yet, I will use all 6 available data points to estimate current demand. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using all historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable base stock calculation to cover the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 and 2 orders arrived exactly at L=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1873.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods based on deliveries from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving exactly at L=4. There are currently 212 units in transit (ordered in Periods 4 and 7). Demand has been relatively stable but shows a slight upward trend in the last three periods (65, 99, 106) compared to the initial periods. To account for this recent increase while maintaining the confirmed lead time, I will set L to 'default' (4), use 'recent_5' for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (average of P3-P7: ~84 per period), and 'recent_5' for sigma_hat given the observation of moderate volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) based on the most relevant recent data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3010.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promise. Inventories are now beginning to cycle properly after the initial lead time delay. Order arrivals from Period 1-4 have concluded. Currently, we have 125 units on-hand and 178 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 7 and 8). The demand history shows a recent spike in Period 8 (165 units) compared to the earlier average of around 90. To account for this potential upward shift in demand while maintaining responsiveness, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 4-8), as Period 8's high demand significantly impacts the mean. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) using the most relevant recent volatility and volume trends.

Carry-over insight: Demand saw a significant spike in Period 8 (165 units, +80% vs previous 7-period average); monitor for sustained upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-8) confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. However, Period 9 saw zero arrivals because no order was placed in Period 5, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0, lost sales implied as demand 133 > sold 125). In-transit inventory is 344 units (ordered in Periods 7, 8, and 9). Demand analysis shows a significant shift: Periods 1-7 averaged ~83 units/period, while Periods 8-9 averaged 149 units (+80%). This suggests a new demand regime or a significant upward trend. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this higher demand level (approx 140 units/period) across the review+lead time (1+4=5 periods), totaling 700. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. Lead time remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8: average increased from ~83 to ~149 (+80%).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analyzing the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 8. The average demand for Periods 1-7 was approximately 83 units, whereas the average demand for Periods 8-10 is roughly 137 units (165, 133, 114), representng a ~65% increase. We are currently experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0) because orders from Periods 5 and 6 (which were size 0) resulted in no arrivals during Periods 9 and 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed for orders 1-4. To address the new demand level and recover from the stockout, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (the new regime) and increasing sigma_hat to account for higher volatility. The backend will calculate base stock using L=4 and our parameters, ordering enough to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 7 order in Period 11. However, the orders from Period 8 (115 units) and Period 9 (166 units) are missing, as they should have arrived in Periods 12 and 13 respectively if L=4 was stable. Looking at Period 11's conclusion, only the Period 7 order arrived. This suggests a potential delay or loss of shipments from Period 8 and 9. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Mean demand for Periods 1-7 was ~83, while Periods 8-11 averaged ~126 (though Period 8 was a peak at 165). Given the current stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~126). Since we have missed expected arrivals from Period 8, I will set L to 'explicit' value 5 to account for the observed delay and increase the base stock calculation window to cover the gap.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 8 (115 units) and Period 9 (166 units) are delayed; expected arrivals in P12 and P13 did not occur as per L=4. Adjusting lead time estimate to 5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the order from Period 8 arrived (115 units), but after a lead time of 4 periods, not 5 as previously speculated. This confirms the lead time L remains 4. However, we have experienced stockouts from Period 9 through 12 due to a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to 12 is approximately 127.8 units, compared to the pre-shift average of ~83 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 712 units in transit (orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). The order from Period 9 (166 units) is expected to arrive during this Period 13 (L=4). To stabilize, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the higher demand regime (approx 128 units/period) and L=4. The OR engine will then calculate the base stock for a 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time L=4 confirmed (Period 8 arrived P12). Stockout sequence (P9-P12) due to demand regime shift (~128 units/period since P8).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the order from Period 9 arrived with a lead time of 4 periods, confirming that the lead time remains stable at L=4 despite previous fears of delays. The demand regime from Period 8 onward (Period 8 to 13) has established a new mean of approximately 129.7 units per period, compared to the pre-regime shift average of ~81 units. The stockout sequence (Periods 9-12) has ended, and we currently have 47 units on hand with significant pipeline inventory (572 units) due to aggressive ordering during the shortage. Given the consistent higher demand over the last 6 periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture this regime shift accurately while using the default lead time (L=4).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 8. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P8-P14) is approximately 124 units, which is significantly higher (+50%) than the first 7 periods (approx 83 units). Lead time (L) has consistently returned to the promised 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, P13, and P14). I am setting L to the promised value of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using N=7 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. This will ensure the base stock levels are calculated based on the current run rate of ~124 units per period, preventing the stockouts observed between P9 and P12.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state shows Period 15 ending with 239 units on-hand and 400 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P13, P14, and P15). Demand analysis shows two regimes: P1-P7 averaged 83 units/period, while P8-P15 averaged 116 units/period. The spike in P8 (165) was followed by a sustained higher level, though P15 shows a local dip (66). Period 15 demand of 66 is significantly lower than the P8-P14 average, but I will maintain the higher forecast to avoid stockouts given the previous stockout sequence (P9-P12). I will set L=4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime starting at P8) to capture the higher mean and volatility observed since the regime shift.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 8) averages 116.7 units per period, a significant increase from the initial periods. Although Period 15 showed a temporary dip (66 units), Period 16 rebounded to 115 units, confirming the higher demand level persists. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5-8 and 11-16). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy (301 units) and there is a steady pipeline (277 units). Setting N=9 for demand parameters captures the entirety of the high-demand regime since Period 8. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent volatility and mean, helping the OR engine maintain a high service level while managing the current healthy stock position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 8 has stabilized. Excluding the high spike in P8 and the lower volatility in recent periods (P15-P17), the average demand from P9 to P17 is approximately 111.5 units. Lead time is consistently observed at L=4 periods (P13 order arrived P17). Current on-hand inventory is 209 units with 358 in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the higher demand regime while smoothing out the outlier spike from Period 8. The backend will calculate base stock using L=4 and these recent history statistics to maintain a high service level (~95% given profit/holding ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average demand from P9 to P17 is ~112 units, confirming a level higher than P1-P7 (~80) but lower than the initial P8 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $529.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 8 remains stable, with current on-hand inventory at 269 units and 369 units in-transit. The recent 10-period average demand (P9-P18) is approximately 104.7 units, and the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Although Period 18 saw a dip to 42 units, this follows a period of stable demand around 110-120 units; thus, I will use a recent_N window (N=11, covering the regime since P8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the higher demand levels compared to the start of the game while moderating for the recent outlier. The lead time (L) remains 4, as confirmed by the arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1156.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that the lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods (P14 and P15 arrivals confirmed this). Demand has entered a more moderate regime after the spike in P8 and the subsequent stockout period. Over the last 11 periods (P9-P19), the average demand is approximately 102 units, though recent periods (P18-P19) have shown lower values (42 and 76). However, to avoid under-stocking while balancing the current high on-hand inventory (288 units) and pipeline (309 units), I will use a recent window of 11 periods to capture the post-spike demand level. The on-hand inventory is currently high due to the arrival of large orders placed during the stockout recovery phase. Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=11 (covering the current regime), and sigma_hat with recent_N=11 will allow the OR backend to stabilize the order flow as the system works through the existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime (P9-P19) stabilized at an average of ~102 units, significantly lower than the P8 peak but higher than the initial P1-P7 baseline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. From Period 9 to Period 20, demand has stabilized into a post-spike regime following the Period 8 outlier. Analyzing demand from Period 9 to Period 20 gives a mean of approximately 104.3 units per period (sum: 1252, N=12). This is higher than the initial baseline (Period 1-7 avg ~83) but lower than the spike seen in Period 8. The lead time has consistently returned to 4 periods as observed in the most recent arrival conclusions (P14-P16 orders all arrived at L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 192, and in-transit is 276, totaling 468. With L=4, the coverage requirement is for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 104.3 = 521.5 units. The system is slightly under-buffered for the upcoming weeks given the high variance (Period 20 demand was 150). I will use N=12 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime and N=12 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 has stabilized at a lower level than the initial spike in Period 8, but remains higher than the early baseline. From Period 9 to Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 104 units. The lead time has consistently returned to the promised 4 periods since the resolution of the delay in Period 12. Currently, there is a relatively high on-hand inventory (185 units) and a healthy pipeline (327 units). To optimize for the observed stabilized demand while maintaining the target service level, I am using a recent window (N=13, from Period 9 to Period 21) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the post-spike stability while excluding the outlier demand of Period 8 and the initial lower-demand regime. The lead time parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high reliability of the 4-period delivery observed in the Conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P8 spike (P9-P21) is stable with an average of ~104 units. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $522.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 9 to Period 22 shows a stabilized average demand of approximately 104 units per period, following a significant spike in Period 8. The most recent demand in Period 22 was quite low (41 units), consistent with occasional volatility observed in this regime (e.g., Period 18 was 42 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 14 through 18. Current inventory position is healthy with 257 units on-hand and 345 units in-transit. To maintain optimal service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the stable regime from P9 to P22). This captures the current mean of ~104 and the associated variance better than the full history, which includes the distinct early low-demand phase and the P8 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $828.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 has stabilized but shows significant volatility. The mean demand from Period 9 to Period 23 is approximately 101.4 units. Looking at the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the mean is approximately 92.3 units with a standard deviation of about 37. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory (236) and in-transit units (342) are relatively high compared to the recent average demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the post-spike stability (covering P9-P23) while providing a robust buffer for the volatility seen in periods like P20 (150 units). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using recent_N=15 to reflect this recent variance. This approach ensures the backend maintains a base stock that accounts for the current 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering during periods of briefly lower demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9-P24) shows stabilization following the P8 spike, with demand averaging approximately 101 units per period. The last few periods have shown higher volatility (P24 demand was 150), but the overall trend remains steady. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 107 units on-hand and 365 units in-transit (covering orders from P21, P22, P23, and P24), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 16-period stable regime (P9-P24) and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current volatility while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a post-spike regime starting from Period 9. Analyzing demand from Period 9 to Period 25, the average demand is approximately 103 units per period (sum: 1751 / 17 periods). This is significantly higher than the initial Period 1-7 average (~83), but lower than the Period 8 spike (165). Recent volatility remains moderate, with demand swinging between 41 and 150. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (Orders from P17-P21 all arrived at L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 182 and in-transit is 368, totaling 550 units. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) using the established demand regime (N=17). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 will capture this stable post-spike average while acknowledging the variance. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as it remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P26) shows high volatility with values of 150, 83, and 167. The post-spike demand regime (from P8 onwards) is the most relevant for forecasting. Since P8, the average demand is approximately 107.5 units per period. However, the last few periods show a slight upward trend in mean and variance (avg of P24-P26 is 133). To ensure responsiveness to these higher demand signals while acknowledging historical stability, I will use a N=19 period lookback (dating back to P8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher post-spike average with recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but remains within the post-spike stabilized regime identified around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 27 is approximately 107 units per period. Evaluating the most recent 10 periods (P18-P27), the average is 108.9 units, and the standard deviation is significant due to the recent fluctuation between 41 and 167 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 23 order arriving exactly in Period 27 as expected. On-hand inventory is currently 126, which combined with 460 in-transit units, provides sufficient coverage for the (L+1) period window, especially given the backend's base-stock logic. Using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current level and volatility while filtering out the initial low-demand regime from P1-P7 and the extreme P8 outlier.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the demand environment remains in the post-P8 regime. Looking at demand from P9 to P28, the average is approximately 104.5 units per period. Recently (P24-P28), demand has shown high volatility (150, 83, 167, 52, 113) with no clear upward or downward drift, necessitating a recent demand window to capture current variability. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals from P20 through P24. The pipeline inventory is high (474 units) relative to the on-hand stock (57 units), but given the lead time of 4 periods and the current demand mean, the system needs to maintain coverage. I will use a 20-period window (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the stable regime post-P8 and mitigate the noise of the high-volatility spikes seen in the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3542.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently (P26: 167, P28: 113, P29: 188). Since the regime shift in Period 8, demand has settled into a higher average compared to the initial periods. Over the last 15 periods (P15 to P29), the average demand is 108.5 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 30 units on hand and 431 units in-transit, we need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods). An N=15 for mu_hat captures the post-fluctuation average well, while N=15 for sigma_hat accounts for the recent increase in variance observed in the late 20s. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in the late 20s (P26-P29), with an average of 130 units over those 4 periods, compared to the P9-P21 average of ~104.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P30) has shown increased volatility and a higher volume, averaging approximately 117 units per period compared to the previous stable average of ~104. Period 29 specifically saw a peak of 188 units. To account for this increased volatility and the recent upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current state. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple delivery cycles (P26-P30 arrivals), so I will use the default promised lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the higher standard deviation observed in the latest demand samples, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover these wider fluctuations while balancing the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift confirmed: P26-P30 average is 117.2 units (+12.7% vs P9-P25 average of 104) with significant spikes (P29: 188).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a more volatile regime starting around Period 26. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 113 units, which is a step up from the previous stable range of ~104 units. Specifically, we've seen significant spikes (as high as 188). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the Period 27 order arriving exactly on schedule in Period 31. To account for this increased mean and heightened volatility while minimizing stockout risk, I am selecting recent_N = 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-variance regime. L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the stable historical lead time data.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: P26-P31 average is 113.0 units with high variance (min 52, max 188), requiring responsive parameter settings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2515.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are evaluating the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Since Period 26, demand has entered a more volatile regime. The average demand from P26 to P32 is approximately 113.3 units, compared to the previous stable average of ~104. More importantly, the variance has increased significantly (P29 saw 188 units while P27 saw 52). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. To account for this increased volatility and provide a responsive forecast, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the start of this volatile period at P26). This calculates demand parameters based on the most recent regime shift. The OR backend will use these to adjust the base stock to maintain a high service level despite the higher variance while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift sustained: P26-P32 average is 113.3 units (+9% vs P9-P25) with high variance (Std Dev increased to ~48 from ~35), requiring N=7 for recent parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2132.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 115 units, following a sequence of high-volatility demand since P26. The average demand for the last seven periods (P27-P33) is approximately 108.9 units, while the volatility (standard deviation) remains elevated compared to the mid-game stability. On-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit inventory is high (599 units) due to large orders placed recently (P30: 180, P31: 216). Promised lead time remains reliable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P29 order in P33. To balance the risk of stockouts during this high-variance phase while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory, I will continue using recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand level and heightened volatility without overreacting to individual spikes like P29 (188).

Daily Reward (R_t): $807.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a more volatile regime starting around Period 26. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 109 units, but with a significant standard deviation caused by periodic spikes (e.g., P26, P29, P32). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Currently, there is a healthy on-hand inventory of 181 units, with substantial in-transit orders (478 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. To capture the recent increase in both the mean and volatility without over-reacting to single-period outliers, I am using recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire duration of the current volatile regime. For lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method as historical performance has been consistently aligned with the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to display significant volatility. Following a high-demand phase (P26-P33), the last two periods (P34-P35) have seen a notable drop to 52 and 55 units respectively. However, given the carry-over insights detailing increased volatility since P26, using a window of N=10 for mu_hat (covering P26-P35) provides a balanced average of 102.2 units per period, which aligns with recent historical shifts while accounting for the latest low-demand data points. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (342 units) due to recent large arrivals (216 units in P35) coinciding with low demand. Using N=10 for sigma_hat captures the increased standard deviation observed in the recent volatile regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer despite the current inventory surplus.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and a higher mean since Period 26. The average demand from P26 to P36 is approximately 106.3 units, with a standard deviation significantly higher than the initial periods. Recent demand in P34-P36 has been slightly lower (52, 55, 113), but given the high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs to maintain a target inventory that protects against the frequent spikes observed earlier (e.g., P26, P29, P32). I will use N=11 (P26-P36) to capture this higher volatility regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent history (P30-P32 orders arrived exactly at L=4 in P34-P36). On-hand inventory is healthy (296) with significant in-transit (289), so the parameters will ensure the pipeline remains balanced without excessive over-ordering.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P37) has shown increased volatility and a slightly higher mean (average ~104) compared to the mid-game stability. In the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the average demand is 94.4, but the overall context since P26 suggests a regime where demand frequently spikes above 130. The system currently carries a high on-hand inventory (295) and healthy in-transit stock (262), totaling 557 units of pipeline inventory. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the observed volatility, I am using a recent window (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics (starting Period 26). This balances the high inventory levels with the need to maintain a buffer for the intermittent demand spikes observed in the last 12 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $886.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P38) continues to exhibit higher volatility and a slightly higher mean compared to the P9-P25 period. Specifically, the average demand over the last 13 periods (P26-P38) is approximately 105.3, which is close to the long-term average but contains significant spikes (e.g., 188, 167, 137). Period 38 demand was 62. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 292, with 349 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained increase in demand variance since Period 26, I am using recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility regime while maintaining enough history to smooth out the noise from recent lower demand days (P34-P38). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against spikes while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (starting P26) persists: P26-P38 average is ~105 with a significant increase in standard deviation compared to P9-P25, necessitating a larger window (N=13) for stable parameter estimation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and occasional spikes, as seen in Period 39 (184 units). Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized around 105-110 units but with a significantly higher standard deviation compared to earlier periods. To capture this 'high-volatility' regime accurately while providing enough safety stock to handle spikes like P39, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the period from P26 to P39). This window size is large enough to stabilize the mean estimate while adequately reflecting the current variance levels. The lead time L=4 remains consistent, with the Period 35 order arriving exactly on schedule in Period 39. The current on-hand inventory (173) and in-transit units (328) are being monitored to ensure we do not over-order given the backend's base-stock logic, but the high mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 14 periods will help maintain service levels against potential demand surges.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context continues to show high volatility, a pattern that emerged around Period 26. Since the shift, demand has averaged approximately 106 units with a significantly higher standard deviation. Reviewing the most recent results: Period 39 demand was 184 and Period 40 was 156. These are substantially higher than the long-term average, suggesting the current volatility regime remains active. On-hand inventory is low (46 units) following these high-demand periods, but the pipeline is substantial (489 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P36 order arrived in P40). To handle the current volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs, I will use a window of N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period from P26 to P40, effectively capturing the higher-variance regime while providing enough samples to stabilize the mean forecast against individual spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2945.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system experienced a stockout (demand 186, sold 155), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. This confirms the high-demand volatility regime identified in Period 39 continues. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 41 is approximately 113.8 units, but more importantly, the last 3 periods (P39-P41) have averaged 175.3 units, indicating a sharp peak or sustained upward shift. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the leading time of 4 periods, I will use a recent window (N=16) to capture the current volatile regime for mu_hat. This balances the overall regime average with the very recent spikes. I will also use N=16 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine provides a sufficiently high safety stock (z-score calculation) to handle the observed variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P37 order arrived in P41).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand volatility regime (P26-P41): Average demand ~114, with recent 3-period peak (P39-P41) averaging 175. stockout occurred in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P39-P41) showed a significant spike (avg ~175), leading to a stockout in P41. Although P42 demand returned to a lower level (90), the volatility remains very high, as noted in the Carry-over Insight from P42. The system currently has 624 units in transit and 56 on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by P38 order arriving in P42). Given the high variance and recent stockout, I am using a window of N=17 (covering P26 to P42) to capture the increased demand volatility and mean while ensuring current high-demand peaks are sufficiently weighted for future-proofing inventory. This aligns L=4 with high-demand trends and volatility (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (P26-P42) continues to show high variance and occasional extreme peaks (P41: 186); current average for this regime is ~113. Expected arrival for P43 is the P39 order (44 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face another stockout (ending on-hand: 0) following a demand of 124 units. The arrival from Period 39 (44 units) was fully consumed. Historically, we are in a high-demand volatility regime that began around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 18 periods (P26-P43) is approximately 111.9 units, but volatility is significant, with recent peaks hitting 186. To stabilize our base stock calculation and avoid excessive stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a regime-specific window of N=18 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P39 order arriving in P43). Given the high pipeline inventory (658 units) relative to recent demand averages, the capped order policy will likely restrict orders this period, but maintaining a robust base stock parameter is essential for future resilience.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (P26-P43) confirmed: mean demand ~112 units/period with significantly higher variance compared to early history (P1-P25). Stockouts in P41 and P43 highlight the need for N=18 to capture this sustained instability.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we observed an arrival of 190 units (ordered in Period 40), confirming the stable lead time of 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is now 89 units. The demand for Period 44 was 101 units. I am tracking a sustained demand volatility regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted to approximately 112 units per period with a significantly higher standard deviation (roughly 46-48) compared to the early stages of the game. Recent demand has been quite erratic, including peaks near 190 units and stockouts in Periods 41 and 43. Using a window of N=19 (covering the regime from P26 to P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend capture the average demand level and the increased variance required to protect against stockouts during this volatile phase. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level, and my parameters provide it with the necessary statistical basis to do so.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (P26-P44) continues: mean demand is ~112 units/period with persistent high variance (Std Dev ~47), requiring a window of N=19 for stable but responsive parameter estimation.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 continues to demonstrate high volatility and an elevated mean compared to earlier history. Period 45 demand was 156 units, which is significantly above the historical average but consistent with recent spikes (P41: 186, P39: 184). For Period 46, I am observing an on-hand inventory of 125 units with 466 units in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained instability and higher variance observed since P26 (20 periods ago), I will use N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable estimate of the 'new normal' while smoothing out the extreme period-to-period noise that has characterized the recent regime, helping the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to prevent stockouts like those seen in P41 and P43 without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (P26-P45) confirmed: 20-period average is ~114 units/period with frequent spikes >150 units. Statistical properties have remained consistent for 20 periods.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 continues to exhibit high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 47) and a mean demand of approximately 114 units. Period 46 saw a significant drop (demand=24), but following the recent pattern, this is likely transient and could be followed by a rebound. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), orders placed now will arrive exactly in the final period (47+4=51, resolution happens after decisions), meaning this is the last or second-to-last order that can actually be fulfilled. Given the current on-hand inventory of 299 units and 433 units in transit, we are well-covered for the remaining periods. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this volatile but established regime (P26-P46) and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1883.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand volatility regime starting at Period 26 is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 114 units and high variance. Period 47 conclude shows an arrival of 78 units from the P43 order, confirming lead time remains 4 periods. Since the game is ending at Period 50, orders placed now (P48) with L=4 will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage current pipeline and safety stock. I will use N=22 (covering the regime from P26 to P47) to capture the stable but high-variance properties of the current demand environment. Maintaining the promised lead time of 4 is appropriate given recent arrival consistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1619.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 (23 periods) remains high and volatile, with a mean of approximately 114 units/period and high variance. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has slightly softened (113, 99, 24) but historical spikes >180 units are common. Stockouts in Period 41 and 43 emphasize the need for robust inventory coverage despite high current on-hand stock (262 units). The pipeline is significant (380 units), with an expected arrival of 93 units (from P45) in the upcoming period resolution. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use N=23 (the length of the current volatility regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable but representative average of this shift, ensuring the base-stock levels account for the regime's inherent variance while managing the risk of over-ordering given the approaching end of the game (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2045.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 continues to exhibit high volatility and a higher mean compared to the early game, with the most recent 24 periods (P26-P49) averaging 111.4 units. Period 49 demand was 120 units, consistent with this volatile regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P45 order arrived P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is 235 units, and in-transit inventory is 379 units. To maintain responsiveness to the frequent demand spikes (like Period 41's 186 or Period 45's 156) while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am using a window of N=24 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased average demand and the significant variance observed since Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime (P26-P49) remains the primary driver: 24-period mean is ~111 units with high standard deviation (~45), necessitating N=24 for stable parameter estimation. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.
