The historical demand data shows an average of 106.4 units per period (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) with moderate variability. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for at least 5 periods (L+1). Calculation: Expected demand for 5 periods \u2248 532 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show an average demand of approximately 106 units/period. Demand in the 'conclude' messages (99, 63, 66, 83) shows a slightly lower average of ~78 units/period.

Strategy: The pipeline (577) already covers approximately 5.4 periods of demand (at 106/period) or 7.4 periods (at 78/period). According to the 'Review + Lead' logic (L+1 = 5 periods), we should have enough in the pipeline to cover the lead time gap.

The OR recommendation of 70 units is based on a longer historical average including the low-demand early periods (P1-P5).\n4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 70 is conservative.

Current on-hand inventory is 43 units. The pipeline (In-transit) is 525 units, which consists of orders from P42 (166), P43 (150), P44 (134), and P45 (75). Given the game ends at Period 50, the order placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50 (after the Period 50 decision but before demand resolution) and will be the final arrival of the game. Total inventory available to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is Current On-Hand (43) + Total Pipeline (525) = 568 units. Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~135 units. Projecting this forward, we need approximately 135 * 5 = 675 units to satisfy all remaining demand. Currently, we have 568, leaving a gap of 107 units. The OR recommendation is 110 units. Ordering 110 units will bring our total coverage to 678 units, aligning perfectly with the forecasted demand of 675.
