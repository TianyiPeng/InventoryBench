Since demand resolution (Step 3) happens after my decision (Step 1) and arrival (Step 2), and on-hand inventory is currently 0, the demand for Period 1 through Period 4 (while the first order is in transit) will likely be lost. To maximize long-term reward, I must cover demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (the period during which the order is placed), totaling 5 periods of demand (L+1). Historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show values of 132, 74, 101, 90, and 135, resulting in an average of approximately 106 units per period.

Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 530-650 units (based on a mean of 106-130). Since I already have 530 units in transit arriving by P6, I should place an additional order to ensure I don't run out immediately after the first shipment arrives and to build a small buffer.

The recent actuals are slightly higher than the initial samples, suggesting a mean demand around 120-125 units. (c) Lead Time Analysis: The Period 1 order (530 units) arrived in Period 5. This confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (5-1=4), matching the promised lead time. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 407. In-transit pipeline includes orders from Period 2 (130), Period 3 (100), Period 4 (100), and Period 5 (100), totaling 430 units. Total Inventory Position (IP) = 407 + 430 = 837.

Since my current IP (837) is significantly higher than the 625 needed to cover the lead time (likely due to the high initial order of 530), and holding cost is $1/unit, I should not place a large order.

Current inventory state is 484 units on-hand with 100 units in-transit (ordered P40, expected arrival P44). Total inventory available to cover the rest of the game is 584 units. Historical demand analysis shows a recent 'low-demand, high-volatility' regime since P38. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 63 units/period (6, 81, 58, 83, 13, 137). Total expected demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50), using this average, is approximately 441 units. Even if demand reverts to the long-term mean of ~112, the total requirement for 7 periods would be ~784 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the remaining time and the current excess inventory (484 on-hand + 100 arriving today), placing an order now is not justified. Inventory on hand plus the upcoming arrival is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remainder of the game while minimizing holding costs.",

Ordering more would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) which are significantly eroding the profit.

Recent demand has been highly volatile: 137 (P43), 0 (P44), and 163 (P45), averaging approximately 100 units over the last three periods. There are 5 periods of demand remaining (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). Total expected demand for these 5 periods is approximately 500 units (5 * 100). Our current on-hand inventory of 421 units is slightly below this total requirement. However, we have 0 units in-transit. An order placed now would arrive just in time for the final period's demand. Given the high holding cost ($1) and the proximity to the end of the game, I will place a small order to buffer against stockouts in the final period while avoiding significant ending inventory. Ordering 100 units ensures we have roughly 521 units available to cover the remaining 5 periods, which aligns with the recent average demand of ~100/period.",

Total available inventory = 457 units. Recent demand (P38-P46) has been extremely volatile, averaging approximately 67 units per period. Projecting this average for the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50) suggests a total remaining demand of ~268 units. With 457 units already in the pipeline or on-hand, we have a significant surplus (approx. 189 units).

Given the 4-period lead time confirmed in the history, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in Period 52, which is after the game ends. Therefore, placing an order now is useless and would only potentially incur holding costs if the game logic allowed for late arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 232 units. Recent demand (P45-P47) has averaged approximately 117 units/period. Over the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50), even if demand spikes to 150/period, we would need 450 units. While we are slightly short of that if demand is high (232 on-hand + 100 in-transit arriving P50 = 332 total), any new order placed today is physically impossible to receive before the game ends.
