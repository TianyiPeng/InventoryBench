The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for demand in Period 6. Based on the 4-period lead time, I need to cover demand for Period 1 through Period 5 inclusive (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I am facing an immediate stockout situation for the first few periods which is unavoidable due to the lead time. Total expected demand for periods 1-5 is approximately 106.4 * 5 = 532 units. I will order 650 units to cover this initial demand window plus a buffer to build safety stock, considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors higher service levels.",

Average demand is approx 125 units/period. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (650 units) and P2 (130 units) are currently in-transit.

However, current on-hand inventory (572) already covers approximately 6 periods of average demand. To minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while nearing the end of the simulation, I will continue to draw down the existing surplus. No new order is needed this period as the inventory plus the incoming 150 units (arriving this period) will comfortably cover demand until the final periods.",

Any order placed after Period 45 will arrive too late to be sold or will arrive so late it barely contributes to the final score. Our current on-hand inventory is 722 units. Historical demand has a high-end mean of ~140 units/period (though recent periods show high variance and some very low demand). Even at a sustained high demand of 150 units/period, we would only consume 150 * 6 = 900 units through Period 50. Given we have 722 units on hand and 0 in transit, we have enough inventory to cover approximately 5 periods of high demand. Ordering more now would likely only increase holding costs, which are $1.0/unit, without significantly increasing sales, especially since the simulation ends at Period 50. The goal is to maximize total reward, which includes subtracting holding costs for ending inventory. Therefore, I will not place any further orders to allow the existing stock to deplete.",

Therefore, no orders placed from this period onward will benefit total profit; they will only incur procurement costs without the opportunity to satisfy demand. We currently have 559 units on-hand. Historical demand analysis shows a mean of ~114 units (last 10 periods) or ~107 units (life-to-date). Even at the highest observed demand (~192 units/period), the current on-hand inventory of 559 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods (46, 47, 48, 49) and likely the demand resolution of Period 50.

Our current on-hand inventory is 166 units. Looking at the demand history, the maximum demand recorded was 192 units, and the recent 10-period average is approximately 85 units (including a zero). 166 units is sufficient to cover most likely demand scenarios for the final period without risking excessive stock-outs, while minimizing the ending inventory that will be taxed by the holding cost.
