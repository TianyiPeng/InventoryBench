Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). Initial demand data for 5 periods shows values [132, 74, 101, 90, 135]. The mean demand is 106.4 and the standard deviation is 26.3. Since we have very limited data and no observed lead times yet, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. The OR backend will use the promised lead time (4) and the mean/std of the available 5 samples to set the initial base stock. The (1+L) factor in the backend's logic ensures coverage for the lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of demand).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, it has not arrived yet (arrived=0). Demand in Period 1 was 130, but because starting inventory was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost sales. Since we only have one demand observation (130) and the provided history shows significant variability (132, 74, 101, 90, 135), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most representative recent statistics. I will use 'default' for lead time as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Consequently, there is zero current on-hand inventory to satisfy demand for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales. A total of 300 units are currently in-transit (151 from P1 and 149 from P2). Because we have zero concluded lead-time observations, I will use the 'default' lead time setting. Demand for the first two periods was 130 and 144 (average 137). Since we have a very limited sample size (N=2 for observed demand, plus the provided historical samples), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to incorporate the historical data points (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) alongside the new observations to stabilize the forecast until a clear trend emerges. The parameters aim to build a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, which is expected as no orders could have arrived yet. Demand for the first three periods has been 130, 144, and 105 (average ~126). Since we have no completed lead-time observations, I will use the promised lead time 'default'. For demand and volatility, given the small sample size and no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels while waiting for the first arrival to confirm the lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (151 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1-4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 106.33 units over the first 5 samples provided (132, 74, 101, 90, 135), though the game history shows slightly different realized demand (130, 144, 105, 110). Aggregating these, the average demand is roughly 110-115 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Total in-transit is 618 units, which covers roughly 5.4 periods of demand at the current average. Since we are just reaching the first possible arrival, I will use 'default' (promised) lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the initial variance and mean without overreacting to the stockout-driven zero sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming a lead time of 4 periods. Since we have 5 historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) and recent periods 1-5 showed demand of (130, 144, 105, 110, 123), the demand is relatively stable around a mean of ~120. Currently, we have 28 units on hand and 505 in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). The pipeline inventory is high, suggesting the OR backend will moderate ordering if parameters are set correctly. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior since the game started. Lead time remains at the default (promised 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Confirming this, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively (confirmed by 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude' messages). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-6) are: 130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108. The mean demand is approximately 120 units/period with relatively low variance. Current on-hand is 69, and in-transit is 465 (which includes orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Since the pipeline is full and the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable recent demand pattern across the review + lead time window (1+4=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand over the last 7 periods has shown some variability (ranging from 73 to 144) but no clear trend or seasonal shift yet. The mean demand for the first 7 periods is approx 113.2. Current on-hand is 155, with 412 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Since lead time L=4, we must provide coverage for L+1=5 periods. My goal is to maintain the base stock level around (5 * 113) \u2248 565 units. In-transit + On-hand = 155 + 412 = 567 units, which roughly matches the pipeline requirement. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed values match the promise, and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the slight downward trend seen in the most recent periods (P6=108, P7=73).

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a steady state with the promised lead time of 4 periods being consistently met (orders from Periods 1-4 arrived in Periods 5-8). Current on-hand inventory is 183, and in-transit inventory is 295 (from orders in Periods 5-8). Historical demand shows relative stability with no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet. The average demand across all periods (including seed data and actuals) is approximately 110 units. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample size, as the demand pattern appears stationary. This approach balances the service level for high-profit items ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while maintaining the 4-period pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P5 arrived P9). On-hand inventory is 113, with 383 units in transit. The demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 114.67 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods) average is 104, while the last 5 periods average is 108.6. Given the stability and the lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=9 to capture the full historical demand since the game started, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (1+L) periods, which is 573 units (114.67 * 5). The 383 units in-transit plus 113 on-hand equals 496 units, which is slightly below the required base stock, triggering a small order to maintain the service level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 10, the lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised duration. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown stability since the initial historical data. The mean demand across all 15 observed samples (5 historical + 10 in-game) is approximately 112.5 units per period. The standard deviation is approximately 23 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, my base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Specifically, 5 * 112.5 = 562.5 units. Current on-hand (107) plus in-transit (390) equals 497 units, meaning the system will order roughly 65 units to reach the target service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to weight the in-game samples which show slightly higher variance than the initial 5 samples, ensuring the OR backend captures this volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 12. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 11, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by all arrivals up to Period 11). Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts; the average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 112.5 units with a standard deviation of 20.4. Currently, there are 122 units on-hand and 397 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend uses a service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 samples (recent_N=11) provides a stable forecast reflecting the observed mean and variance. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 28 units with 436 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P8). Historical demand from P1 to P12 shows a mean of approximately 114.5 units per period. The demand appears relatively stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals yet visible in the period-based dates. To cover the cycle of L+1 (5 periods), the required inventory (base stock) is approximately 114.5 * 5 = 572.5 plus a safety buffer. Currently, our pipeline (On-hand 28 + In-transit 436 = 464) is below the expected demand over the lead time. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to rely on the consistent history of L=4, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample mean and variance for stability, as no distinct recent changepoint is evident.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 75 units, and in-transit inventory is 448 units. Historical data from Period 5 to Period 13 confirms that the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility without a clear seasonal or regime shift, ranging between 73 and 144 units per period. The average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 109 units. To capture recent variability while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock (calculated as (1+L) * mean) covers demand during the review plus lead-time period (5 periods total). With L=4, mu_hat will represent the expected demand over 5 periods (~545 units), and sigma_hat will account for the standard deviation across that window to buffer against stockouts given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 14. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without clear seasonal trends in the provided period history (P1-P14). The mean demand across all observed periods is approximately 111 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 20. Inventory on-hand (84) plus pipeline (409) totals 493 units. With an expected lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock level targeting 5 * 111 = 555 plus a safety stock buffer is appropriate. The OR backend will calculate the optimal service level using the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to utilize the stable history, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include all 14 samples, as no significant demand regime shift or seasonal pattern is yet evident.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in all arrivals from Period 5 through 15). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable without clear seasonal shifts or regime changes. The mean demand across the first 15 periods is approximately 111.4 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical data (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable estimation for this consistent demand pattern. Current pipeline inventory (395 in-transit) plus on-hand (75) equals 470 units, which is roughly 4.2 periods of mean demand, suggesting the OR backend will place a moderate order to maintain the service level.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the first 16 periods is approximately 105 units per period. However, in the most recent period (P16), we observed a significant drop to 41 units. Despite this outlier, the preceding periods (P12-P15) showed values around 136, 79, 107, and 122, suggesting high volatility rather than a sustained regime shift. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units and the pipeline is 443 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival from P5 to P16. To calculate OR parameters, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current volatility and mean while smoothing out the single low-demand period (P16). This provides a balanced view of demand over the last 10 periods (avg ~100-110 units) without overreacting to the P16 drop.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 167 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 305 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals up to Period 17 (order from Period 13 arrived in Period 17). Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without a clear regime shift: the average demand over the last 17 periods is approximately 104.5 units, with the most recent 10 periods averaging 95.6 units. Since there is no significant evidence of a shift, I will use a larger N to capture the underlying mean. The current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 472 units, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand at the current average, aligning well with the 5-period cycle (L+1). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=15 to balance stability and recent fluctuations.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts. Over the last 18 periods, demand fluctuated between 41 and 144 units, with a mean around 107. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders (Periods 1 through 14). Total pipeline inventory is 315 units (ordered in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18), and current on-hand inventory is 115. To maintain service levels while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am using a recent_N approach for demand and standard lead time calculations. N=18 is chosen as it covers the observed history after the initial startup phase while remaining sensitive to any subtle drift. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with an average demand of approximately 104 units over the first 19 periods. However, recent periods (P16 and P19) have shown significant dips to 41 units, while other recent periods like P18 remained high (129). This suggests possible high volatility or a subtle shift in demand patterns. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5 through P19). Current on-hand inventory is 173 and in-transit is 367, totaling a pipeline inventory of 540. With L=4, the review+lead window is 5 periods. Expected demand over this window (5 * 104 = 520) is slightly lower than the current pipeline, but to maintain a safe service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand mean and standard deviation, covering approximately two full lead-time cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promise). Demand for chips(Regular) appears reasonably stable with fluctuations between 41 and 144 units per period. The mean demand across all 20 periods is approximately 104.5 units, though recent periods show higher volatility (Period 19: 41, Period 20: 133). On-hand inventory is 169, with in-transit totaling 238 (orders from P17=0 units, P18=87 units, P19=151 units, P20=0 units). Total pipeline + on-hand is 407. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last 15 samples (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a better representation of recent demand distribution compared to the full history which includes the initial start-up periods. The choice of N=15 balances stability with sensitivity to the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the order placed in Period 17 failed to arrive as expected (promised lead time is 4 periods). This is confirmed by the 'arrived=0' message in the Period 21 conclude report, whereas an arrival was due from Period 17 (though Period 17's order quantity was 0, a conclude message would still typically trigger if the lead time was fulfilled). More critically, the system is now stocked out (On-hand: 0) facing a potential lead-time disruption or lost stock. I need to maintain a robust pipeline. The demand in Period 21 spiked to 192, significantly higher than the previous average (~100). Given the stockout and the high demand spike, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent upward trend. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance, but stay alert for the missing Period 17/18 arrival sequence if further stock fails to arrive.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing supply instability. The order from Period 17 (138 units) is officially lost as it did not arrive in Period 21 or 22 (lead time 4 and 5 respectively), corroborated by the fact that the Period 18 order arrived in Period 22 as expected (lead time 4). This loss, combined with high demand in Period 21 (192), has resulted in zero on-hand inventory and back-to-back stockouts. The demand mean from Period 1 to 20 was ~102, but recent volatility (P21 = 192) suggests a need for a slightly more responsive forecast. I am using recent_N (N=15) for demand to capture recent variation while smoothing the P21 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful deliveries. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history while monitoring for further losses.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 17 (138 units) confirmed lost: P18 order arrived on schedule (P22) but P17 did not.

This loss, combined with high demand in Period 21 (192), led to stockouts in Periods 21 and 22. The pipeline currently shows 457 units in-transit (Orders from P21, P22, P23). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the start of the game, the demand mean is approximately 107 units per period with a standard deviation of 34 (based on Periods 1-23). To recover from the lost shipment and ensure high service levels, I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for demand estimation to capture recent variability more accurately than the full history, as the backend's capped policy will handle the replenishment logic. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we have 88 units on-hand and 505 units in-transit. A review of history confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods. However, a significant disruption occurred: the order from Period 17 was lost, which caused stockouts in Periods 21 and 22. The system has since recovered following arrivals from Period 18 and 19. Demand has been highly variable recently, including a spike of 192 (P21) followed by a period of zero demand (P24). To handle this volatility and the previous lost shipment, I am using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current regime which includes higher peaks. I will keep L at 'calculate' as the actual lead time has consistently been 4 when shipments arrive. The target is to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $535.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high variance and potential regime shifts. Mean demand across all available samples (including the seed data) is approximately 107 units per period. Recently (last 10 periods), the average is around 94. However, Period 25 saw a spike to 155, and Period 21 saw 192. Given the lead time (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). A critical loss was identified at Period 23: the shipment from Period 17 never arrived, causing stockouts in Periods 21 and 22. The in-transit inventory of 353 units accounts for orders from Period 22 (210), Period 23 (95), and Period 24 (48). Order 22 is expected to arrive in Period 26 (current). Because of the stockout history and the loss of the P17 shipment, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while remaining responsive to the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to the default to capture full historical variance for safety stock calculation, which is necessary given the demonstrated risk of shipment loss and high demand spikes.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but remains range-bound around historical averages. Period 25 saw a demand of 155, while Period 26 dropped to 21. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is approximately 81.3 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Carry-over insights confirm that the Period 17 shipment was lost, which the OR backend might not account for when calculating pipeline inventory. Therefore, maintaining a buffer is essential. Current on-hand inventory is 274, and in-transit is 246 (comprising orders from P23: 95, P24: 48, P25: 0, and P26: 103). I will use L=4 (promised) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture recent demand trends while smoothing out the extreme low in Period 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-144.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 28. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost shipment from Period 17. The demand has shown high volatility recently (ranging from 0 to 192), but there is no clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift evident from the available 'Period_N' dates. The mean demand across all 27 periods is approximately 101.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (324 units) following the arrival of P23's order. In-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 24 (48 units), Period 25 (0 units), Period 26 (103 units), and Period 27 (55 units), totaling 206 units. Given the inventory level is sufficient to cover about 3 periods of average demand and the pipeline is well-stocked, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the recent high-variance behavior while relying on the backend's calculation for lead time. This balances the high service level requirement (80% critical ratio) with the current high on-hand stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 26-28) has shown a significant decrease (21, 45, 90) compared to the higher volatility observed in the Period 21-25 range. However, demand for chips is generally stable. The mean demand of all samples (including the initial ones) is approximately 104 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (282 units) due to the large order from Period 22 arriving during a low-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The the pipeline inventory is 186 (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for demand and standard deviation to capture the recent high volatility (Period 21-25) while acknowledging the current slowdown, ensuring we don't over-order while inventory is high. This window covers both the spike and the dip.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., Period 28 saw arrival of Period 24's order). A significant loss occurred at Period 17, which previously disrupted inventory flow, but the system has since stabilized. Demand has shown high volatility recently (Period 21: 192, Period 24: 0, Period 26: 21). Looking at the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the mean demand is 83.7 units per period, which is lower than the long-term average (approx 103). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N=10 to reflect this lower demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the inherent volatility. The pipeline inventory (253) and on-hand (241) are currently high, so the OR backend will likely mitigate the order size through the base-stock logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 168 units. There are 191 units in-transit: specific orders from Period 27 (55), Period 28 (28), Period 29 (67), and Period 30 (41). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P26 arrived P30). Demand has been volatile recently (varying from 0 to 176 in the last 10 periods), but the overall mean remains stable. Since profit ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=10) to capture the current volatility while maintaining the standard lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but maintains a relatively stable mean around 100-110 units when looking at recent history (excluding the extremely low outlier of 21 and the high of 192). Period 30 showed a spike to 176, but Period 31 returned to 101. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P26, P27 arrivals). I have accounted for the lost shipment from Period 17 previously. Current inventory (on-hand 122 + in-transit 334 = 456) needs to cover approximately 5 periods (L+1) of demand. With an average demand around 104 and some buffer for volatility (sigma), 456 units is adequate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime which seems more volatile than the initial stages. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $525.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised and actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from periods 26, 27, and 28). There was a lost shipment from Period 25 (ordered Period 25, expected Period 29, but no 'conclude' message yet), which has caused the current on-hand inventory to drop to 15. The demand mean has shown some fluctuations lately but appears to be re-stabilizing around the long-term average. To ensure recovery from the likely lost Period 25 shipment and meet the (L+1)=5 period demand requirement, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=12 to capture recent variability including some higher demand spikes (e.g., Period 30) while smoothing out the zero-demand outlier in Period 24. Since the in-transit inventory (351) already includes orders from Periods 29-32, the backend will calculate the necessary replenishment to bridge the gap created by the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Likely lost shipment at Period 25: Order placed in P25 (0 units?) should have arrived P29. Note: P25 order was 0, but P29 arrival was also 0. P30 arrival confirmed P26 order. This suggests no inventory gap from P25 itself, but the pipeline needs to be monitored for the P29 order arrival in P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 33, where demand (147) exceeded available supply (82). The promised lead time remains 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout history (Period 29 order arrived in Period 33). Pipeline inventory is currently 479 units, consisting of orders from Periods 30 (41), 31 (198), 32 (45), and 33 (195). Given the stockout and the high demand in recent periods (P30: 176, P32: 135, P33: 147), a shift in demand regime is observed. Calculating mu_hat over the last 10 periods (avg ~90-100) or 5 periods (avg ~120) suggests a higher base stock requirement. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility and volume while ensuring the pipeline is replenished to meet a service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed around Period 30: Average demand has increased noticeably compared to the early-game mean, leading to recent stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a demand regime shift and recent stockouts. Demand since Period 30 has averaged approximately 145 units per period (176, 101, 135, 147, 167), significantly higher than the earlier game average of ~100. Both Period 33 and 34 ended with 0 inventory due to this surge. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 periods of elevated demand) to capture this new mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 34 conclude' (P30 order arrived on time). Pipeline inventory is 531, which is substantial, but since on-hand is 0, we must ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated L+1 (5 periods) demand of roughly 725 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the recent volatility and higher mean to recover service levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment for chips(Regular) shows a confirmed demand regime shift around Period 30. The early game (P1-P29) mean was approximately 97 units per period, whereas the recent mean (P30-P35) has increased to approximately 143 units per period. This shift led to stockouts in Periods 33 and 34. To capture this increase while remaining responsive, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6, which covers the start of the new regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding known losses like P17). The in-transit inventory is high (527 units), but given several recent orders were large (e.g., P33-P35 orders), it is critical to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand to maintain service levels and recover from the low ending inventory of 67 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 30-35 average demand increased to ~143 units from previous average of ~97 (+47%).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward starting around Period 30. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 134 units, compared to the earlier historical average of ~97. Recent periods (P33, P34) experienced stockouts despite arrivals, confirming the need for a higher base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P35 and P36). With On-hand at 26 and a large In-transit pipeline of 654 units (orders from P33 forward), the goal is to maintain this higher service level using the recent demand data. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this new regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 37 is approximately 141.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~97 units. Period 37 demand was particularly high at 192 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. With current on-hand inventory at 29 and a high in-transit pipeline (515 units), the supply chain is responding to the higher demand, but we must maintain parameters that reflect this new higher-mean, higher-variance state to avoid further stockouts (as seen in P33-P34). I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Periods 30-37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system is managing a confirmed demand regime shift that began around Period 30. Recent demand (P30-P38) has shown higher volatility and a higher mean compared to early periods, with several spikes near or exceeding 170 units (P30, P34, P37), though P38 saw an anomalous low of 6 units. The Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods. Since P30, excluding the outlier P38, the mean demand is approximately 144 units. Including P38, the 9-period mean is ~121. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture this transition while respecting the recent volatility. The in-transit pipeline is currently 624 units, which is healthy against a lead-time demand (L+1=5) of approximately 600-700 units. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to adjust to the higher service level required by the recent regime shift while incorporating the P38 dip into the variance calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a confirmed regime shift starting around Period 30. The mean demand for Periods 30-39 is approximately 122 units per period, but with significant volatility (highs of 192, lows of 6). Compared to the pre-P30 average of ~97, this is a clear increase. Current on-hand inventory is 229, and there are 431 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend targets an ~80% service level. To capture the recent demand increase and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the most recent regime shift while maintaining enough samples to cushion against the high variance seen in the last 10 periods (e.g., P37 demand was 192, P38 was 6).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and a higher mean since Period 30. While the early-game mean was around 97, the average since Period 30 is approximately 128 units, with peaks reaching 192. Recent demand (P38-P40) has slowed slightly (6, 81, 58), but given the history of stockouts and the lead time of 4 periods, we must maintain a robust base stock. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 343 units, with 315 units in-transit (P37: 56, P38: 202, P39: 1, P40: 56). Total pipeline is 658 units. To account for the recent structural shift since P30 (11 periods ago), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for both demand mean and volatility calculation. This provides the OR engine with the most relevant local statistics to navigate the remaining 10 periods while balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 30, with a significant increase in both mean and volatility. Recently (P38-P41), the observed demand has cooled down (6, 81, 58, 83), averaging ~57 units over the last 4 periods, which is a sharp contrast to the ~143 average seen between P30-P35. However, the overall regime remains more volatile than the early game. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current On-hand (316) and In-transit (289) inventory totals 605 units, which is ample to cover roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the current average, but the OR backend's target base-stock must account for the high volatility. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior (starting from P30) while smoothing out the most recent low-demand outliers to avoid under-ordering if demand spikes again. This balances the risk of holding costs against potential stockouts during the final 9 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 30, though the most recent 4 periods (P38-P41) show a temporary slowdown (avg ~57) compared to the P30-P35 peak (avg ~143).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-453.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift was identified around Period 30 (averaging ~143 units), the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) have seen a sharp decline to an average of ~48 units (6, 81, 58, 83, 13). This suggests the previous high-demand regime may have ended or was a temporary peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (505 units) due to those lower demand periods and the arrival of a large order from Period 38 (202 units). With 152 in-transit units and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, current total coverage (on-hand + in-transit) is 657 units. Given the recent average demand of ~48, this covers over 13 periods, well above the L+1 (5 period) safety requirement. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 13 periods (P30-P42) to capture both the peak and the recent cooling (avg ~90), while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this timeframe. This approach avoids over-ordering while maintaining a buffer against another sudden spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand cooled significantly from ~143 (P30-P35) to ~48 (P38-P42), a 66% decrease.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Periods 30-37, demand averaged ~143 units, but since Period 38, it has cooled considerably, averaging 55.6 units over the last 6 periods (P38-P43: 6, 81, 58, 83, 13, 137). Period 43 saw a sharp spike back to 137, but the overall trend remains much lower than the mid-game peak. With 369 units on-hand and 151 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42 totaling 56+30+65), we are currently overstocked relative to the recent low-demand regime. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs while protecting against the volatility seen in P43, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower demand average (~56/period), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-425.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 with a high on-hand inventory of 425 units and 95 units in-transit. The recent demand regime (starting P38) has been significantly lower (~57 avg) and highly volatile compared to the P30-P35 peak (~143 avg). Period 44 saw zero demand, following a decent 137 in P43 and very low numbers in P38-P42. Given the game ends at Period 50, we must avoid over-ordering to minimize excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a sufficient service level for potential demand spikes. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since on-hand (425) already covers more than 7 periods of the current average demand (~57), the OR backend should ideally not place new orders. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the high-demand period to the current cooling phase, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the lower recent average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 38: sequences of very low demand (0, 13, 6) are punctuated by occasional moderate demand (137), suggesting a 'lumpy' demand pattern in the final stretch.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a 'lumpy' demand pattern observed since Period 38. Demand remains highly volatile, with recent periods showing values of 137, 0, and 163. The average demand since the cooldown at Period 38 (P38-P45) is approximately 67.6 units, but with a very high variance. We currently have a high on-hand inventory of 292 units and a pipeline of 65 units (ordered P42, expected arrival P46). Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and the high inventory level (292) already covers over 4 periods of the current average demand (67.6 * 4 = 270.4), the primary concern is minimizing holding costs. The OR backend needs to recognize the recent demand shift and the 'lumpy' nature of current sales to avoid over-ordering in the final periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-P38 average and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lumpy demand regime confirmed (P38-P45): Demand oscillates between extremes (0 to 163) with an average of ~68 units, significantly lower than the P30-P37 peak (~140).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a 'lumpy' demand regime (Period 38-46) with high volatility (range 0-163). The average demand in this recent period is approximately 67 units (605 total / 9 periods). Although the peak demand in Period 45 was 163, the overall average has dropped significantly from the Period 30-37 high (~140). On-hand inventory is currently high (293 units), and there are 96 units in-transit (ordered Period 46). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), our current total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 389) is sufficient to cover expected demand (~67 units/period) for the remainder of the game, even considering the 4-period lead time. No new orders are likely needed, but we will set parameters to reflect the current lumpy regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lumpy behavior (P38-P46) and ensure the OR backend maintains a safe but not excessive base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The game ends in 2 periods. Currently, we have 168 units on-hand and 150 units in-transit (ordered in P46 and P47). Given the lead time is 4 periods, the orders placed in P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50 will NOT arrive before the game ends (P50 conclusion). Therefore, placing orders now only incurs costs without any possibility of generating revenue. Inventory management for the final periods should transition to a 'run-down' strategy. The current on-hand inventory of 168 units is sufficient to cover the expected 'lumpy' demand (avg ~68, but recently volatile) for the final two periods (P48 and P49 demand events). Our priority is to avoid holding costs on excess stock that cannot be sold. I will set the base stock logic to ensure no new orders are placed by using the 'recent_N' method for the lower demand regime (P38-P47) to reflect the current mean, while keeping parameters such that the pipeline + on-hand already exceeds requirements. In practice, the backend will see the high inventory vs. the target and order 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are approaching the final period (Period 50). The current inventory position is high: 112 units on-hand and 304 units in-transit. The demand regime (Period 38-48) is characterized as 'lumpy' with an average of approximately 71 units (781 total / 11 periods). The most recent demand (Period 48) was 56 units. With only 2 periods left until the game's conclusion (Period 49 and 50), the primary goal is to minimize holding costs while ensuring we don't stock out. Current on-hand inventory (112) is likely sufficient for Period 49's demand. Arrivals from Period 43 and 44 (which were both 0) are expected during the arrival resolution of Period 47 and 48, though no arrival occurred in P47/P48, consistent with the 0-unit orders. The 96 units ordered in P46 are expected to arrive in Period 50. Given the high pipeline and enough on-hand stock for the likely immediate demand, I will use a recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the current 'lumpy' regime and default settings for others to ensure the OR backend maintains a conservative ordering policy for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Lumpy demand regime (P38-P48) average demand confirmed at ~71 units, characterized by high variance and frequent extremes.

Daily Profit: $448.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment is characterized by a 'lumpy' demand regime that began around Period 38. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 49 (demand was 148, but only 112 were available). However, there is a large pipeline inventory of 347 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The demand since Period 38 has averaged approximately 71 units, but with significant swings (0 to 163). To address this volatility while acknowledging the lower average compared to the P30-P37 peak, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=12 (covering the period from P38 to P49) to capture the current lumpy mean of ~71 (which results in a base stock target covering ~355 units over 1+L periods). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=12) to account for the high volatility observed in this specific regime. This setup helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) while not over-ordering based on the older, higher demand peak.
