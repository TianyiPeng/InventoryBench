Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no historical arrival data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time method. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [112, 111, 80, 129, 130], averaging 112.4. Since demand shows relatively stable behavior but with a slight upward trend in the last two periods, I will use all 5 available samples to set the initial demand forecast. With L=4 (promised), the planning horizon (L+1) is 5 periods. Using 'default' will calculate the forecast as (1+4) * mean(112.4) = 562. This provides a baseline while we wait for the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 146 units, and faced a demand of 63, resulting in 63 units of lost sales because the order did not arrive in the same period (promised lead time is 4). There is 146 in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Since we only have historical demand for 5 periods (from the prompt: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130) and the observation of Period 1 (demand=63), the demand is somewhat volatile but currently averaging around 104 units per period across all 6 observations. Since we have no confirmed lead-time data yet (P1 order is still in transit), I will use 'default' for L. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent samples including the 63 from Period 1, as the game's recent history might be more representative than the seed data. This helps set a base stock that covers the pipeline while respecting the holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) averaged ~112 units. However, observed demand in P1 (63) and P2 (70) is significantly lower, suggesting a lower regime or initial noise. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from P1 (146 units) and P2 (152 units) are in-transit (Total 298). No units have arrived yet, which is expected given L=4 (P1 order should arrive at P5). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2. To stabilize, I will use recent_N for demand forecasting based on the first two game periods plus the last few samples, but I'll lean towards the lower observed demand to avoid overstocking while waiting for the lead time to resolve. Given the early stage and lack of arrival data, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units), Period 2 (152 units), and Period 3 (149 units) are all still in-transit, which is consistent with the promised lead time (P1 order expected to arrive in Period 5, visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but this is unavoidable given the lead time. Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) shows an average of 112.4. However, the game history for Periods 1-3 shows demand of 63, 70, and 136. Combining these 8 points, the mean is approximately 103.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the more recent variability (including the jump to 136 in Period 3) while relying on 'default' for lead time since we have no completed arrivals yet to suggest a drift from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units), Period 2 (152 units), Period 3 (149 units), and Period 4 (149 units) are all in-transit (Total 596). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals so far is expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so we have lost sales for the first 4 periods. Demand has been fluctuating (63, 70, 136, 71) with an average of approximately 85. I will use the default lead time of 4. Since the demand shows some volatility but no clear trend yet, I will use all 5 available samples (including the initial history provided) for mean and standard deviation to stabilize the inventory level as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of 'Period 5 conclude' confirms that the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5, resulting in an actual lead time of 4 periods (5-1=4), which matches the promise. The demand history across 5 periods (63, 70, 136, 71, 94) indicates a mean of approximately 87 units per period. Currently, we have 52 units on hand and 450 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since we only have 5 samples, I will use all available history (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The OR backend will use these to maintain the base stock level across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). High in-transit inventory relative to demand suggests the cap will likely limit further large orders to prevent overstocking.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Orders from Periods 1 and 2 arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, 298 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 3 and 4, each 149 units). On-hand inventory is 122 units. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been: 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82. The mean demand is approximately 86. Based on a lead time (L) of 4, the target window is L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~430. Current total inventory (On-hand 122 + In-transit 298) is 420, which is close to the requirement. Demand spiked in Period 3 (136) but has stabilized between 70-95 in recent periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most relevant demand activity after the initial noise, setting L to default (4) as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been: 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129. Pre-game samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) were significantly higher than the early in-game demand, but levels seem to be stabilizing around an average of 91 units in the actual game rounds. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the conclusion messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7). Currently, we have 142 units on hand and 262 units in transit (expected arrivals in P8, P9, and P11). Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the in-game demand is lower and more volatile than the seed data, so I will use a window of the last 7 samples (N=7) to better capture the actual environment demand mean and variance while smoothing out the early period fluctuations.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages for Periods 5 through 8 confirms that the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). This matches the promised lead time of 4. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 8 observed periods, with a mean demand of approximately 93.88 units and a standard deviation of about 26.68. The current on-hand inventory is 185 units, and in-transit inventory is 225 units (from orders in P7 and P8). Using the promised lead time of L=4, the base stock targets demand over L+1=5 periods. My parameters aim to maintain this coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available post-start data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised value.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with a lead time of 4). In Period 9, no arrival was expected because no order was placed in Period 5. The next arrival (from P7) is expected in Period 11. Demand over the 9 recorded periods shows a mean of approximately 90.89 units (63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129, 106, 67). I will use L=4 (default). For mu_hat, since the demand is relatively stable but shows some variance, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture all available history while the system stabilizes. This will compute mu_hat as (1+4) * mean(last 9), which is approx 5 * 90.89 \u2248 454. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed standard deviation across this sample.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 24 units and an in-transit pipeline of 388 units. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrivals from Periods 1 through 4 (all arrived exactly 4 periods later in Periods 5 through 8). Since Period 5, new orders were placed at Period 7, 8, 9, and 10. Given the lead time of 4, the Period 7 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 11. Demand history shows a reasonably stable pattern without clear seasonal shifts (mean demand ~101). I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), the last 10 periods of data provide a representative sample (N=10), accounting for the full history since start. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 will capture the current variability while providing a stable base stock target for the OR backend to maintain service levels while managing the relatively high holding cost (1/4 of profit).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P11). The on-hand inventory is 51, and the in-transit pipeline is 368. Demand has been relatively stable over the last 11 periods, with an average of approximately 90.7 units. Specifically, looking at the last 5 samples (P7-P11), the mean is 96.4. I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed) and mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the most recent demand levels while keeping the calculation window large enough to mitigate noise. Sigma_hat will be calculated using all available history to provide a robust safety stock buffer. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that accounts for 5 periods of demand (1+L), ensuring sufficient stock through the arrival lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P7 arrived P11, P8 arrived P12). Order arrivals resumed as expected after the gap in Periods 5 and 6 when no orders were placed. Current demand is relatively stable but shows fluctuation. Using the full 12-period history (including provided samples P_1 to P_5) for demand mean and standard deviation provides a robust estimate. Demand mean (P1-P12) is approximately 88.6 units. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 443 units). Current inventory position (On-hand 98 + In-transit 366 = 464) is slightly above this target, so default parameters will maintain a safe service level while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P1-P5, P2-P6, P3-P7, P4-P8, P7-P11, P8-P12, P9-P13). Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable. The mean demand over the last 8 periods (Period 6 to 13) is 89.25, while the mean over all 13 periods is 90.6. There is no evidence of a regime shift, but recent fluctuations are within a normal range (65-129). With On-hand inventory at 125 and In-transit at 316, the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time. I will maintain L at the promised 4 periods and use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the 4:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 40 units with 310 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals from Period 1 to Period 10 (all arriving precisely 4 periods later). Demand over the first 14 periods has been relatively stable around a mean of 91.7. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has been slightly more volatile with a spike to 136 in Period 14, but the 14-period average remains the most robust predictor given the absence of seasonal calendar data. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all 14 historical samples to ensure the backend base-stock calculation (covering 1+L=5 periods) remains grounded in the observed mean and variance, effectively balancing the 4:1 profit to holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations. Over the first 15 periods, demand has averaged approximately 90.6 units (sum: 1359), with the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 85.2 units and the 5 periods before that (P6-P10) averaging 83.2 units. There is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift, so I will use a larger sample size (N=15) for Mean and Std to provide stability. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, L=4 is reliable. Current on-hand is 81 with 357 units in transit. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target [ (1+L) * mean ] and order the difference between that target and current pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16). The promised lead time is also 4, so the 'default' method for L is appropriate. Demand over the last 16 periods has fluctuated between 52 and 136, with a mean around 90. Recent demand (Periods 14-16) was 136, 52, and 88, averaging 92. Since there is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift or seasonal spike in the data provided, using a window of N=10 for demand statistics is a stable approach to capture recent behavior while smoothing out noise. The current on-hand inventory is 103 and in-transit is 306. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the current decision period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 79, and the in-transit pipeline is 340 units (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5-8 and 11-17 consistently matching the 4-period promise). Demand for the last 17 periods shows a mean of approximately 88 units per period without a distinct structural shift (P1-P5 samples were slightly different, but the overall mean remains stable). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as observations consistently align with the promised 4 periods. For 'mu_hat', I'll use a 'recent_N' of 10 to capture the current demand cluster (avg ~89), which covers the (1+L)=5 period lead time window. For 'sigma_hat', I will also use 'recent_N' of 10 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $466.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) after Period 18, and demand has been fluctuating around an average of 91 units over the last 18 periods. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods (L=4). To prevent a stockout,/ we need to maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). Over the last 10 periods (P9-P18), the average daily demand is approximately 87.7 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this more recent demand level while smoothing out the volatility observed in earlier periods. The current in-transit inventory is 353, which is substantial, but given the low on-hand stock and the 4-period lead time, the OR backend needs to ensure the next arrivals (ordered P15-P18) bridge the gap to avoid lost sales.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with an average around 90 units (last 5 periods: 52, 88, 86, 118, 86). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-8, 11-19). Currently, we have 60 units on hand and 340 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P16, P17, P18, and P19). To maintain a proper base stock while balancing the holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4), I am using a recent 5-period average for demand (recent_N with N=5) to capture the current demand level. The lead time (L) is set to the promised/observed value of 4 periods using the calculate method, which will use historical arrival data.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 20 (actual L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 47 units, with 355 units in-transit. Demand over the last 20 periods has fluctuated between 52 and 136, with an average of approximately 88.5 units. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock levels should target approximately 5 * 88.5 = 442.5 units. With current on-hand (47) + pipeline (355) = 402 units, the system will likely place a small replenishment order. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable historical demand pattern while smoothing out noise.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 22. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean with no clear seasonal trend or regime shift. The average demand over the last 21 periods is approximately 89 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is 31 units, and in-transit inventory is 350 units. Orders from periods 18 (58), 19 (127), 20 (74), and 21 (91) are currently in transit, totaling 350 units. Given the promised lead time L=4 and the stability of the demand, I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=20 to capture the most recent stable regime while providing sufficient smoothing. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (4+1=5) periods of demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' currently has 0 units on-hand after stocking out in Period 22 (demand was 102, only 89 units were available). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P14 at P18, P15 at P19, P16 at P20, P17 at P21, P18 at P22). The pipeline inventory is high (416 units), consisting of orders from Period 19 (127), Period 20 (74), Period 21 (91), and Period 22 (124). Based on the lead time of 4, the order from Period 19 (127 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 23 and be reflected in the next period's observation. Demand has been relatively consistent with an average around 90-100 recently, but spiked slightly to 112 and 102 in the last two periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'default' for L since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

The on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units). The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insight and recent arrivals from Periods 15-19). Total in-transit inventory is 387 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of demand at the current rate (93.3 * 4 = 373.2). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime from Period 9 to 23 (Mean \u2248 93.3, resulting in mu_hat \u2248 466.5 for L+1=5). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect the observed volatility in this period (Std Dev \u2248 23, resulting in sigma_hat \u2248 51.4 for sqrt(5)). This approach maintains a consistent safety stock given the 80% critical ratio (Profit=4, Holding=1; q = 4/5 = 0.8).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 24, demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but slightly elevated compared to the early periods, with the most recent three periods (P22-P24) averaging 117 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every concluding delivery (P5-P8, P11-P24). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding the expected arrivals in P22 and P24. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 413 units covers the orders from P21 (91), P22 (124), P23 (98), and P24 (100). To ensure we return to a healthy stock level and cover the lead time + review period (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand mean of ~102 units/period, and sigma_hat with N=10 to account for recent volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all historical arrivals (P1-P21). Current inventory state is 0 units on-hand with 438 units in-transit. Demand since Period 21 has shown a relative increase (avg ~112.4), leading to stockouts in Periods 22, 24, and 25. To recover and maintain an appropriate service level based on the critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.80), I will use the recent demand regime (last 10 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput observed in recent periods (Demand avg Period 16-25 \u2248 100) compared to the long-term average (Demand avg Period 1-25 \u2248 93.6). L is set to calculated as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed since Period 7). The product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable but slightly fluctuating demand pattern. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 101 units per period, which is higher than the overall average but reflects current market conditions better. There have been stockouts in Periods 22, 24, and 25 due to demand exceeding on-hand inventory, despite consistent arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 40 units, with 419 units in transit. To prevent further stockouts and maintain a healthy service level, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture the recent higher demand variance while keeping L at the established 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable upward shift. Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 104.2, compared to the overall average of 93.3. Specifically, demand in the most recent 10 periods (P18-P27) has been higher and more volatile (mean: 101.5, std: 19.3). The 'In-transit' quantity of 403 units reflects orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27 (100+116+105+82 = 403), which confirms that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have experienced stockouts recently (P22, P24, P25), I am adopting a more aggressive demand forecast. I will use a 'recent_N' of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility, while keeping the lead time at the default promised value of 4 as the actual lead time is consistently matching it.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 18: recent 10-period avg increased to 101.5 from previous levels (~90).

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified at Period 28 is sustained, with recent demand (Periods 18-28) averaging 101.5 units compared to the earlier average of approximately 90. In the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28), the mean demand is 92.4, but given the stockouts in P22, P24, and P25, the true demand is likely higher than observed sales. I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking back to Period 18) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P21 order arrived P25, P22 order arrived P26, etc.). Current on-hand is 61 with 393 in-transit, which covers the expected (L+1) horizon of demand. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures we account for current volatility in this higher demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 30. Looking at the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from Periods 24 and 25 arriving in Periods 28 and 29 respectively). Demand analysis shows a sustained shift that began around Period 18. Calculating the demand mean for the last 12 periods (P18-P29: 118, 86, 72, 112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84, 89, 88, 95) results in an average of approximately 99.6, which is higher than the long-term average (previous level was ~90). This confirms the regime shift noted in Period 28's insight. Therefore, I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while maintaining enough samples for variance calculation. I will keep L at its promised/calculated value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P18-P29 average demand is 99.6 compared to early period average of ~90 (+10%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods. Analysis of the demand from Period 18 to Period 30 shows an average demand of approximately 100.1 units (1301 total demand over 13 periods), confirming the shift from the earlier average of ~90 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 30. Current on-hand inventory is 90 units with 345 units in-transit. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) lead time window (5 periods) while accounting for this slightly higher demand mean and maintaining a high service level given the profit margin (75% based on $4 profit/$1 holding), I will use the last 13 samples (N=13) to capture the current demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. The lead time parameter L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time and has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 18, increasing from an early mean of ~90 to nearly 100. However, the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show a slight cooling or stabilization (95, 97, 69), with Period 31 being particularly low. To avoid overreacting to one low demand point while accounting for the sustained higher regime since P18, I am using a recent_N window of 14 periods (P18-P31) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire high-demand regime, yielding a representative mean and capturing the volatility seen in the stockouts of P22-P25. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history, so I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize the backend average restricted by historical consistency. The current on-hand (103) and in-transit (357) are relatively high, so these parameters will allow the OR backend to modulate the order size down if the safety stock level is currently satisfied.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units since the regime shift identified around Period 18. Average demand from P18 to P32 is approximately 96 units, though recent local peaks were higher. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple concluding arrival messages (P24 arriving P28, P25 arriving P29, etc.). Pipeline inventory (328) combined with on-hand (96) covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand (at a rate of 100/period). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. With a 50-period game and current Period 33, we are well into the second half. I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand (covering the regime from P18 onwards) and explicit lead time of 4 to ensure the backend uses the most accurate observed delay. This configuration aims to maintain high service levels while managing holding costs for this medium-margin product.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified around Period 18 continues to hold. The average demand from Period 18 to Period 33 is approximately 97.5 units, which is a clear increase over the initial baseline of ~90 units. Recent performance (last 16 periods) reflects this sustained higher demand level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P28 arrived P32, P29 arrived P33). I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=16 to capture the current demand regime (P18-P33). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=16 to account for the volatility in this specific regime. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is consistent with observations.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 18. The average demand from Period 18 to Period 34 is approximately 99.1 units. The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) have shown a consistent mean of 95.2. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 56 and in-transit units at 365, the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time. However, to maintain the desired service level (critical as profit $4 >> holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (from P18 onwards) to capture the higher demand regime accurately without being overly influenced by the lower initial periods. I use N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this shift.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 18. Comparing the initial periods (P1-P17 avg ~87) to the recent regime (P18-P35 avg ~99), there is a clear sustained increase. The most recent 5 samples (P31-P35: 69, 97, 111, 102, 96) average 95, but the 18-period regime (P18-P35) average is 99.1. I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture this sustained higher demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P31-P35 arrivals all show L=4). Pipeline inventory (373) and on-hand (54) are being tracked; the OR backend will calculate the order based on the base stock derived from these parameters. Setting L to default (which is the promised 4) and using recent_N for mu and sigma based on the current regime (N=18) ensures we account for the higher mean and volatility of the current state.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 18. The average demand from Period 18 to Period 36 is approximately 98.4 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~90. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly higher at ~103.6. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 407 units, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Currently, the pipeline of 407 units plus 3 units on-hand (410 total) is sufficient to cover 5 periods of demand at the current rate (roughly 500 units needed for safety). However, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic will handle the specific order quantity based on the parameters provided. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (matching the start of the regime shift at P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately while providing enough history for stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Period 18-36 average demand is 98.4 (+9% vs early periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P18-P37) shows an average of approximately 99 units per period, which is a clear shift from the earlier average of ~90. Period 37 ended with 0 inventory despite an arrival of 95 units, as demand (110) exceeded-on hand, indicating a slight stockout risk. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations. To account for the sustained higher demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the shift starting at Period 18 and provides a larger sample size for stability while excluding the lower-demand early phase. This helps the OR backend project a base stock that better reflects current consumer behavior for this SKU.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 18 and has remained higher. The average demand from Period 18 to Period 38 is approximately 98.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 16.5 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38), demand has averaged 99.8 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P33 order arrived P37, P34 order arrived P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the last two periods, though a large in-transit pipeline (413 units) is expected to cover future periods. Using recent_N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire elevated demand regime (P18-P38) to provide a stable forecast while reflecting the increased mean. Since profit ($4) >> holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate given recent stockouts.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 18) shows a sustained mean of approximately 98 units per period, while the earlier periods (1-17) averaged around 90. The most recent 3 samples (P37-P39) are 110, 117, and 91, averaging 106, which might signal a further increase, but to maintain stability, I will use a window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current regime more accurately (starting from Period 20). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the history (every order from P1 to P35 has arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is low (11 units), but 430 units are in-transit, and the next arrival (115 units from Period 36) is expected this period. Using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accommodates the higher demand variance and mean observed in the latter half of the game.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 31 to 40 (last 10 samples) shows a mean of 99.5 and a standard deviation of 13.9. This confirms the sustained demand regime shift identified around Period 18, where demand transitioned from ~90 to approximately 100 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on all recent 'conclude' messages (P33-P36 arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) with a pipeline of 422 units (roughly 4 periods of demand). To maintain the target service level and account for the observed demand level, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current regime's statistics accurately. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4, as actual performance matches this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 31-40 average demand is 99.5 (\u03c3=13.9), confirming the sustained increase from early-game levels (~90).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher regime of approximately 100 units per period starting from Period 18. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41) is 106.5 with a standard deviation of 9.77. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P37 order in Period 41. I am setting L=4, mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture the recent higher demand (106.5 * (1+4) = 532.5), and sigma_hat using the same window (sqrt(5) * 9.77 approx 21.8). Current on-hand is 0, but total in-transit is 416, which plus a new order should cover the 5-period risk window (P42-P46).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P32-P41 average 106.5 (\u03c3=9.8), trending slightly higher than the Period 18-36 average.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early game, particularly evident since Period 18. Recent performance (P32-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 105.7 units per period, which is higher than the early average of 90. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P38 order arrived P42). On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), though a large pipeline of 437 units is in transit. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the backend targeting a ~80% service level is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the stabilized higher demand across the most recent regime (P32-42), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect recent volatility (~14.6) which is higher than earlier periods. Lead time will use 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Period 32-42 average demand is 105.7 units (\u03c3=14.6), compared to the early-game average of ~90 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to early periods. From Period 31 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 103.5 units with a standard deviation of 13.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed actual arrivals. As of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 34 units and in-transit inventory is 417 units (consisting of orders from P40:87, P41:109, P42:122, and P43:99). Since the pipeline is roughly 4 periods of demand, current parameters focus on maintaining this coverage. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the stabilization period from P31-P43) and 'calculate' for L to leverage the stable history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103.5 units (P31-P43 average) with \u03c3\u224813.1, up from early-game levels of ~90.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods. Since Period 18, the average demand has shifted from approximately 90 to 103. The most recent 14-period average (P31-P44) is approximately 101.4 units, though recent volatility has been high with the most recent demand being significantly lower (60) than the previous trend (~103-120). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), the backend will target an 80% service level. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 units. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture the stabilized higher-demand regime while excluding the very early data that would pull the forecast too low. On-hand is 61, and there is a significant pipeline of 411 units, which covers about 4 periods of demand, aligning with the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 101.4 units (P31-P44 average) and lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime. From Period 31 to 45, the average demand is 96.6 units, while the more recent Period 40-45 average is slightly lower at 84.8 due to sharp drops in Periods 44 and 45 (60 and 68 respectively). However, historical data shows frequent spikes above 110. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods left in the game (P46-P50), we must ensure enough inventory to cover the remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is 102 and in-transit is 354, totaling 456 units. Given the remaining 5 periods (including this one), an average demand of ~95 units would require 475 units. The OR backend uses the formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), so I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (L+1=5). I'll use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained higher regime since Period 31, which provides a balanced forecast of approximately 100 units per period (mu_hat \u2248 500).

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase since Period 18, stabilizing in the 100-110 range. Recent demand samples (P41-P46: 120, 93, 93, 60, 68, 113) show some volatility with an average of 91.1, though the broader regime since P31 averages 96.6. Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), and the inventory level is healthy (On-hand: 111, In-transit: 292), our primary goal is to maintain service levels without overstocking for the final 3 periods. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately (roughly P32-P46) while smoothing out the very recent dip in demand observed in P44 and P45. This N covers the period since the most recent stabilization noted in the carry-over insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18, with the most recent sample (P47: 97) consistent with the 100-110 units/period range observed lately. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will not arrive before the game ends. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage current pipeline inventory and target levels. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime (approx. P33-P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains at the default promised/calculated value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 18 and has remained in a higher regime ever since. Over the recent 10-period window (P39-P48), the average demand is approximately 93.5 units, which is lower than the previous mid-game peak of ~106 but still higher than the initial game stage (~90). In the very recent 5 periods (P44-P48), demand has averaged 86.6, suggesting a slight cooling or stabilization. Since we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final decision period (orders placed now arrive in Period 53, and the game ends at 50). However, per the objective of matching supply to demand up to the end of the horizon, I will use a recent_N=10 approach to capture the most relevant demand stability for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is confirmed as a steady 4 periods (as evidenced by P44 order arriving in P48). I will maintain L at default (4) which is consistent with historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower altitude recently: P39-P48 average is 93.5 compared to mid-game levels of ~104.

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing chips(Regular). The observed lead time is stable at 4 periods (P45 arrived in P49). Demand has shown a recent shift; while the mid-game average (P31-P44) was around 101.4, the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48) averaged 93.5, and the last 5 periods (P45-P49) averaged 98.6. This suggests demand has cooled from the P37-P42 peak but remains higher than the early-game average of ~90. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization at a slightly lower level than the mid-game peak, but higher than the start. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect current volatility (standard deviation of the last 10 periods is approximately 18.2). Note: The large in-transit balance (351) relative to on-hand (31) reflects orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49 still in the pipeline. Since L=4, the P46 order is expected to arrive next period (P50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level recently: P40-P49 average is 95.4, down from the P32-P42 average of 105.7 units.
