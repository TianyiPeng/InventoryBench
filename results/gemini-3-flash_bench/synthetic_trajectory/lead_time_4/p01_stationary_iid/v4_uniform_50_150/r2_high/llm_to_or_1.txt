Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) shows a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock levels immediately to cover demand for the review period plus lead time (1+L = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data points (5 samples) as a baseline. The profit margin is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), justifying a higher service level which the backend OR will compute based on these parameters.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (readable at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (95 in P1) cannot be met yet. The historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show variability with a mean of 93.8. Although P1 demand was 95 (close to mean), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline. The base stock calculation will naturally aim for a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). No changepoints or lead-time deviations are visible yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the shipments from Period 1 and 2 (totaling 296 units in-transit) haven't arrived yet. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we don't expect the Period 1 order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 95 and 71. The 5 historical samples provided (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show significant variance. Given the on-hand stock is 0 and we are early in the game, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to bridge the historical samples (avg ~94) and the early game observations (avg 83). I will maintain the default lead time of 4 until we have arrival data to adjust it. The backend will calculate base stock using the provided methods to cover the (L+1) period risk window.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, zero arrivals so far are expected and do not indicate lost shipments or lead time drift yet. However, the business is currently losing all potential sales (sold=0) because initial inventory was 0 and nothing has arrived. Demand has been fluctuating: 95, 71, 136, with an average of approximately 100.7 units/period. Period 4 demand (from history provided in prompt) was 58, and Period 5 was 129. I will use the mean of all available history (5 samples: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129; average = 93.8) to forecast. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat (default) will use (1+4) * 93.8 = 469. Pipeline inventory is currently 428 (from orders in P1, P2, P3). The OR backend will calculate a base stock and order the difference to ensure we begin meeting demand as soon as the first shipment arrives.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message ready at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced 100% stockouts for 4 periods because no inventory has arrived yet. This is consistent with a 4-period lead time. Total in-transit is 577 (the sum of orders from P1-P4). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (average \u2248 93.8, std \u2248 36). Since the first order hasn't arriving 'concluded' yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the average of all 5 available samples, and for sigma_hat, I'll use the standard deviation of all samples to capture the volatility (range 58 to 130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1029.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is now flowing (On-hand: 92). The in-transit pipeline (429 units) reflects orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 95, 71, 136, 59, 59 (mean \u2248 84). However, the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section provided in the prompt setup shows slightly different values: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (mean \u2248 93.8). I will rely more heavily on the game history samples for the recent trend, which shows a slight dip in the last two periods (59, 59). Given L=4, the backend needs parameters to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I'll use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full initial history and set L to default as the lead time is currently stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1283.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order P1 arrived in P5, Order P2 arrived in P6). Demand has been relatively stable but shows some fluctuation. Historical demand samples are [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] from the prompt and [95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76] from the conclude messages. The average demand across these 11 samples is approximately 87.7 units per period. Since L=4, the review+lead period covers 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the most recent demand trends while maintaining stability. The lead time L is confirmed as 4, so I will use 'default'. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (1+L) * mean(recent_N) remains responsive to the current demand level of ~80-90 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2587.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical data (P5-P7 concludes) confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (including provided pre-game samples) shows a stable regime without clear seasonal shifts yet: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129, 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144. The mean demand is approximately 92.5 units/period with a standard deviation of 33.7. Using L=4, the pipeline inventory (on-hand 149 + in-transit 229 = 378) must cover demand for the review period plus lead time (1+L = 5 periods). Current coverage (378 / 92.5) is ~4.08 periods, which is slightly below the 5-period target. Therefore, we should maintain base-stock levels using all available data (recent_N=12) to capture the variance and ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach the target service level. I will use 'calculate' for L as it matches the observed data, and 'recent_N' with N=12 to use all specific data points for demand mean and volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, we have 151 units on-hand and 228 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5-8). Historical demand shows a significant upward shift starting around Period 7: the first five samples (including pre-game data) averaged ~94, while the last four periods (P5-P8) average ~106.5, with the most recent two periods (P7-P8) hitting ~145. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or seasonality. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh these higher recent values more heavily, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent surge (avg ~106.5 per period) over the lead time + review period (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started Period 7: Average demand increased from ~85 (P1-P6) to ~145 (P7-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1366.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 7. Before Period 7 (P1-P6), mean demand was ~88. From Period 7 to Period 9, demand has been 144, 147, and 76. While P9 showed a dip (76), the previous two periods were significantly higher. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable but can fluctuate; however, the shift in mean necessitates a more responsive forecast. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand levels (Avg ~110 over P6-P9) while accounting for the recent variability. With L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 78 with 407 in transit (P6-P9 orders), which aligns with the lead time. Setting L to default (4), and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to adapt to the new regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P10). Demand history shows a recent shift: Periods 1-6 averaged ~84 units/period, while Periods 7-10 show high volatility (144, 147, 76, 71), averaging ~110. However, P7-P8 were significantly higher (~145) than P9-P10 (~73), suggesting the 'shift' noted in carry-over insights at Period 9 might have been a temporary spike or high variance rather than a sustained plateau. Given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the critical ratio q is 0.95, meaning the backend will target a high service level. To balance the recent low demand in P9-P10 with the previous spike, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering P6-P10: 76, 144, 147, 76, 71, avg=102.8) to capture the higher variance while normalizing the mean. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect this recent volatility. L remains default (4).

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 to P7 arrivals all reflect L=4). However, the demand regime shift previously identified at Period 9 (averaging ~145 in P7-P8) has not been sustained. Demand from P9-P11 was 76, 71, and 52 respectively, suggesting the initial 'shift' was a temporary fluctuation or the regime has shifted back toward a lower mean. Looking at the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the average demand is (144+147+76+71+52)/5 = 98. This is higher than the early period average (~82) but much lower than the peak. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this moderate demand level and current volatility while keeping L at the default promised/observed value of 4. With 32 on-hand and 574 in-transit, the pipeline is full, but the OR backend needs these parameters to manage the 'base stock' level effectively against future demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (P1-P8 orders have all arrived with L=4). Demand analysis shows a shift occurred around Period 7. While the carry-over insight noted an increase from ~85 to ~145, recent periods (P9-P12) have actually shown a cooling off, with demand values of 76, 71, 52, and 73 respectively. Looking at the last 6 periods (P7-P12), the mean demand is ~86.3, which is much closer to the initial regime than the spike seen in P7-P8. Given this volatility and the return to lower levels, I will use a recent_N of 6 for demand forecasting (mu) to capture this 'post-spike' stabilization. I will use the default calculation for lead time (L) as it matches the promised 4 periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 6 periods to reflect the current variability in this new phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in P7-P8 (avg 145) has subsided; P9-P12 demand averaged 68, returning to levels similar to the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $891.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a brief spike in periods 7-8. For the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 66.2 (76, 71, 52, 73, 59), which aligns with the initial demand levels (mean ~85 in P1-P6). Lead time is consistently behaving at the promised 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). In-transit inventory (331) is significant, representing orders from P10-P13. With current on-hand inventory at 230 and demand averaging ~66 per period, we are well-covered for the lead time (L=4) plus current period (total 5 periods of demand = 330 units). I am setting L to 'calculate' as it matches the observed data. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (P9-P13) while excluding the P7-P8 outlier spike. The OR backend will use our high critical ratio (~0.95) to maintain a safety stock against demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2093.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a return to standard levels after a temporary spike in Periods 7-8. Over the last six periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged approximately 76 units (76, 71, 52, 73, 59, 125). Although Period 14 saw a jump back to 125, the overall trend is significantly lower than the P7-P8 peak. With On-hand inventory at 282 and In-transit at 154 (total pipeline = 436), and a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we are currently well-stocked. The OR backend needs to calculate base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 captures this current regime (returning from spike) while allowing for the volatility observed in the most recent period. Current stock (436) vs. estimated 5-period demand (~380-450) suggests the backend will likely order minimally or nothing this period, which is appropriate given the high on-hand balance and holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following a spike in Periods 7-8 and a subsequent dip. Over the last seven periods (P9-P15), demand has averaged approximately 80 units (76, 71, 52, 73, 59, 125, 102). While P14 and P15 showed values above 100, the overall trend since P9 suggests a mean significantly lower than the P7-P8 spike but slightly higher than the immediate post-spike lull. I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while incorporating the recent moderate increases. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across multiple 'conclude' messages (P1 through P11 arrivals all showed lead_time=4), so L remains at the default promised value. On-hand inventory is currently high (247), but with a 4-period lead time, parameters must account for demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1066.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following a spike in Periods 7-8 and a subsequent dip. Over the last four periods (P13-P16), the average demand is approximately 88.5, which is slightly higher than the average observed in the P9-P12 window (68). Lead times remain consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-12. Currently, there is a high on-hand inventory (226) and a significant amount in-transit (199), primarily from orders placed in P13 (40), P15 (39), and P16 (120). Anticipating a lead time of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the current total stock (on-hand + in-transit = 425), and an estimated demand of ~90 per period, we are currently well-covered. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike demand regime (P9-P16) while smoothing out localized fluctuations (e.g., P14 spike). Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last several periods. Following a high-demand spike in P7-P8 (~145), demand from P9 to P17 has averaged approximately 83 units (ranges from 52 to 125). Looking at the more recent 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 95.2 units, which aligns well with the initial behavior of the product. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through P13's arrival in P17). I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike regime (P9-P17) which represents the current 'normal' behavior. This range is long enough to provide a stable mean while excluding the anomalous spike. With a lead time of 4, the target inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). Current on-hand (144) + in-transit (214) is 358 units. The backend will adjust ordering based on these parameters to maintain the service level required by the high profit margin vs. low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime (P9-P17) stabilized at an average of ~83 units per period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P9-P18) has stabilized following a brief outlier peak in P7-P8. The average demand since P9 is approximately 85.0 units with a standard deviation of about 26.5. In Period 18, zero units arrived despite an order being placed in Period 14 (lead time 4), but the history shows P14's order was actually 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' message. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). I will use a window of the last 10 periods (P9-P18) to represent the current stable demand regime (N=10). This provides a representative mean (mu) and variance (sigma) for the OR backend while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is low (43), and though 342 units are in-transit, the backend needs accurate regime statistics to maintain service levels for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1058.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 25 units, which is quite low relative to recent demand. We have 431 units in-transit. Crucially, the order from Period 14 (ordered 0 units) essentially caused an arrival gap in Period 18, and although some stock arrived in Period 19, the inventory position remains tight. Demand has stabilized into a post-spike regime since Period 9; the average demand from Period 9 to 19 is approximately 85.0 units with a standard deviation of 26.6. I will use N=11 (P9-P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable post-spike regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P17 and P19). Providing parameters that reflect this stabilized demand and reliable lead time will help the OR backend maintain a service level that maximizes profit while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory reached 0 with 3 lost sales, indicating current supply is barely meeting demand. Examining the lead time: Period 14's order (0 units) should have arrived in P18, and Period 15's order arrived in P19 (LT=4), Period 16's order arrived in P20 (LT=4). Current in-transit includes orders from P17 (55), P18 (128), P19 (128), and P20 (51), totaling 362 units. P17's arrival (55 units) is expected during P21. Since P18, the demand regime has shifted slightly higher or more volatile (101, 57, 148). The average demand from P9 to P20 is ~88.5 units. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean to capture this post-spike stability, while using a slightly wider sigma (recent_N=12) to account for the recent volatility (148 in P20). L remains at the stable 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P20 (148 units), resulting in stockout; average demand since P9 has stabilized around 88-90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the inventory hit 0 units while demand was 65, leading to lost sales. This followed a stockout in Period 20. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 447 units in-transit. A critical observation from history is that the order from Period 14 (likely requested based on the high demand in P7-P8) never arrived or 'concluded', confirming a lost shipment. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the stable actual lead time for other orders (as seen with P15, P16, and P17 arrivals). Demand since Period 9 has stabilized around a mean of 89.4 units per period (N=13), though volatility has increased recently. To recover from the stockouts and account for the lost shipment in the pipeline, I will set L=4, mu_hat based on the stable regime since P9 (N=13), and sigma_hat based on the same period to capture the recent increase in variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment: Order from Period 14 (placed after Period 13 conclude) never arrived (expected P18). Demand regime since P9 is stable at ~89 units/period but with increased variance in P20-P21.

Specifically, the last 4 periods (P19-P22) have shown a demand increase (avg ~95), including a stockout at P21. We confirmed a lost shipment from Period 14 in the previous turn. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods for all non-lost orders. Currently, we have 16 units on-hand and 415 in-transit (orders from P19-P22). To set OR parameters, I am using L=4 (promised). For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 (P9-P22) to capture the post-spike stabilized regime while smoothing out recent volatility. This covers the (L+1) horizon. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=14 to ensure the backend uses the standard deviation from this same stabilized period, which captures the recent increase in variance (e.g., P20 at 148, P22 at 112) without being overly swayed by the P7-P8 outlier spike.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P9-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 88 units. Period 23 saw a lower demand of 53, but the preceding periods (P20-P22) were high (148, 65, 112). I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized but slightly more volatile regime since Period 9. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P22 and P23). The shipment from P14 is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is 91 with a large pipeline (407 units), meaning the system is well-stocked for the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will continue using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in recent blocks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1698.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P22-P24: 112, 53, 92) averages 85.6 units, aligning with the long-term stable regime of ~85-90 units identified since P9. There was a significant volatility spike in P20-P21, but demand has since normalized. A confirmed lost shipment occurred for the P14 order (expected P18), which caused subsequent stockouts in P20-P21. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods for all orders that actually arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 50. Total in-transit is 398 units (representing orders from P21, P22, P23, and P24). To calculate parameters, I'm focusing on the post-spike stability period (P9-P24). For L, I use 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=16) to capture the stable demand regime from P9 onwards, which effectively covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N (N=16) to account for the increased variance seen in P20 without overreacting to the single lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at ~88 units (P9-P24 average is 88.5) despite variance spikes in P20-P21; standard lead time of 4 periods is consistent for all successful arrivals.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 9. Over the last 17 periods (P9-P25), the average demand is approximately 88.5 units. While there were spikes in P20 (148) and P22 (112) leading to stockouts, recent demand in P23-P25 (53, 92, 63) suggests a return to the mean. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P21 order arrived P25), with the exception of the lost shipment from P14. Currently, on-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 348. Total pipeline plus on-hand is 475. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average of 88.5, this is 442.5 units. Our current inventory position (475) is slightly above this mark, which is appropriate given the recent volatility. I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the demand regime since Period 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as the promised lead time of 4 is the most reliable observation.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P9-P26) has stabilized at an average of 88.3 units per period. While there were historical spikes (P7-P8) and localized volatility (P20), the demand over the last 18 periods is remarkably consistent. The promised lead time L=4 remains the observed standard, with the exception of the confirmed lost order from P14. Current on-hand inventory is 133, and in-transit is 307. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 88.3 = 441.5 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 440, which is perfectly aligned with the long-term stable mean. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 to capture this post-spike stability and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the slightly higher variance observed more recently (P20-P26) to maintain an appropriate service level for this high-margin (95% critical ratio) product.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~89 units per period since Period 9 (P9-P27 average = 88.6). Although individual periods show variance (e.g., P20 at 148, P27 at 119), the overall regime remains remarkably consistent. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1-P13, P15-P23) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods, with the notable exception of a lost shipment from P14. Currently, there are 134 units on-hand and 294 units in-transit (P24, P25, P26, P27 orders). The OR backend's inventory position calculation (on-hand + in-transit) will be 428. With lead time L=4, the system targets a base stock covering 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=19, covering the stable regime since P9) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend captures the recent stability and variance. Using L=default reflects the established 4-period arrival pattern.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 9. Over the last 20 periods (P9-P28), the average demand is 88.5 units per period. While there have been occasional spikes (e.g., P20 at 148, P27 at 119) and dips, there is no evidence of a new trend. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment from Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 117 units, and the pipeline is 363 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this stable post-spike regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time to use the historical average of successful arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the localized spike around Period 20-21. Since Period 22, demand has averaged 88.8 units per period (88.8 * 5 = 444 for review+lead time of 4). Recent demand (P25-P29) is slightly higher at 90.0 units, but consistent with the overall stable average of ~89 observed since Period 9. One order from Period 14 is confirmed lost, but subsequent orders (P15-P25) have arrived consistently with a lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units, and there are 325 units in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand post-volatility (P22-P29), as this period reflects the current mean and variance accurately. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent for all successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2282.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P30) shows an average of 113.5 units per period, which is higher than the long-term stable average of ~89 observed from P9-P24. This suggests a potential recent upward shift or increased volatility period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of P26's order arriving in P30. No new shipments appear lost since Period 14. To account for the recent demand increase (N=6: P25-P30), I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to elevate the base stock in response to higher recent sales levels (averaging ~114 vs ~89). L remains 'default' as 4 periods are consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely at P25: average demand increased from ~89 to ~114 (+28%) over the last 6 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Analyzing Period 25 to Period 31 (7 samples), the average demand is 111.1 units per period (63, 90, 119, 59, 124, 121, 111), which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~89. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the associated volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P22-P27 all showing lead_time=4. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 13, In-transit: 444) are being monitored; the high in-transit reflects the recent orders placed to match the higher demand regime. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised 4 periods, which aligns with observed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2056.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the average demand is approximately 110.8 units per period (63, 90, 119, 59, 124, 121, 111, 109). This is a significant increase from the previous stable average of ~88. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders arrived in P31 and P32 respectively). The OR backend calculation for mu_hat uses (1+L) * mean, so with L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over 5 periods. I am using recent_N with N=8 to capture this new elevated regime while smoothing out variance. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent volatility levels. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 469 units, which includes orders from P29-P32 (52, 136, 145, 136 = 469), and the on-hand inventory is 15. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain the target base stock level for the current demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1273.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P33) has shifted to an average of approximately 108 units per period, up from the previous average of ~89. The most recent demand values are 121, 111, 109, and 89. Period 33 resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 67 out of 89 demand) due to the delayed effect of lower orders in P29. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P29 order arriving in P33. To address the current stockout and the elevated demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=9 (covering the start of the regime shift at P25) to capture the higher mean. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the increased volatility observed in this period. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1) and subtract the high in-transit inventory (527 units), though the internal cap will ensure orders remain reasonable.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 25: Average demand increased from ~89 to ~108 (approx +21%) based on data from P25 to P33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25. From P25 to P34, the average demand is 100.5 units (63, 90, 119, 59, 124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79). This reflects an approximately 13-14% increase from the previous long-term average of ~88-89. Although the last two periods (P33, P34) showed lower demand (89, 79), the overall trend since P25 remains higher and relatively volatile. I am setting N=10 for mu_hat (covering the regime since P25) to capture this higher mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (57) following a stockout in P33, but a large pipeline (447 units) is in transit, including orders placed in P31-P34 which should begin arriving soon (P35 arrival will be the P31 order of 145 units). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=10 to account for higher recent volatility (std dev since P25 is approx 22).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Analyzing recent demand from Period 25 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 106.45 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 20.3. Currently, there are 96 units on-hand and 369 in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (the length of the current regime P25-P35) allows the OR backend to capture this specific seasonal/regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (except for one confirmed lost shipment in the past), so 'default' (promised lead time) is appropriate. The backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods (approx 532 units) and order enough to bridge the gap between that target and the pipeline inventory.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 109 units per period (samples: 63, 90, 119, 59, 124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79, 106, 142). This confirms the carry-over insight from P34. Inventory management is currently stable with 90 units on-hand and 339 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite the historical loss in Period 14. To maintain high service levels (critical given the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) while accounting for the recent regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this higher-demand period accurately. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is confirmed to be higher, with an average of approximately 104.5 units per period (P25-P37) compared to the previous ~89. Recent volatility is noted (P36 demand: 142, P37 demand: 67). Lead time is consistently 4 periods for all successful arrivals. I'm choosing recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at P25) to capture this higher mean and the observed variance. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumer behavior while accounting for recent fluctuations. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 25. Analyzing demand from Period 25 to Period 38 (14 samples), the average demand is approximately 100.2 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show an average of 101.6, while the previous 5 (P29-P33) showed 110.8, showing some stabilization. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=14 to capture this entire higher-demand regime accurately. Standard lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, with no further missing shipments since the Period 14 loss. On-hand inventory is 75 units, and in-transit is substantial (399), but given the 4-period lead time and the current demand level, the OR backend needs to maintain a high service level due to the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of ~95%.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since P25 at an average of ~100 units/period (P25-P38 mean: 100.2), representing a persistent increase from the pre-P25 average (~89).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25 at an average of approximately 100 units per period (the average from P25 to P39 is 100.2 units). In the most recent periods (P34-P39), demand has shown some volatility (79, 106, 142, 67, 114, 75). Currently, on-hand inventory is 67 units with 449 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the demand regime shifted at P25 and has remained relatively stable at the new level for 15 periods, I will use N=15 for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior. This N is large enough to smooth out recent variability while adhering to the regime shift identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized at an average of approximately 100 units/period (P25-P40 mean: 101.4). Recent demand in P40 was 131 units, slightly above this average but consistent with the volatility observed in this regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (42 units), but there is a significant in-transit pipeline (410 units). Since lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand mean and variance from Period 25 onwards (N=16). This ensures the OR backend uses the +100 units/period baseline while accounting for the recent variance, balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a sufficient service level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized at an average of approximately 100 units/period (P25-P41 mean: 99.8). The most recent demand sample in P41 (64) is lower than average but consistent with the volatility seen in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 121 units, and there are 410 units in transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). To maintain the target service level given the higher demand regime and its variance, I will use recent_N (N=17, covering P25-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time L is set to default (4 periods).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from P25 to P42 (the last 18 periods), the mean is approximately 101.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.6. While recent demand in P41 and P42 has been lower (64 and 51), this follows a high demand period (131 in P40), suggesting typical volatility rather than a new downward shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 153 and 383 units in-transit, the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach with N=18 to capture the stabilized regime since P25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P25-P43 mean is 100.1). Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged 83.2, showing some fluctuation but no definitive regime shift downwards yet. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals (P39 order arrived P43). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (matching the start of the current regime at P25) to capture the higher mean and variance observed since that shift. This allows the OR backend to maintain a safety stock appropriate for the current 100-unit average while respecting the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P25-P44) has stabilized with an average of approximately 100 units per period (current P25-P44 average is 100.35). The last 10 periods (P35-P44) show a slightly lower mean of 93.9, but given the volatility and the goal of maximizing profit (95% service level environment: $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), it is safer to maintain the forecast at the higher regime level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P40-P44); although P14 was lost, no further losses have occurred in the last 20 periods. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture the stable regime starting at P25. The on-hand inventory is 148 and pipeline inventory is 334. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the current total inventory (482) is sufficient to cover demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2169.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 25. Analyzing the data from P25 to P45, the average demand is 98.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 25.3. Recent demand (P39-P45) averages 93.3 units, confirming that the earlier estimate of ~100 units/period is still valid. The current on-hand inventory is 168 units, with 282 units in-transit. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (as evidenced by the arrivals from P37-P41), despite an earlier lost shipment in Period 14. To manage the current regime (mean ~100) and its volatility (sigma ~25), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=21 (covering the period since the regime shift at P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the appropriate service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) based on current stabilized data while being protected against recent variance (e.g., P45 demand of 123).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period (P25-P46 mean: 98.6). Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a similar mean of 95.8, suggesting no significant recent shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain the base stock level around the stabilized mean of ~100. I am using recent_N (N=22, covering the stable regime since P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while ensuring the backend accounts for the 4-period lead time. With 160 units on-hand and 356 in-transit (total pipeline of 516), and considering the end of the game (P50), current stock levels are sufficient to cover expected demand (~400 units total remaining) without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Due to the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to manage existing inventory and in-transit stock to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Since new orders cannot arrive in time, I will set 'mu_hat' to zero to prevent the OR engine from placing unnecessary new orders, while relying on the current 'On-hand' (152) and 'In-transit' (371) to cover the endgame demand. Historical demand since the last regime shift (P25-P47) has averaged approximately 93.6 units per period with a standard deviation of 27.8. Pipeline inventory (which arrives during P48, P49, and P50) is more than sufficient to cover anticipated demand, even if it spikes. Setting L to default (4) and sigma to default ensures the backend calculates parameters based on standard logic, but the zeroed mu_hat acts as a floor to prevent waste.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1896.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the penultimate period of the simulation. The primary objective shifts from long-term inventory balancing to minimizing ending inventory for the final period (Period 50) while meeting demand. The demand regime starting around Period 25 has stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (P25-P48 average is 99.4). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory state: On-hand is 137, and In-transit is 279 (orders from P45, P46, P47 totaling 91+130+58=279). Note that the order from P45 (91 units) is expected to arrive during Period 49. The order from P46 (130 units) will arrive during Period 50. Therefore, by the end of Period 50, we will have received 221 additional units. Given the current on-hand of 137 and expected demand of ~200 units over the next two periods, the existing inventory plus incoming shipments (137 + 221 = 358) is more than sufficient to cover demand. Further ordering (P49 or P50) would only increase holding costs unnecessarily for the terminal state. I am setting L to default (4) and providing explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values based on the stable P25-P48 regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the current status, but the pipeline inventory will naturally suppress any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1592.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 97 units per period (P25-P49 average: 97.4, P40-P49 average: 87.1). Recent demand has trended slightly lower than the P25-P39 mean of 100, but has remained volatile. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment back in P14. Currently, we have 137 units on-hand and 329 in-transit (orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I will use a recent window of N=25 (from P25 onwards) to capture the current regime characteristics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the sustained higher volume since P25 compared to the early game, while balancing the moderate holding cost against the high profit margin (Critical Ratio = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized at a mean of ~97 units/period (observed average from P25 to P49 is 97.4).
