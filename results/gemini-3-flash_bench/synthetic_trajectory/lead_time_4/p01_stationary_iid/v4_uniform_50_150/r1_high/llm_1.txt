Historical demand over the last 5 periods was 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129 (Average: 93.8, Volatility is high). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for demand in Period 5, but I won't see the arrival confirmation until Period 6. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am guaranteed to have stockouts for Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. My goal is to cover demand for the arrival period (P5) and the subsequent period (P6) because the next possible order (placed in P2) wouldn't arrive until P6. Given the average demand of ~94 and a high recent spike (129), I will forecast a need for roughly 100-110 units per period. To cover the pipeline for the lead time (4) + 1 period, I target an inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of approximately 500 units. I will place an initial order of 500 to build the pipeline immediately.",

Recent performance (Periods 35-43) confirms this, averaging 118 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P37, P38, P39). Currently, in Period 44, on-hand inventory is 48 units. The in-transit pipeline (475 units) consists of orders from P40 (110 units - expected to arrive this period), P41 (133), P42 (117), and P43 (115). Since we are at Period 44 of 50, and lead time is 4, an order placed now (P44) will arrive in P48. Orders placed in P45 will arrive in P49, and P46 will arrive in P50. Total demand to cover through the end of the game (P44-P50) is approximately 118 * 7 = 826 units. Total supply available (On-hand 48 + In-transit 475) is 523 units. Required units to order over the next few periods is 303 units. I will order 120 units this period to maintain a consistent flow and avoid stockouts in the final periods.",

Orders placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49 and be available for demand in Period 49 (resolution happens after decision). Orders placed in P46 will arrive in P50. Any order placed after P46 will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, we should only cover demand for the remaining periods where inventory can actually reach the machine. \n\n1. Demand Analysis: The long-term average demand is approximately 115-120 units. Recent demand (P40-P44) has been slightly lower (avg ~106), including a significant drop in P44 (56). I will stick to a forecast of ~115 units per period.\n2. Pipeline & Inventory: On-hand is 102. In-transit consists of orders from P41 (133), P42 (117), P43 (115), and P44 (120), totaling 485. \n   - P45 Arrival: P41 order (133). Available for P45 demand.\n   - P46 Arrival: P42 order (117). Available for P46 demand.\n   - P47 Arrival: P43 order (115). Available for P47 demand.\n   - P48 Arrival: P44 order (120). Available for P48 demand.\n   - P49 Arrival: P45 order (This decision).\n   - P50 Arrival: P46 order.\n3. Calculation for P49 & P50: Total demand remaining (P45-P50) is 6 periods * 115 = 690 units. Total stock available or in-transit = 102 (on-hand) + 485 (in-transit) = 587 units. \nRequired to cover until end of P50 = 690 - 587 = 103 units. \nHowever, since P46 is the last useful ordering period, I will split the remaining needed stock. Ordering ~100 units now ensures that even if demand spikes in the final periods, we avoid stockouts in P49, while avoiding excessive holding costs for units that might not sell by P50.",

This existing pipeline is sufficient to cover the expected demand through Period 50. Ordering extra now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for ending inventory in Period 50.

The product is 'chips(Regular)', which has a stable demand regime averaging approximately 115-120 units/period (recent average P41-P46 is ~100, but long-term is higher). A 4-period lead time means any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is after the game ends. Therefore, any order placed in Period 47, 48, 49, or 50 will incur holding costs if the game continues or will simply be wasted/unnecessary as they arrive post-game.

In-transit inventory consists of orders from P43 (115 units), P44 (120 units), and P45 (100 units), scheduled to arrive in P47, P48, and P49 respectively.
