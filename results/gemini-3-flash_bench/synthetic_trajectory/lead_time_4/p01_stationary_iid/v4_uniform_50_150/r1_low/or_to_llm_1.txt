Inventory & Pipeline Analysis: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 309 units in transit (151 from P1, 158 from P2). Demand is being lost because we started with 0 inventory and the lead time is long. Cumulative demand in P1 and P2 was 263 units.\n3.

The mean demand is approximately 110-120 units.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 160 units is calculated using a base-stock policy. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for Period 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 + current period). The pipeline (309) plus the OR recommendation (160) totals 469 units.

My current pipeline (469 units) + the OR recommendation (38) = 507 units. Total expected demand over 5 periods (P4-P8) is roughly 500-550 units based on historical averages.

The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the large pipeline (520) relative to on-hand inventory, but it fails to account for the stabilized higher demand.

However, there is a clear lost shipment: the order from Period 12 (ordered 0 units) means nothing was expected, but the order from Period 11 arrived in Period 15, and the order from Period 13 arrived in Period 17, meaning Period 16 had 0 arrivals despite an order being placed in Period 12 (which was 0). Wait, reconsidering history: P12 order was 0. P16 arrival was 0 (from P12). This is consistent. No orders are lost.\n\n2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory consists of orders from Periods 23 (146), 24 (152), 25 (100), and 26 (65), totaling 463 units. \n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~110 units. The 'Carry-over insights' note a regime of ~129 units. Using the higher estimate (129) for a 5-period window (L+1) requires a base stock of ~645 units to cover demand until the order placed now arrives.\n\n4. **Strategy**: Total inventory needed = 645. Current pipeline = 463. Gap = 182 units. The OR recommendation of 88 is suppressed by its cap and its use of older, lower-demand data (averaging in the very low initial periods). To avoid continued stockouts (we have had 0 on-hand at the end of the last two periods), I must increase the order to bridge the gap between current pipeline and the (L+1) demand coverage.",

To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at 120 units/period, we need ~600 units. 5. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 65 is too low because it uses older, lower demand samples in its distribution. To reach a sustainable stock level and recover from the stockouts in P25-P26, I need to maintain a higher order volume. Since the pipeline is currently 430 and on-hand is 57 (Total 487), and I want to cover 5 periods of demand (~120 * 5 = 600), an order around 113-120 is appropriate.

Pipeline (In-transit) is 393 units, consisting of orders from P41 (59), P42 (90), P43 (131), and P44 (113). The P41 order (59 units) is expected to arrive this period (P45), bringing potential stock to 167 for demand resolution. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P40-P44) has been 139, 92, 129, 113, 56 (avg 105.8). Long-term average since P5 is ~109. The game is nearing its end (Period 45 of 50). \n4. **Constraint & Strategy**: Total inventory + pipeline = 501 units. With 6 periods remaining (45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50), and an average demand of ~110, we require ~660 units to cover the rest of the game. However, an order placed today (P45) arrives in P49. Only orders placed in P45 and P46 will arrive before the game ends (P49 and P50 respectively). Current inventory and pipeline cover roughly 4.6 periods of demand. \n5. **OR Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 51 is slightly conservative but reasonable given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1) and the proximity to the end of the game. I will follow the OR baseline of 51 to maintain a lean inventory and minimize end-of-game holding cost risk while ensuring coverage for the final periods.",
