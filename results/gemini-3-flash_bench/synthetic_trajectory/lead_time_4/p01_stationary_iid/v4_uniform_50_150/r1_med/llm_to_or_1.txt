Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand samples (Period 1-5) are provided: [130, 88, 64, 58, 129], averaging 93.8 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no actual lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), the OR engine needs to cover the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the average reflecting the provided historical context (93.8 * 5 = 469). For sigma_hat (volatility), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the variation seen in the sample (standard deviation ~35.6, scaled by sqrt(5) ~79.6). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock level that accounts for both the expected lead time and the recent volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are now in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect these to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales of 134 units in Period 1. Since we only have one demand observation (134) and no lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize available historical data (the samples provided in the prompt: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129). The mean of these samples is 93.8. With L=4, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*93.8 = 469. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 and 2 was 134 and 129 units (averaging 131.5), which is higher than the provided sample list (avg 93.8). We have 0 on-hand inventory because nothing has arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) will arrive during Period 5 and be visible/usable in Period 6. Currently, 309 units are in-transit (151 from P1 + 158 from P2). Since the actual lead time hasn't been confirmed yet (no 'conclude' message with arrival), I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the higher observed demand (P1: 134, P2: 129) compared to the sample seed, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be first visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not indicate a lead time shift or lost orders yet. In-transit inventory stands at 447 units (151 from P1, 158 from P2, 138 from P3). Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including the provided seed data) shows some volatility: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129. The most recent demand (P1-P3 conclude) recorded as 134, 129, 79. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand to capture the recent mean, and 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence to override it yet. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (151 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold have been 0 because no stock has arrived yet. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows samples: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (average ~94). However, the 'Period conclude' demand signals are: 134, 129, 79, 105 (average ~112). Since total demand across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5) must be covered, I will use all available samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. No lead time confirmation is possible yet as the first order has not concluded its journey (P1 order arrives P1+4=P5). I will use the default promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 134, 129, 79, 105, and 139 (Mean: 117.2, Std: ~25). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived in the Period 5 conclude message, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (12 units) because the initial orders were delayed by the lead time, causing stockouts in early periods. However, we have a significant pipeline (In-transit: 444 units from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 4), which is expected to arrive starting next period (Period 6 arrival resolution). Because the lead time is confirmed at 4, the OR backend needs to cover a window of L+1 = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the available demand history while the system stabilizes from the initial lead-time gap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. From historical data, we have confirmed that the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived at P5, P2 arrived at P6). This matches the promised lead time. Demand history for periods 1-6 shows a mean of approximately 113.8 units per period (134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96). There is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, as the demand fluctuates around this average. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the full recent history after the initial startup. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 74, and in-transit is 445 (representing orders from P3, P4, P6). The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate the base stock and place the order for P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $458.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Period 4's order (148 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 8 arrival phase (viewable in Period 9's start). Historical demand samples are 130, 88, 64, 58, 129, 134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96, 134. Looking at the last 5 samples (105, 139, 96, 134 plus the initial data), there's a slight uptick in recent mean demand compared to the very early periods. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current demand trend (approx 120/period). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (5 * avg_demand) = approx 600 units. Current pipeline (In-transit) is 402, and On-hand is 78. Total inventory view is 480. Setting mu_hat to recent_N=5 will adjust the target slightly upwards to maintain the service level.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a consistent historical lead time of 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 8. Total in-transit inventory is 375 (orders from P6: 159, P7: 95, P8: 121), which aligns with expectations. On-hand inventory is 101. Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded samples: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (pre-game) and 134, 129, 79, 105, 139, 96, 134, 125 (post-game). The most recent 8 periods show a mean demand of approximately 117.6 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods). Using the 'recent_N' method for N=8 captures the current demand regime well. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 9 (demand 147 vs 101 available). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (P5 through P8) confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order placed in Period 5 (which was 0 units) explains the 'arrived=0' in the Period 9 conclude message. We expect the order from Period 6 (159 units) to arrive during Period 10. The demand history (P1-P9) shows an average demand of approximately 115 units per period with a standard deviation around 26. Since the inventory is currently 0 and we have a pipeline of 528 units, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the full recent demand distribution. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the data consistently shows 4 periods, matching the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime appears stable with mean ~115 and std ~26. Inventory stockout occurred in P9 due to zero order in P5 failing to replenish the pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4. The order history reveals that the order placed in Period 5 was 0, which resulted in a stockout in Period 9 because no replenishment arrived. We have since recovered, with the Period 6 order (159 units) arriving in Period 10, leaving us with 67 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is currently 488 units, representing orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10. Demand remains stable. Averaging the demand from Period 1 to Period 10, the mean is 118, and the standard deviation is approximately 24. Since the lead time is consistent at 4 periods, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent stable regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the observed volatility across the same period.

Specifically, P8's order (121 units) is expected to arrive this period (P12), followed by P9's order (153 units) in P13. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a mean of 116.5 and a standard deviation of 22.8. There was a stockout in P9 because no order was placed in P5, creating a pipeline gap. However, the current In-transit volume (472) plus On-hand (61) equals 533 units, which comfortably covers the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods), as 5 * 116.5 = 582.5. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods and use the full historical demand data (N=11) to stabilize the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, as the regime appears steady after the initial noise.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by the arrival history (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P8 all arrived with a lead time of 4). The order from P5 was 0, explaining the stockout in P9. Currently, on-hand inventory is 35, and the in-transit pipeline (443 units) covers expected arrivals for P13 (P9 order), P14 (P10 order), P15 (P11 order), and P16 (P12 order). Demand remains stable since the initial variation; the last 12 periods show a mean of ~119. To optimize for the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Critcal Ratio = 0.8), I will use the recent history (N=12) to capture current demand levels (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), while keeping Lead Time at the confirmed default of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 13 shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 112.5 and a standard deviation of 22.1. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 13 where the P9 order arrived after exactly 4 periods). We currently have 82 units on hand and 448 units in transit. The pipeline is robust because orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13 are yet to arrive. Using N=8 for demand statistics (Period 6-13) covers the most recent stable regime effectively. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers demand across the review and lead time (L+1=5 periods), balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6-13 confirmed stable: mean ~112, std ~22. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $494.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 15. Based on historical data from Period 6 to Period 14, the demand regime is stable with a mean of approximately 117 units per period (calculation: [96+134+125+147+92+101+147+106+139]/9 \u2248 120.7; previously estimated around 112-115). Standard deviation is around 22-26 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Note that Period 9's arrival (from P5) was 0 because 0 units were ordered in P5. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 435 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is 62 units. Since the target base stock for (L+1)=5 periods at a mean of ~115 is 575 plus safety stock, the current total position (62 + 435 = 497) is slightly below the target. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this stable regime specifically since the stockout events and lead-time confirmation starting from P6.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a stable regime. Over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the mean demand is 111.4 units with a standard deviation of 26.17. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P8 and P10-P15). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this stable window. This ensures our base stock level (for L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current demand pattern while the OR backend's inventory balancing logic accounts for the 505 units in-transit. The on-hand inventory of 68 plus arrivals from P12 (121 units), P13 (158 units), P14 (106 units), and P15 (149 units) expected over the next 4 periods should satisfy the demand forecast of approx 557 units over the 5-period horizon.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 6. Analyzing demand from Period 6 to Period 16, the mean demand is approximately 111.5 units and the standard deviation is approximately 25.4. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 16 (excluding the zero-order from Period 5 which caused the stockout in P9). Since we are in Period 17, our order must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (the length of the current stable regime starting from Period 6) to capture the most accurate current demand characteristics. This will set the base stock level to satisfy approximately 5 periods of demand while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.8).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime. Since Period 6, the demand mean has consistently hovered around 112 units per period. Current lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P5 to P17. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 12 periods (P6 to P17) to encompass the current stable regime and filter out the initial start-up noise and the P5 zero-order disruption. The pipeline (in-transit) is currently 396 units, comprising orders from P14 (106), P15 (149), P16 (56), and P17 (85). With an on-hand inventory of 97 and a lead time of 4, the system is well-covered for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand is 97.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6 (elevated by a low of 54 in P18). Looking at the longer history from P6-P18, the average is ~107.4. All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (149) plus in-transit (419) totals 568 units, which covers roughly 5.3 periods of average demand (~107), aligning well with the (L+1) requirement of 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (P6 to P18) to capture the stable behavior since the initial volatility, while using 'calculate' for L to leverage the consistent 4-period lead time observed in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand and lead-time environment. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the P15 order in P19). Demand from Period 6 to Period 19 has an average of approximately 110 units per period (1543 total units over 14 periods) with relatively low volatility. Current 'On-hand' inventory is 156 units, and 'In-transit' is 309, totaling 465 units of pipeline inventory. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent average of 110/period, 5 periods require ~550 units. Therefore, the system is slightly under-stocked relative to demand but well-positioned to avoid immediate stockouts. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to leverage the stable historical lead-time data and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (the length of the stable regime identified since Period 6) to capture the current demand distribution accurately without influence from the early startup phase.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (P5 through P20). The demand regime remains relatively stable. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P6-P20), the mean demand is approximately 106.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 30.6. There are no missing shipments; all orders from P1 to P16 have arrived correctly. Current on-hand inventory is 159, and in-transit inventory is 406 (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Following the OR backend logic, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this stable regime for both demand mean and volatility, and use 'calculate' for lead time since the historical lead time data is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a stable regime. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P7-P21), the mean demand is approximately 106 with a standard deviation of 30. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent, as evidenced by the arrivals from Periods 13 through 17 all concluding with a 4-period lead time. Current on-hand inventory is 142, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 360, bringing the total position to 502 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). At a mean of 106, 5 periods of demand equals 530 units. The current position of 502 is slightly below this, and significantly below the base stock level considering a safety factor for the 80% service level target (based on profit $4 vs holding cost $1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet slightly more volatile recent demand pattern while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been perfectly stable.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 110-115 units since Period 6. Recent demand (last 8 periods) shows a mean of approximately 99 units with a standard deviation of 40, indicating some increased volatility but no major regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P22, P21, P20, etc.). I will continue to use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I'll use the last 15 samples (N=15) to capture the stable post-startup regime while allowing for recent variability. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same N=15 to capture the standard deviation of this stable regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand while managing the trade-off between the high profit margin and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $527.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), with a mean of 116.4 compared to the previous stable regime. Recent demand values are 142, 53, 102, 147, and 138. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P23 of the P19 order. Total pipeline inventory is 449 units (orders from P20, P21, P22, P23), and on-hand is 25. To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current elevated levels, and considering the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) suggests a high service level (~80%), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean shift accurately. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand and safety stock while subtracting the healthy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased since Period 19; mean remains ~110-115 but with wider swings (53 to 147). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues into Period 25 with a stable mean but noticeably higher variance starting from Period 19. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 110.16 units, consistent with the long-term average, but the standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the P6-P13 window. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the current period is 25 and we see 'Period 24 conclude', we are making a decision for Period 25. The on-hand inventory is 99 units, and in-transit is 478 units. Based on L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~110, we expect to need ~550 units in the pipeline. Current total (on-hand + in-transit) is 577 units, which is slightly above the mean but appropriate given the recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 to capture the stable mean while acknowledging the full regime since the first major analysis point, and 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to overweight the recent increase in demand swings.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 19-25) has shown increased volatility with values ranging from 53 to 147, but the mean remains centered around 110-115. We are currently in Period 26. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed by the historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P25 shows arrival of P21 order, L=4). Pipeline inventory is high (492 units in-transit), but on-hand inventory is low (5 units). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). To account for the recently increased volatility noted in the Period 24 carry-over insight, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering the shift starting around Period 19) to capture the current demand mean and standard deviation. This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects both the stable mean and the higher recent variance to maintain the service level across the lead time plus current review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 26. Historical demand from Period 19 to 26 shows a mean of 115.3 and a standard deviation of 33.2, indicating increased volatility compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 527 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26) and current on-hand at 0, the next arrival is expected in P27 (order from P23, size 153). I will use recent_N with N=8 (the stable regime since P19) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this higher volatility and protect against future stockouts while minimizing holding costs. The OR backend will compute the order based on a base-stock level that covers lead time + review period (5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a regime change in volatility since Period 19, with the mean remaining relatively stable around 110-115, but with significant swings (observed mean of 115 and standard deviation of 30 over the last 9 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as verified by recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 27's arrival from Period 23). Due to a recent minor stockout in Period 26 and increasing volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the current high-volatility regime (starting from Period 19). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the stable mean and the higher variance to maintain service levels in the face of wider demand swings. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high since Period 19; mean ~112, but standard deviation has increased to ~30 (compared to ~22 previously). Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand level remains relatively stable around a mean of ~112 units per period, but volatility has significantly increased since Period 19. The standard deviation for the last 10 periods (P19-P28) is approximately 32, compared to ~22 in earlier stable regimes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory position (on-hand 124 + in-transit 402 = 526) must cover lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). At a mean of 112, expected demand over 5 periods is 560 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to ensure the backend uses the higher recent volatility for safety stock calculation. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has shown increased volatility with a mean of approximately 113 and a higher standard deviation of about 30. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the continuous arrival of orders from P21 through P25. Current on-hand inventory is 47, and pipeline inventory is 446 (orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29). To ensure the OR engine captures the recent volatility increase while maintaining a stable mean, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the period since the volatility shift at P19). This allows the base stock calculation to account for the wider demand swings (53 to 147) and maintain the desired service level (q = 4/5 = 0.8) without being overly influenced by the lower volatility data prior to Period 19.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility starting around Period 19. While the long-term mean remains centered around 110-115, the standard deviation has risen from approximately 22 to 30. For Period 31, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 22 through 26. I am setting L to 'default' as the promised and actual lead times are aligned at 4. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 (covering the period since the volatility shift in P19) to capture the current mean while smoothing out the recent high-variance demand samples (ranging from 53 to 147). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=12 to properly weight the increased volatility observed in the current regime, ensuring the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 26. The on-hand inventory is 109 and the pipeline is well-stocked with 443 units, including expected arrivals in the coming periods.

Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P27 order arriving in P31). To account for the higher volatility observed since Period 19 (N=13 periods of samples from P19 to P31), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant demand distribution (mean ~112, but with the higher standard deviation seen recently) while covering the lead time plus one review period (L+1=5).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility since Period 19, though the mean remains relatively stable around 112. The most recent demand samples (P29-P32: 130, 77, 141, 133) reflect this variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the P28 order arriving in P32. To address the higher volatility and prevent stockouts like the one in P26, I will use a larger N (N=14) for sigma_hat to capture the increased standard deviation observed since the regime shift around P19. For mu_hat, N=14 also covers this recent regime accurately. The OR backend will use these values to manage the current 45 units on-hand and 448 units in-transit against a lead time of 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime since Period 19 is characterized by a mean of approximately 112 units and significantly higher volatility (standard deviation ~30) compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history. In the most recent period (P33), we observed that the order from P29 arrived right on time (lead time of 4). Our current inventory position (on-hand 37 + in-transit 489 = 526) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Given the service level target (based on profit $4 and holding cost $1, q = 0.8), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the increased volatility of the current regime starting around P19 while maintaining a stable mean. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time is perfectly reliable.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues in the high-volatility regime identified around Period 19. Recent demand samples (P29-P34: 130, 77, 141, 133, 105, 74) show a mean of approximately 107. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P30 order in P34. Current on-hand inventory is 99, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 453 units (representing orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). To account for the sustained higher volatility observed since P19 (std ~30), I am using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering P19 to P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased variance while maintaining a stable mean estimate. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accommodates the wider demand swings seen in the second half of the game.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to reflect the high-volatility regime identified in Period 28. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 20), the average demand is approximately 111 units with a standard deviation of 26 units. The most recent demand (P35: 83, P34: 74) is slightly below this average, but given the volatility, it is prudent to maintain a buffer. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 78 and in-transit at 454 (covering orders from P32-P35), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=15 to capture the current mean and volatility accurately for the backend OR calculations. This ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) maintains a stable mean but continues to exhibit high volatility. Over the last 18 periods (since P19), the mean demand is approximately 111 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P32 order arrived P36). With on-hand inventory at 98 and 377 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the current high-volatility regime while maintaining a stable mean forecast. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility since Period 19, though the mean remains relatively stable. Analyzing the last 19 periods (P19-P37) to capture this higher variance phase, the mean demand is approximately 109 units per period with a standard deviation of about 29. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 137 units and there is a healthy pipeline of 376 units. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=19 will allow the OR backend to account for the increased volatility while maintaining an appropriate service level based on the current mean. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 periods matches observed actuals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility starting around Period 19, which was previously noted in carry-over insights. Analysis of demand from Period 19 to 38 yields a mean of approximately 111.4 and a standard deviation of 29.3. This mean is consistent with the long-term average (~112), but the higher standard deviation needs to be accounted for to maintain service levels. The lead time is very stable at 4 periods, consistently confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P34. Current on-hand inventory is 108 units, and in-transit is 370 units. Since the demand regime (mean ~112, higher volatility) has been sustained for 20 periods, I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture this behavior for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as the promised 4 periods matches observations perfectly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility starting around Period 19, which was confirmed in previous carry-over insights. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the mean demand is approximately 112.4 with a standard deviation of 26.6. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 39 conclusion confirms the P35 order arrived with a lead time of 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 26 units, but there are 440 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend OR logic will target a high service level (~80%). I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture the current demand regime and volatility while maintaining stability in the forecast. Setting L to default (4 periods) is appropriate as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 31-40) shows a stable mean of approximately 113.1 units with continuing high volatility (std ~28). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals of orders from P31 through P36. The stockout in Period 40 (only 102 units available for 139 demand) was caused by relatively small arrivals from P35 and P36. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Specifically, for L+1 = 5 periods, the backend should target a base stock level that covers the expected 565 units (5 * 113) plus a safety buffer for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable (P31-P40): mean ~113, high volatility (std ~28) sustained. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable with a mean of approximately 113 and a high standard deviation of approximately 28. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in multiple carry-over insights and historical conclude messages). Recent stockouts (P40) suggest that while the mean is stable, the high volatility requires careful management of the (L+1) demand window. In Period 41, 137 units arrived (from P37 order), leaving an on-hand inventory of 45. In-transit inventory is 502, consisting of orders from P38 (94), P39 (133), P40 (146), and P41 (129). The system expects a lead time of 4. I will use 'calculate' for L as it accurately captures the historical performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering P28 to P41) to capture the sustained high-volatility regime and the stable mean, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-volatility regime since Period 19. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P33-P42) shows a mean demand of approximately 111.9 and a standard deviation of 24.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P41 and P42). In Period 42, inventory dropped to 10 units, while 475 units are currently in-transit (ordered in P39, P40, P41, and P42). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current volatility regime while maintaining enough sample size for accuracy. Specifically, the OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) implies a service level of 0.80. Given the high volatility and current low on-hand stock, using the last 20 samples provides a balanced estimate of mean and variance for the safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P43) remains stable with a mean of approximately 114 and significant volatility (std ~26). The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P37, P38, and P39 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 30, and the pipeline contains orders from P40 to P43 (total 477 units). The OR backend calculates the base stock to cover (L+1) periods (approx 570 units total pipeline target). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 captures the current demand regime (P31-P43) while smoothing out the high period-to-period noise. Setting Lead Time to 'calculate' lets the system use the reliable historical 4-period observations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable with a mean of approximately 113 and a standard deviation of 28 (calculated over periods 31-44). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory position is 572 (120 on-hand + 452 in-transit). Given the 4-period lead time, we need enough inventory to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time window (5 periods total). The target base stock should be approximately (5 * 113) + z * (sqrt(5) * 28). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile q is 0.8, which gives a z-score of ~0.84. Target base stock = 565 + 0.84 * 62.6 \u2248 618. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P31-P44) will allow the OR backend to accurately reflect this current regime's parameters while maintaining the necessary service level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a stable regime characterized by a mean of approximately 113 and high volatility (standard deviation ~28). Recent periods (P41-P45) show demand values of 92, 129, 113, 56, and 98, averaging 97.6, which is slightly lower than the long-term trend but within expected variability. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P45 (ordered P41). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 151 units, with an in-transit pipeline of 365 units. Given that we are entering the final phases of the game (P46-P50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-volatility regime that has persisted since Period 31, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the observed standard deviation while balancing the high service level (80% quantile) against holding costs. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed historical average of 4.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=92, arrived=67 units (ordered on Period 42, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=218, demand=109, sold=109, ending on-hand inventory=109
Daily Profit: $436.00, Daily Holding Cost: $109.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable with a mean of approximately 112-115 per period and a sustained higher volatility (std ~28-30) since Period 19. My current on-hand inventory (109) plus the heavy pipeline (390 units across 4 expected arrivals) is sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (47, 48, 49, 50). Specifically, for Period 47, I have an arrival expected from the order placed in Period 43 (135 units). Lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods throughout the entire history. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current high-volatility regime and the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the established history. The service level (q) target remains high due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Profit: $212.00, Daily Holding Cost: $191.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a stable mean of approximately 112-113 units with high volatility (standard deviation around 28-30) since Period 19. Recent demand in Period 47 was low (53), leading to a higher on-hand inventory of 191 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive after the game ends. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current cycle. I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand and volatility to capture the high-variance regime established since Period 19, and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent decrease in the last 4 periods (P45-P48: 98, 109, 53, 84, mean=86) compared to the long-term stable mean of ~113. However, given the high volatility (std ~28-30) observed since Period 19, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower demand with the established historical average to avoid over-reacting to a potential short-term dip. On-hand inventory is currently high (228) with a strong pipeline (277). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). The backend OR logic will naturally reduce the order size this period given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the base stock calculation.

Daily Profit: $372.00, Daily Holding Cost: $177.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $195.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a stable mean but continues to exhibit high volatility. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is approximately 106.6, which is slightly lower than the previous regime mean of ~113. However, given the significant volatility (standard deviation remains around 28-30), I will use a recent window of N=10 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand behavior and ensure sufficient safety stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all observed historical arrivals. Current inventory (on-hand 177 + pipeline 299 = 476) is relatively high, which should protect against stockouts while the OR backend adjusts the order downward to optimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P41-P50): mean slightly decreased to ~107, but high volatility (std ~29) persists. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
