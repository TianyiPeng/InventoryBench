Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are given in the prompt) shows a mean of approximately 106.4 and a standard deviation of 17.9. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock levels immediately to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since this is the first decision, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the initial baseline for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will also use the 'default' lead time (4 periods). This ensures the OR backend initiates an order based on the initial statistical profile provided.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The first order of 136 units was placed in Period 1 and is in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 5. The starting on-hand inventory was 0, and the demand in Period 1 was 90, resulting in 90 lost sales. The current demand history shows a mean of approximately 104.4 units per period across 5 samples provided in the context (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the 'default' statistical methods for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) for this early stage of the game to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (136 units) and Period 2 (132 units) are currently in-transit (Total = 268) and are expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, current sales are zero because on-hand inventory is zero. Demand in the first two periods was 90 and 106, which is aligned with the historical average provided (approx 106). Since we have no completed arrivals yet, we cannot infer a true lead time different from the promised one. I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to encompass the known historical samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) plus the two observed periods (90, 106), as the demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~100. This ensures the OR engine calculates base stock based on the (L+1) window.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods (including provided sample data) series is [88, 133, 93, 108, 110], with an average of approximately 106.4 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (received at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 is expected. However, the current 'On-hand' is 0 and 'In-transit' is 385, while total demand has resulted in 0 units sold due to stockouts. To stabilize, I will use a 5-period average for demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture recent volatility. I will stick with the promised L=4 as there is no evidence yet of a lead-time shift since no orders could have arrived yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no inventory has arrived yet. In-transit represents the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (136+132+117+117 = 502). Demand has been relatively stable, ranging from 88 to 117 (mean ~107). Since L=4, the pipeline should cover L+1 (5) periods. Historical demand for the 5 periods provided is [88, 133, 93, 108, 110] - mean 106.4. The 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4 also show demand of [90, 106, 102, 117]. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the initial behavior, and use the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Analysis of Period 5's arrival shows that the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (arrived in P5 resolve phase), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand history: P1:88, P2:133, P3:93, P4:108, P5:110 (mean \u2248 106.4). Note: The 'Game History' demand labels (90, 106, 102, 117, 83) are observed 'concluded' demand which slightly differ but are consistent with a stable mean around 100-110. In-transit inventory (389) consists of orders from P2 (132), P3 (117), P4 (117), and P5 (23). The next arrival should be from P2 in Period 6's resolution phase. Since demand is stable and lead time is confirmed, I will use default methods for L and sigma, while using recent_N for mu_hat to anchor the forecast on the observed 5 periods of demand (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 129 units, with 313 units in-transit. Based on the game history, we have confirmed the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods (as seen in Period 5 and Period 6 conclusions). Demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend recently (88, 133, 93, 108, 110, 90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56). Calculating the mean for the full history of samples (including pre-game and game history): (88+133+93+108+110+90+106+102+117+83+56) / 11 = 98.7 units. However, looking at the most recent 3 periods (117, 83, 56), there is a visible decline. To be responsive but not overly reactive to the very low demand in Period 6 (which might be an outlier), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent trend while maintaining a safety buffer. For sigma_hat, I'll use the default calculation across all samples to ensure volatility is covered. L will be set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is: 90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56, 99 (Mean: ~93.3). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. The current inventory position is: On-hand (147) + In-transit (218) = 365 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Based on the historical mean of ~93.3, 5 periods of demand is approximately 466.5 units. The OR backend uses a capped policy, and since our pipeline (365) is lower than the target cover (~466), the system will place an order. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full observed demand history since the start, and default for lead time (4) and sigma_hat to maintain stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-88.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 91.5 (90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56, 99, 88). There is a slight drop in demand after P4, but it remains relatively stable. With a lead time L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover (L+1)=5 periods. Current on-hand is 176 and in-transit is 203 (total 379). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which means we should target the mean demand. Expected demand for 5 periods is ~457. Current inventory position (379) is below the median requirement. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed demand history while strictly adhering to the confirmed lead time L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stable demand pattern and consistent lead times. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through 5 consecutive arrivals (Orders from Periods 1-5 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). History shows a demand range of 56 to 117 units. Mean demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 92.8 units. The current on-hand inventory is 105, with 265 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). Since (L+1) is 5, and 5 * 93 = 465, our total pipeline (105 + 265 = 370) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. Calculating \u03bc\u0302 using a 5-period average (recent_N=5) captures the more recent lower-variance demand (avg ~85) compared to the early volatility. Setting L to default (4) is appropriate. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to react to the slightly lower recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods for all five arrivals to date (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 11. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 10 periods shows a mean of 96.5 units per period. Recently (Period 10), demand spiked to 130, which is slightly above the previous average range but within the standard deviation if we consider the early periods (P2, P4). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is low (31 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (259 units), which represents orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. According to the mechanics, the P7 order (22 units) should arrive during Period 11 and be visible in the next report. The total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 290. Using L=4, the base stock targets demand over 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~97, we expect 5*97 = 485 units to be the rough target. Since pipeline is 290, the system will order to close that gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history while allowing the backend to handle the L+1 calculations. L=4 is stable.

In Period 12, we are facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 in P6, ..., P7 in P11). In Period 11, we could only satisfy 53 units of the 104 units demanded because only 22 units arrived (the small order from Period 7). The pipeline currently consists of 367 units (orders from P8-P11). Demand has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~100. For the OR backend, I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent demand profile while excluding the seed data that may not reflect current variability. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR engine will target through its base-stock calculation.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 98.4 units over the first 12 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in periods 5 through 12, with no missing shipments detected yet. In Period 11, we experienced a stockout (sold 53 vs. demand 104) due to low inventory levels, but the arrival of 102 units in Period 12 has replenished the stock to 20 units on-hand. Considering a lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using all 12 available samples provides a stable mean of 98.4 and a standard deviation of 19.4. This creates a base stock that aims to satisfy demand while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0), implying a service level target of 0.50. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 14. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The carry-over insights and history confirm that every order from Period 1 to Period 9 arrived with a lead time of 4. Demand remains relatively stable. Average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation around 19 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=13 (all game history) to capture the current stable regime. Based on L=4, mu_hat should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The backend will calculate 5 * ~96 = ~480. Given current On-hand (8) + In-transit (390) = 398, the backend will target a base stock high enough to cover the expected demand while considering the service level (0.50 since profit and holding cost are both $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding the limited arrivals in Period 14. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand (mu_hat) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 100 units per period. The recent N=10 approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to capture the current demand regime and volatility (mean ~100.2, std ~14.7). The OR backend uses a base stock policy (L+1 periods covered), which is appropriate here given the Lead Time of 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent historical performance of 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are both $1.0, the service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand over the review period + lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the data confirms a stable promised lead time (L=4) based on 11 consecutive arrivals (P5-P15). The current on-hand inventory is 32 units, with 342 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). Demand over the last 15 periods has been relatively stable, ranging from 56 to 130, with a mean of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of 17.6. Recently (P10-P15), we see slightly higher volatility (130, 104, 82, 97, 110, 98). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to better reflect recent demand variance and level (mean ~102), as the earliest periods included a lower demand outlier (56). Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z*=0).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by 12 consecutive arrivals (P5 through P16). Recent demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 98.7 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), showing less volatility than the initial startup phase. Current on-hand inventory is 53 units, with 328 units in-transit (P13: 91, P14: 82, P15: 50, P16: 105). The OR backend's default profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level which we'll support using recent demand statistics. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to focus on this stable demand regime and ensure the base stock is calculated based on current levels rather than early outliers.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by 13 consecutive arrivals (P1-P13). Demand remains relatively stable between 82 and 130 units per period. The recent mean (last 7 periods) is approximately 99.1 units. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which targets the mean demand. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 356) plus current On-hand (40) equals 396 units, covering approximately 4 periods of future demand (L+1=5). To minimize stockouts observed in P11 and P14 while respectably managing holding costs, I will use a 7-period window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility and maintain a base stock that accounts for the historical 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) after Period 18, following several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (Periods 11, 13, 14). Demand has been relatively stable across the entire history, though it slightly increased in the most recent periods (avg of last 5 periods: ~106 vs overall avg ~100). The lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by every arrival from P1 to P14). I will use a recent_N approach for both demand and lead time to capture the latest demand intensity and ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1=5 periods) are sufficient. Setting N=10 for demand calculation balances recent volatility with the established mean, ensuring the OR engine targets a service level dictated by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.5, z*=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 19's conclusion, with a stock-out occurring in Period 19 (56 units sold vs 112 demand). Historical demand analysis (P1-P19) shows a stable mean of approximately 101 units per period (standard deviation ~16). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all arrivals to date. We are currently in a cycle where arrivals (from P15, P16, etc.) are slightly lower than the average demand, leading to stock-outs. To recover and maintain an optimal service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, though the backend policy uses a higher internal target for safety), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out initial noise. The 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' will be calculated based on the last 15 periods. Lead time 'L' remains at the default promised value of 4, which aligns with observed reality.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 20, lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-20). The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady, with a slight upward trend in recent periods (mean of last 5 periods \u2248 110 vs. overall mean \u2248 100). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 19 and 20 because arrivals (50 and 105 units) were insufficient to cover demand (112 and 121 units). To stabilize the service level and account for the slight demand increase, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture current fluctuations better than the long-term average. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but the backend capping and the pipeline inventory calculation will help prevent excessive holding costs while attempting to recover from the current stockout.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by 13 consecutive arrivals from Period 5 to Period 21. No orders are lost; the 'In-transit' quantity (390) correctly accounts for orders placed in Periods 18 (99), 19 (125), 20 (43), and 21 (123). Demand has been relatively stable across the history (approximate mean ~101), though there's minor volatility (std ~16). With profit ($1) equal to holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is stable, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=17 to capture the full revealed distribution after initial stock-outs were resolved, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 102 units per period (last 10 periods average: 104.2). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory review: On-hand is low (17), but in-transit is 375, which covers approximately 3.6 periods of demand. The order for Period 19 (125 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of the current Period 23. To prevent stockouts, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent demand level (approx 104 units/period), and setting L to 'calculate' as historical lead times are very stable at 4. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via z*=0.

chips(Regular): ordered=121, arrived=125 units (ordered on Period 19, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=142, demand=86, sold=86, ending on-hand inventory=56

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by all arrivals through Period 23 (latest arrival from Period 19 order). Current on-hand inventory is 56 units with 371 units in-transit. Demand analysis over the last 23 periods shows fairly stable behavior with a mean around 101.5 and a standard deviation around 16.5. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in the recent demand samples (P19-P23: 112, 121, 96, 105, 86). Given that Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution. I will use a recent window of N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable distribution while discounting the very early initialization phase, and keep L at default since it is reliable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, signaling a risk of stockouts. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable, with a mean around 101 units over the last 20 periods and minimal variance. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. Since the profit per unit and holding cost per unit are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with the base-stock logic of targeting the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). I will set L to 'calculate' to utilize the stable 4-period history and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out initial noise. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to provide a calibrated buffer against the observed volatility in this period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 37 units with 372 units in-transit. Based on the history from Period 5 to Period 25, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable; the mean demand over the last 15 periods (Periods 11-25) is approximately 101.2 units, while the mean over all 25 periods is 100.8 units. There is no evidence of a significant regime shift, although stockouts occurred in Periods 11, 14, 19, 20, and 24 due to timing gaps in arrivals relative to demand spikes. To ensure the base stock calculation reflects the most stable recent demand profile while accounting for lead time (L=4), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the minor variations in recent demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to reflect recent volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with some minor fluctuations but no clear structural shifts (average demand is approximately 100 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as evidenced by Period 26's arrival (ordered in P22, arrived 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 40 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 384 units (comprising orders from Periods 23, 24, 25, and 26). The OR backend's service level logic (profit/profit+holding) results in a target q of 0.5, but since demand variability is moderate, maintaining a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent 10 periods of stability (Periods 17-26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean around 100 units/period (average over all 27 periods is 101.4). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in every 'conclude' message since Period 5). Despite occasional stockouts (Periods 11, 14, 19, 20, 24), the on-hand inventory is healthy (65 units) and there is a significant pipeline in-transit (343 units). The OR backend's target service level is 50% (q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5) because Profit = Holding Cost, which implies the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there are no observed shifts in demand or lead time, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=20 to capture the most stable representative window of recent activity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-28) has stabilized around a mean of 94.25 (86, 81, 96, 119, 86, 105, 96, 119) compared to the overall average of 100.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (18), but there is a significant pipeline of 364 units. Given Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability in demand while maintaining responsiveness to the recent slight uptick in volatility (std of recent demand is approx 13.9). This sets the base stock around 472 units. With Pipeline + On-hand = 382, the OR engine will order approximately 90 units, consistent with the mean.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the observed period, with an average around 100 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P25). Given the stable demand profile and the established lead time, I will use recent history (N=20) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This N provides a robust balance between capturing recent fluctuations and maintaining stability. The on-hand inventory is currently low (13 units), but the in-transit pipeline (368 units) is healthy. By setting L to the promised lead time (4) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend can maintain the target service level based on the most representative recent data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 101 units per period over the last 10 periods (P21-P30). Although there was a stockout in Period 30, the demand signal does not indicate a significant structural regime shift. The in-transit pipeline (396 units) is healthy and corresponds well to the expected arrivals from the last four periods (P27-P30 orders: 80, 93, 99, 124 = 396), confirming that the delivery system is stable with a lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable yet fluctuating pattern, while keeping L at the promised 'default' of 4 as actual lead times remain perfectly aligned with expectations.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 31 where demand (84) exceeded the arriving units (80). Historical lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P5 through P31. Demand is stable; over the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand is 101.4 units with a standard deviation of 12.3. Given lead time L=4, we must cover demand for the next L+1 = 5 periods. The pipeline inventory (410 units) consists of orders from P28 (93), P29 (99), P30 (124), and P31 (94). I will use a 15-period lookback window (recent_N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet slightly volatile demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for approximately 507 units of pipeline risk (5 * 101.4).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is 94.4 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every single arrival conclusion desde P5. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (11 units) and there have been stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P30, P31, P24), suggesting that the base stock needs to be slightly more responsive to recent demand fluctuations and inventory depletion. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the historical consistency is high.

Demand has been relatively stable, with some minor fluctuations but no significant trend change. I will use the 'calculate' method for L since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods consistently. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=20 to capture the current demand regime and account for recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable throughout the 34 periods, with a mean around 99 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 100.5 with a standard deviation of 16.5. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 47, and in-transit inventory is 362 units (total pipeline of 409). Given the (L+1) horizon requirement, a base stock targeting a slightly higher service level is appropriate because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% critical fractile. However, to avoid stockouts which have occurred frequently (Periods 11, 14, 19, 20, 24, 30, 31, 33), I will use a slightly more conservative demand estimate. Since there's no strong evidence of a recent regime shift, I'll use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock and cap the order.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98.7 units over the last 15 periods (P21-P35), with no significant seasonal or trend shifts detected. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 48 units, and in-transit inventory is 358 units. To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (given profit and holding cost are both $1.0/unit, implying a 50% critical ratio target for the base stock level), I will use the last 15 periods to estimate demand mean and variance. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the observed consistency. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the most representative recent demand distribution.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 36 periods, with no detectable regime shifts or upcoming seasonal events indicated by the generic 'Period_X' labels. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals since Period 5 (P1-P32). In-transit inventory of 336 units covers orders from Periods 33-36 (48+124+90+74=336), which is consistent with the lead time. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the backend will target the mean demand. I will use a window of the last 20 periods (N=20) for demand parameters to capture the current stable mean and variance while filtering out early noise. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable throughout the game, with a long-term mean around 98 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages. As of Period 38, the on-hand inventory is 0, following a slight stockout in Period 37 where demand (104) exceeded starting on-hand + arrivals (100). The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 396 units, which consists of orders from Periods 34 (124 units), 35 (90 units), 36 (74 units), and 37 (108 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 38, 39, 40, and 41 respectively. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). To maintain stability and prevent over-correction from the recent stockout, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility. I've chosen N=10 to capture recent variance while smoothing out the minor stockout impact.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable throughout the last 38 periods, with a mean around 100 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the most recent one in Period 38 (ordered in P34). Current on-hand inventory is low (10 units) after a demand spike of 114 in Period 38. The in-transit pipeline (368 units) consists of orders from Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38. To ensure adequate coverage for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the recent 20 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable but slightly volatile nature of the demand without over-responding to individual spikes. This approach maintains a defensive base stock level balanced against equal profit and holding costs (target service level ~50% via the OR backend).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 99.4 units per period across the last 15 periods (P25-P39), with a standard deviation of about 14.1. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is low (8 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 396 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand over the (L+1) period risk horizon. Given the stable demand, recent_N with N=15 is used for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time (L) is set to 4 based on consistent historical evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 40 periods. There is no evidence of seasonal shifts or recent regime changes in demand. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the beginning of the simulation (observed in every shipment from Period 5 to Period 40). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 403 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which matches our observations. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistently observed 4-period duration. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to filter out early noise while maintaining a robust long-term average. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the standard deviation of the current regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the history, with a mean around 98 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 14. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1 through P37). For Period 42, we need to ensure the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory is 401 (10 on-hand + 391 in-transit). Given the average demand, we expect to need approximately 490 units over 5 periods. I am using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to capture current demand fluctuations while maintaining stable L=4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the game, with a mean around 99 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival in Period 42 from the order placed in Period 38). Inventory management is currently lean, with only 21 units on-hand and some historical stockouts (Cycles 30, 31, 33, 37, 40). To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0, implying a 50% critical ratio or z=0 for base stock, though the capped policy adds protection), I will use the recent 10 periods to capture the current demand mean and volatility more accurately than the full history. This N=10 window covers a representative range of the stable regime. The L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the game, with a long-term average around 98 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 14. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Current inventory state: On-hand is 41, and In-transit is 355 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, the OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The In-transit plus On-hand inventory (396 units) is already roughly 4 periods of demand (avg ~98). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=20 will capture the stable demand regime while filtering out early noise. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the last 15-20 periods, with standard deviation around 12-13. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across the entire game history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 11, and in-transit inventory is 364 units (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we are at Period 45 out of 50, and lead time is 4, orders placed now (P45) will arrive at the start of Period 49 and be available for demand in Period 49 and 50. I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand and standard deviation to capture the steady state and 'calculate' for lead time since the historical evidence is very consistent at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The game concludes at the end of Period 50. Orders placed now (Period 46) with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive during Period 50 and be available for demand resolution in that final period. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, Period 46 is the last critical ordering period for general inventory replenishment. Historical demand is stable around a mean of ~100. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals). I will use N=20 for demand estimation to capture recent variance while maintaining stability. Period 45 ended with 0 on-hand inventory, and there are 382 units in-transit (orders from Periods 42, 43, 44, and 45). The target is to ensure enough stock for the remaining 5 periods of demand (46, 47, 48, 49, 50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of approximately 99 units over the last 10 periods, with no significant seasonal or external calendar drivers identified for this period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Current inventory is low (On-hand: 5), with a healthy pipeline (In-transit: 407). My objective is to maintain a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, which conceptually aligns the base stock closely with the expected demand over the lead time plus review period. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variance while maintaining stability. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=89, arrived=91 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=96, demand=112, sold=96, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Orders placed in Period 44 (arrives P48), Period 45 (arrives P49), and Period 46 (arrives P50) are the last ones that will contribute to inventory. My current in-transit (405 units) covers orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47. Since we cannot receive any more stock after Period 50, and the total length of the remaining game is 3 periods (48, 49, 50), I will set parameters to ensure we do not over-order for periods beyond the horizon while maintaining enough to cover the remaining demand. The historical demand mean is approximately 98 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand volatility and mean, ensuring L is grounded at the confirmed 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $90.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Reviewing history, actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (e.g., P44 order arrived in P48). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around 100 units per period. Average demand across all 48 periods is approximately 100. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 102.5. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, which is outside the simulation window. However, the OR engine requires parameters to manage the current state. I will set L to 'default' (4) as confirmed by history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current demand regime and volatility accurately. The in-transit inventory is 415 units, covering approximately 4 periods of demand, which aligns with the lead-time requirement.

Daily Profit: $78.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the 50 periods, typically fluctuating between 80 and 120 units per period. The mean demand across all observed samples (P1-P49) is approximately 98.7 units. The system is currently at Period 50. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will aim to stock approximately the mean demand for the (L+1) period window. Since there have been no significant shifts in demand regime or lead time behavior, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most stable recent demand profile while filtering out very old noise, and 'calculate' for L to leverage the reliable historical lead time data.
