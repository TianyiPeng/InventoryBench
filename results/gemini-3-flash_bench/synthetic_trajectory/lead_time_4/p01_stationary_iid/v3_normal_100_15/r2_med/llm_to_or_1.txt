Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (samples provided) are: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110. The mean of these samples is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.5. Since we have no specific calendar date or product context beyond 'Regular chips', I will use the baseline statistics provided. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (Review period=1), the OR engine needs parameters for 1+L = 5 periods. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided history specifically. This will calculate mu_hat = 5 * 106.4 = 532 and sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 17.5 = 39.1. L is set to 'default' (4).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 136 units were ordered and 90 units were demanded. Since on-hand inventory was 0, all 90 units of demand were lost (sold=0). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the delivery sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (136 units) will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand and 136 in-transit. Demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) suggest an average demand of approximately 106 units per period. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is not yet enough evidence of a regime shift, which will utilize the provided historical demand samples (N=5).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (136 units) and Period 2 (132 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 268). Per the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning it will first be observable in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are missing sales due to initial stockout. Demand in Period 1 (90) and Period 2 (106) is relatively stable compared to the provided historical samples (Mean: 106.4, Std: 16.2). Since we are only at Period 3, there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise or that a regime shift has occurred. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the most recent samples including the 5 historical points plus 2 game periods (N=7).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 5 (1+4=5) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, zero arrivals for Periods 1-3 is expected behavior. Current demand mean is ~106.4 based on 5 samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). Standard deviation is ~17.2. Since inventory is currently 0 and in-transit is 398 (sum of orders from P1, P2, P3: 136+132+130=398), the pipeline is healthy. I will use 'default' for L to stick to promised lead time and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods (including current data point) is 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (Mean \u2248 106.4). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4 have not arrived yet. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at the start of P6). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in P1-P4 conclude messages is expected behavior for L=4. There are currently 515 units in-transit. On-hand is 0, leading to lost sales because the initial system started with 0 inventory and a 4-period lead time. I will maintain L=4. I will use the mean of all 5 available samples to project demand. The backend OR will calculate the base stock to cover demand over (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have reached Period 6. Based on the Period 5 conclude message, the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time = 4). No shipments are currently lost or overdue. Demand over the first 5 periods (90, 106, 102, 117, 83) shows a mean of approximately 100 with moderate variance. Since current on-hand inventory is 53 and we have 417 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5), the pipeline is healthy. I will use the default lead time (4) and'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant baseline while the backend calculates the order to maintain the pipeline for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is stabilizing as the initial orders are arriving. I have confirmed that the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 129, with 339 units in-transit. Demand over the first 6 periods has shown some variance (range 56-117), with a mean of 92.3. However, demand in the last two periods (83, 56) has been lower than the initial burst. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization of the supply chain and current consumer behavior, while maintaining L=4. This ensures the base stock formula (1+L) covers demand through the lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Looking at the conclude messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7, we have confirmed that orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the first 7 periods has shown a mean of approximately 93 units (90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56, 99). Recent demand (Periods 5-7) shows a slight dip (avg 79) compared to the initial periods (avg 104), but it's not yet a sustained regime change. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both demand and sigma to capture the full recent history while being responsive to the observed noise. The current on-hand inventory (160) and in-transit (251) are being replenished regularly now that the initial lead time gap has passed.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (Confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). Current on-hand inventory is 189, and in-transit is 227 (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Historical demand (P1-P8) shows a mean of 92.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.8. Demand appears relatively stable around the 90-100 range after the initial few periods. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total pipeline (416 units) is currently high relative to current demand expectations (5 * ~93 = 465). The OR backend's safety stock logic (z* with q = 4/5 = 0.8) will naturally adjust orders. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand and standard lead time settings to ensure the forecast reflects the available history while ignoring the early-game zero-sales artifacts (since sales were zero only due to no stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in P1 through P5). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of approximately 92.5 units per period over the last 9 periods (ranging from 56 to 117). The current 'In-transit' quantity of 271 units reflects orders from P6 (54), P7 (42), P8 (93), and P9 (82), totaling exactly 271. With an on-hand inventory of 133 and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) should cover demand for Periods 10-14. Using the recent 9-period data range (P1-P9) provides a stable estimate of the mean and variance for the OR optimizer to set the base stock level. The 'cap' logic in the backend will prevent over-ordering if the pipeline is already saturated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $463.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 11. Historical analysis of the 'conclude' messages confirms a steady lead time of 4 periods (as seen from P5 to P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some fluctuations but remains relatively stable. Average demand over the first 10 periods is approximately 96.5 units. Recent demand (P10) spiked to 130, which may indicate a slight increase in variance or a new higher demand level. Currently, we have 57 units on-hand and 310 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline of 310 plus on-hand 57 (Total 367) is roughly equivalent to 5 periods of average demand (5 * 96.5 = 482.5). However, the capped stock keeps us conservative. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the overall average while being sensitive to the late increase, and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 is being strictly met.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The historical lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on 7 consecutive successful arrivals (P5-P11). The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 398 units, representing orders from P8 (93), P9 (82), P10 (93), and P11 (130). The demand for the last 11 periods averages 97 units, but the most recent two periods (P10 and P11) saw a surge (130 and 104), and we have unmet demand from P11. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=6 captures the demand variability since the inventory stabilized around P5. Maintaining the promised lead time L=4 is appropriate as it matches observed performance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 8. Total pipeline inventory is 429 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12), but the on-hand inventory is very low (11 units) following a stockout in Period 11 and a recovery in Period 12. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 12 periods (P1-P12) showing an average of 95.8 units per period (Std Dev ~19). Using recent_N with N=12 focuses on the current demand regime. With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters aim to replenish inventory to cover this window while accounting for the high 'In-transit' volume to avoid over-ordering, as the OR backend will subtract the pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (observed from arrivals in Periods 5 through 13). Demand has shown relative stability with an average of approximately 96 units over the last 13 periods and 101 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 13 where we missed 4 units of demand. We have 422 units in transit, corresponding to orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. To stabilize the service level and recover from the low inventory position, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most representative recent demand mean (approx 98.7) while smoothing short-term fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 490-500 units), which balances the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (as seen from Period 5 to Period 14 concludes). Inventory management is currently struggling with stockouts (ending on-hand inventory was 0 for Periods 11, 13, and 14). Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 10 periods (P5-P14) averaging approximately 94.4 units per period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 421) represents orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 (130+124+75+92 = 421), which are due to arrive in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18 respectively. To stabilize service levels and overcome the current stockout phase, I will use recent trends (last 10 periods) to set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat', reflecting the actual demand regime since delivery began. I will stick with the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is low (32 units) and we have experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in Periods 11, 13, and 14 due to demand volatility and the lead time lag. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the start of the game (including pre-history), demand has shown a relatively stable mean; however, recent periods (P10-P15) show a slightly higher variance and average compared to the early periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current demand level (~102 per period) across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a robust base stock to prevent further lost sales. I am using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to better reflect the recent demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 1 through Period 12, all showing a lead time of exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 58 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline contains orders from Period 13 (75 units), Period 14 (92 units), Period 15 (88 units), and Period 16 (88 units), totaling 343 units. This pipeline aligns perfectly with the expected lead time and past order history. Demand has shown some fluctuation but remains around a mean of 96-98 units over the last 16 periods. Period 11, 13, and 14 experienced stockouts, but current in-transit levels are more robust. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability while smoothing out the early period variance, and use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 29 units, with 390 units in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent sample (P17) at 104 and the previous five periods (P13-P17) averaging 102.8 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders from P1 through P13. Currently, the pipeline is full with orders placed from P14 to P17 (92, 88, 88, 122 units respectively). Given the consistent lead time performance, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), the last 10 periods show slightly more variance but a similar mean (approx 100-105) compared to the start; I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand level while smoothing short-term fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), remains responsive to the current average.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 18 periods, with no strong seasonal or event-driven trends visible from the generic 'Period_N' markers. The average demand across all historical data (including the seed samples) is approximately 100 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the 'conclude' messages. Recent inventory levels have been tight, with stockouts occurring in Periods 11, 13, and 14 due to demand exceeding on-hand supply. As of Period 19, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but in-transit inventory is high (407 units), representing roughly 4 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the full confirmed history of actual demand which averages 98.6. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=18 to accurately estimate the standard deviation (~16.6) without including the initial high uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 19 where demand (112) exceeded available stock (93). Historical demand for chips(Regular) remains stable, with the most recent 10-period average (Periods 10-19) being 104.4 units. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline contains 431 units, which includes orders from Period 16 (88), 17 (122), 18 (109), and 19 (112); the Period 16 order is expected to arrive during Period 20's arrival resolution phase. To maintain a high service level given the stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand forecasting to capture the current mean of ~104 units per period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 520 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable around a mean of 104 units (Periods 10-19 average: 104.4); lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and 462 units in-transit. The previous two periods (P19, P20) resulted in stockouts where demand exceeded arrivals, indicating a need to stabilize inventory levels. The demand mean remains stable; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P11-P20) is 104.3 units, consistent with the previous carry-over insight. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline is substantial (462 units), the OR backend's capped policy will manage the actual order quantity to prevent overstocking once arrivals catch up. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=10) to reflect the current steady-state demand more accurately than the full history, which includes early outliers. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4, as it has been consistent.

The current demand remains stable following the pattern established over the last 15+ periods (mean ~104). Period 21 saw a demand of 96, and the previous 10 periods (11-20) averaged 104.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the Period 17 order arriving in Period 21. On-hand inventory is 26, with 421 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P18, P19, P20, and P21). I will continue using recent_N=15 for demand parameters to capture the stable regime and use the default lead time (4) which matches observations.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable with no detectable regime shifts or seasonal spikes in the recent history. For the period range 10-22, the average demand is approximately 105.8 units with a standard deviation around 11.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 30 units and the in-transit pipeline (sum of orders from P19 to P22: 112+119+81+94 = 406) is robust. I am setting L to default (4) as the lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=10 to capture the most recent stable demand regime (P13-P22 average is ~106) and ensure the OR backend computes a base stock that covers the lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5) while maintaining an appropriate service level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio (critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80).

Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Current inventory status: On-hand is 56, and In-transit is 403. The pipeline inventory (459 total) covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current rate. Since the base stock calculation targets (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to cover the lead time plus the review period, and given our profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), the backend will maintain a buffer. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable demand regime while filtering out the slightly higher variance from the early game (Periods 1-10).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101.4 units over the last 10 periods (P15-P24). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals since Period 5. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 75 units and a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 368 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. With a stable demand pattern and no upcoming known seasonal events based on the current period label, I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand statistics and ensure the backend OR policy calculates a base stock that accounts for current inventory and the full pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 100-105 units over the last 15 periods (Periods 11-25 average: 101.1). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages from Period 5 through Period 25. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 70 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 382 units, which is consistent with the rolling sum of the last ~4 orders. Given the stable demand and reliable lead time, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this stable regime, and 'calculate' for L to leverage the consistent historical lead time data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime. The recent 10-period average (P17-P26) is approximately 95.3 units, slightly lower than the P10-P19 average of 104 units, suggesting a minor cooling but no dramatic shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods per historical arrivals (most recently P26 confirming the P22 order arrived in 4 periods). On-hand inventory is healthy at 83 units, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 362 units, which effectively covers the next 4 periods of expected demand (~380-400 units). I will use recent_N with N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand trend while maintaining the default lead time of 4. This approach ensures a high service level while preventing excessive stock buildup as demand stabilizes near 95.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable with a slight decrease: Period 17-26 average is 95.3 units compared to earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown stability with a slight downward adjustment. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 27 is approximately 98.7 units, which is a decrease from the earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as observed in the most recent conclusion. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 96 and in-transit inventory of 337 units (representing orders from Periods 24, 25, 26, and 27). The total pipeline plus on-hand inventory is 433 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. A base stock target around 500 units (mean ~100 * 5) is reasonable to maintain service levels. Using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 captures the most recent regime shift (the slight decrease noted in carry-over insights).

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the long term. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P19-P28) is 99.1 units. A recent slight increase in demand was observed in Period 28 (119 units), but it is not yet sustained enough to classify as a regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability and volatility (standard deviation approx 13.5). The on-hand inventory is 61, and in-transit is 345, which covers approximately 4.1 periods of demand at the current average. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is 99.0 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the early periods but maintaining a consistent range (81-121). The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods as consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 56, and Pipeline inventory is 372 (totaling 428). Given lead time L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (L+1). With an average demand of ~99, the expected 5-period demand is ~495. I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly reduced but stable demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: Periods 20-29 average is 99.0 units, a moderate decrease from the initial mean (~104) but consistently stable with L=4.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), with an average of 97.9 units. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (20 units), and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 391 units. My goal is to maintain a base stock level that covers demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). An average of ~98 units per period suggests a target base stock around 490 units. Given the in-transit inventory of 391 and on-hand 20 (total 411), the backend will order approximately 80 units, which aligns well with recent demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability in demand while ignoring the slightly higher noise from earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a recent average (Periods 21-31) of approximately 96.7 units per period. The lead time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 20 and the in-transit pipeline is 408 units, the total inventory position is 428. According to the base-stock policy definition (base_stock = (1+L) * mu), a base stock for 5 periods (1+L) at the recent average demand would be approximately 483 units. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (tracking the stable regime since Period 21) allows the OR backend to capture the current mean and variance effectively for this SKU. This parameter set balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost by aiming for a service level q = 0.8.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) is approximately 94.4 units, which is slightly lower than the overall historical average but consistent with the recent stability noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 30 units and a massive pipeline of 394 units (covering roughly 4 periods of demand at ~100/period), the system is well-supplied. I will use recent_N (N=10) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable-but-slightly-lower demand regime accurately, ensuring we don't over-order while maintaining a safe buffer for the Lead Time + 1 review cycle.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the observed periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is approximately 98.5 units, which is consistent with the long-term average reported in previous carry-over insights (~99-104 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by the arrival data (e.g., the P29 order arrived exactly in P33). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 29 units and 345 units in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover demand over L+1 = 5 periods. I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent stable demand regime while filtering out minor fluctuations. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost using the inventory currently in the pipeline.

The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals. I will use a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture the most current stable regime while filtering out noise. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the consistently observed 4-period lead time. This configuration maintains a high service level while managing holding costs by aligning the base stock with recent demand patterns.

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 95-100 units over the last 15 periods (Periods 21-35 average approximately 95 units, with the most recent 10-period average at 97.4). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P31 order arriving in P35). We are currently at Period 36 of 50, with on-hand inventory of 53 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 365 units. Given that total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 418) already covers more than 4 periods of average demand (approx 380-400), the OR backend will moderate new orders. I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand to capture the current stable regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the observed periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 94.4 units, which is consistent with the long-term historical mean. Although demand reached as high as 123 (P33) and as low as 77 (P34), there is no evidence of a sustained regime shift or seasonal spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P31 to P36). With in-transit inventory at 375, and current on-hand at 39, the total system inventory (414) covers more than 4 periods of future demand (assuming ~94-100 units/period). I will continue using the promised lead time of 4 and use a recent 15-period sample (N=15) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the current stability while being responsive to recent variance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained very stable over the last 15+ periods. Analyzing the recent 10-period window (Periods 28-37), the average demand is 97.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the Period 33 order arriving exactly as expected in Period 37. On-hand inventory is currently low (8 units), but the pipeline (In-transit: 393) is healthy, covering about 4 periods of demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am maintaining a base stock policy that ensures high service levels. I will use a recent_N of 15 for both demand and volatility to capture the established stable regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the recent periods. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 98.2 units, which is consistent with the long-term stable regime identified in previous insights (~99-104 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current inventory is low (on-hand: 18), but there is a significant pipeline (372 units in-transit) which includes expected arrivals for the next 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred (q=0.8). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most current stable demand behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the calculate method for L as the lead time of 4 periods is well-established through historical arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit stability. The mean demand for the most recent 10-period window (Periods 30-39) is approximately 96.1 units, which is consistent with previous analysis in the Carry-Over Insights. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the game history, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 16), which is expected as Period 39 ended with 16 units after demand resolution. In-transit inventory (405 units) covers the next four arrivals (orders from Periods 36, 37, 38, and 39). Given the stable demand and reliable 4-period lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime while maintaining a focus on recent variance. I'll stick to 'calculate' for lead time since the historical evidence for L=4 is overwhelming and consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stable: Periods 30-39 average is 96.1 units, maintaining the consistent trend around 95-100 units observed since Period 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a narrow range (approx. 95-100 units) for over 20 periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Recently, starting inventory has been low, leading to minor stockouts (e.g., Period 40). With an 'In-transit' of 410 units and 'On-hand' at 0, the pipeline currently covers roughly 4 periods of demand. Given the stable demand regime (Period 30-39 average is 96.1, Period 1-40 average is approx 98), I will utilize recent_N=11 (tracking the last 10 concluded periods plus the current observed regime) to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for recent consumption patterns.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98.7 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). Current inventory is critical as on-hand is 0 and we are currently experiencing stockouts (Period 40-41 sold < demand). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent stable demand regime while accounting for the current stockout pressure. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock based on this mean and the standard deviation of the last 10 periods, factoring in the L=4 lead time (total 5 periods of coverage). This ensures we order enough to recover from the current stockout while not over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 95-100 units since approximately Period 20. The last 10 periods (P33-P42) show an average demand of approximately 98.5 units. The actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 18 units with 417 units in transit. Since the target service level (q) is 0.8 (Profit $4 / ($4+$1)), the OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size relative to the pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods to capture the current stable regime (averaging approx 97.4 units) while allowing for recent volatility. L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised and consistently observed lead time of 4.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 96-98 units over the last 20 periods (Periods 24-43 average: 97.4). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (P39 order arriving in P43) adhering to this. Currently, we have 43 units on hand and 368 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43). Given the critical nature of the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand. With profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). To ensure stability as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to reflect the consistent demand regime and setting L to its promising value which aligns with observations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained exceptionally stable over the long term. Analyzing recent performance, the average demand over the last 15 periods (P30-P44) is approximately 98.7 units, and the last 5 periods (P40-P44) average 100.4 units. This indicates a consistent demand regime around the 99-100 unit mark. The lead time is confirmed as a steady 4 periods (as evidenced by the P40 order arriving in P44). In-transit inventory is 375 units (likely comprising orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44), and on-hand is 25 units. Total pipeline (400) covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current mean. I will continue using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable regime while allowing for slight historical volatility, as the demand shows no signs of high-frequency shifts or impending seasonality based on the provided generic dates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime. The recent 10-period average (Periods 36-45) is 101.0 units, and the 20-period average (Periods 26-45) is 98.6 units. There is no significant upward or downward trend based on the calendar (Period 46). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by the most recent arrivals from Periods 40 and 41). The current on-hand inventory is 28 units with 379 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 42-45). I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the long-term stable variance and mean while including the slightly higher demand observed in the last few periods. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is verified by history.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistently stable over recent periods, with a mean of approximately 99.4 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) and 98.7 units over the last 20 periods (P27-P46). Lead time is verified at exactly 4 periods, with the arrival on Period 46 confirming the Period 42 order. The on-hand inventory is 37 units and in-transit is 400 units (representing orders from P43, P44, P45, and P46). Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (L=4) will arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 51 and become visible at the start of Period 52. However, the simulation ends concluding Period 50. Therefore, while I maintain standard parameters to ensure the OR engine manages the base stock correctly for the remaining horizons, I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand and standard lead time calculations to reflect the stable regime.

chips(Regular): ordered=83, arrived=74 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=111, demand=112, sold=111, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $444.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains stable with a mean around 99 units over the last 10 periods (P38-P47 average: 99.4) and a standard deviation of approximately 11.7 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P47: P43 order arrived, L=4). Current inventory is effectively zero (on-hand is 0, and recent high demand suggests backlog or immediate depletion). While the in-transit amount of 409 units covers approximately 4 periods of future demand (4 * 99 = 396), we are entering the final periods of the simulation (P48-P50). For Period 48, using a lead time 'L' of 4 means the order will arrive in Period 52, which is outside the simulation window. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the base stock level relative to the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both demand and lead-time related parameters to capture the current stable regime while filtering out earlier, slightly higher demand periods. This maintains a lean inventory policy appropriate for the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 50 is the final demand resolution phase. Any inventory arriving in Period 50 can satisfy Period 50 demand, but any inventory ordered now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the scope of this 50-period game. Therefore, the order placed this period is irrelevant to the total reward. The key objective is to have enough on-hand inventory to meet Period 49 and Period 50 demand. However, the simulation mechanics dictate that orders placed in Period 49 arrive at the end of Period 53. Since 'in-transit' units (427) are high and we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48 to arrive in Periods 49, 50, 51, and 52 respectively, we have sufficient coverage for the remaining periods. I will maintain lead time L=4 and use recent_N (N=10) for demand statistics to reflect the stable 95-100 unit mean observed since Period 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the observed periods, with the average demand for the last 10 periods (P40-P49) being 104.2 units, which is consistent with the long-term mean identified in historical insights (around 95-104 units). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on order arrivals (e.g., P45 order arrived in P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units and in-transit is 421 units (covering orders from P46-P49). Using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) is appropriate as the regime is stable. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability and N=10 for L (though L is consistently 4) to ensure the backend uses the most reliable, observed lead time data. This configuration balances the 80% service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.
