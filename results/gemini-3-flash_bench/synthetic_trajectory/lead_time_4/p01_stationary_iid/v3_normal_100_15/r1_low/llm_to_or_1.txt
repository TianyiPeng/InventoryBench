Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. No historical performance or 'conclude' messages exist yet to evaluate actual lead time or lost shipments. Based on the 5 provided historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), the mean is 106.4 and the standard deviation is 17.5. Since the dates are generic 'Period_X' and there is no product category detail beyond 'chips(Regular)', I will use all available samples (recent_5) to establish the base stock level. The calculation for mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+L)*std, where L is 4. This covers demand during the lead time plus the review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 136 units, which are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (L=4). Demand for Period 1 was 111, which resulted in lost sales since our initial on-hand inventory was 0. Given the high demand in the history (ranging from 88 to 133, with Period 1 being 111), the mean demand across 6 samples (5 historical + P1) is approximately 107.16. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available data points (111, 110, 108, 93, 133, 88). This will help the backend compute the base stock levels using the formula (1+L) * mean. For L, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 4. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. In periods 1 and 2, demand was 111 and 126 units respectively, both of which were lost because starting on-hand inventory was 0 and no arrivals occurred. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 aren't expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Total in-transit is 270 units (136 from P1 + 134 from P2). Historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) average 106.4. Including the live data from P1 (111) and P2 (126), the mean remains around 110. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 will capture the most recent demand fluctuations (samples 3, 4, 5 and observed P1, P2) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not yet arrived (as expected, since L=4 means they arrive during Period 5 and are visible in Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0) because initial inventory was 0 and arrivals haven't started. Demand samples for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data provided in the prompt) are: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110. The mean demand is approximately 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.7. Since we are in the early stages and have no evidence of lead time deviation yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent statistics for this SKU.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 are still in transit (total 530 units). According to the sequence of events, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the zero arrivals seen so far (Periods 1-4) are consistent with the promised lead time of 4. Historical demand mean is 106.4 with a standard deviation of 15.6 over the first 5 samples. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have high backlog/lost sales (sold=0 while demand > 0), the priority is ensuring the pipeline covers the 5-period window (L+1). I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to use all available history, as the demand appears relatively stable (ranging 88-133) and there is no evidence yet of lead time deviation or seasonal shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed in P1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been stable, with a mean of approximately 107 units (111, 126, 90, 124, 85). However, the initial demand samples provided in the prompt (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) differ slightly from the GAME HISTORY demand. Using the history (N=5), the mean is 107.2 and the standard deviation is 18.9. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 (5) periods. mu_hat should target ~536 (5 * 107.2) and sigma_hat should target ~42 (sqrt(5) * 18.9). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both to capture the most relevant demand characteristics. Total in-transit is 411, and on-hand is 51, providing a current pipeline of 462. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5); Demand regime stable around 107 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Reviewing history: Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals matched P1 and P2 orders). Demand remains stable; the mean of all samples (P1-P6) is approximately 104.5 units, while the recent 3-period average is 100 units. The system is now in a steady state where orders are arriving regularly. On-hand inventory is 94 units, and in-transit is 351 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). With a lead time of 4, the OR backend needs parameters to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean and use the default calculation for sigma_hat. Lead time remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical conclusion data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms that actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand remains relatively stable with samples: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123 (mean ~107). Current inventory is 100 on-hand and 300 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). With L=4, the OR backend targets a base stock covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use recent_N to capture the stable demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-59.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1-4 arriving in Periods 5-8. The historical demand (last 8 periods) shows a mean of approximately 104.5 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly lower but stable (123, 86, and 124 in P4 conclude). Currently, there are 145 units on-hand and 305 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Since lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~105, we need ~525 units in the pipeline. Current total (on-hand + in-transit) is 450. The backend will calculate the necessary order based on the lead time of 4. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most stable recent demand profile (avg ~101.8), while standard deviation is calculated over all available samples to capture volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history from Periods 1-9, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Average demand over these 9 periods is 104.7 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging 98.4 units and the first 4 periods averaging 112.75 units. Demand appears stable but fluctuates between 85 and 126. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median of total demand over (L+1) periods. Since L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Currently, pipeline inventory is 347 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9) and on-hand is 55, totaling 402 units. Given a mean of ~105, 5 periods of demand is ~525 units. The current inventory position is slightly low compared to the expected 5-period demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 to capture the full observed distribution while acknowledging the stable regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries from Periods 1 through 6 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 103 units over the last 10 periods (111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123, 86, 107, 88). Current on-hand inventory is 41 with 395 units in transit (expected arrivals from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting a base stock level targeting the median. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full resolved demand history while maintaining the confirmed lead time L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 397 units. Based on conclude messages from P5 to P11, the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand remains stable; the average demand over the first 11 periods is approximately 103.6 units, while the average of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 102 units. The standard deviation is relatively stable around 15-17 units. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed history of this stable regime, and use the default lead time of 4. This will target a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~515 units). With 397 in transit and 13 on-hand (Total 410), the OR backend will order to close the gap to the base stock, ensuring high service levels given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each, implying a 50% critical ratio for z-score but the OR engine logic uses the specific profit/holding cost formula).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains stable within a consistent regime. Analyzing all 12 concluded periods, the mean demand is 103.17 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12). Current inventory status: On-hand is 58, and In-transit is 368. The in-transit units correspond to orders placed in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12 (59+122+80+107 = 368), which are expected to arrive in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 respectively. Since L=4, the base stock should cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the long-term mean (~103) for mu_hat and the long-term standard deviation for sigma_hat provides a robust inventory target for the OR backend, which will then calculate the order based on the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following Period 13, where demand (117) perfectly met the available stock. All shipments to date have arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, with the most recent 10 periods (P4-P13) averaging approximately 102 units, showing no significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (z=0), which the base-stock model manages by setting the base stock level to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Currently, there are 401 units in-transit (Orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). At an average demand of ~102/period, the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover the next 4 periods, but as on-hand is zero, we must maintain consistent parameters to trigger the appropriate replacement order this period. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current stable mean while filtering out the slightly higher variance from the very first few periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation confirms lead time is consistently 4 periods (P10 order arrived P14 as expected). Demand remains stable with no clear evidence of seasonal shifts yet. The mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 104 units, while over the last 7 periods (N=7), it is 103 units. Given Profit = Holding Cost = $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. A base stock policy targeting the median (z=0) is appropriate. Since the pipeline (387) plus on-hand (3) equals 390 units, and the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods is ~515 units, the backend will place an order to bridge this gap. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 104.5 units over the last 15 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 11 arriving exactly in 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a slight stockout in Period 15 (demand 104 vs. start inventory 83). There are 427 units in-transit (orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15), with Period 12's order of 107 units expected to arrive during the current period (Period 16). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=10 captures the most stable recent demand regime to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) while minimizing holding costs.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 5, with recent demand (last 5 periods) averaging 108.2 units, which is consistent with the long-term history. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced minor stockouts in Periods 15 and 16 due to demand slightly exceeding available arrivals. With in-transit inventory at 409 units and an upcoming arrival for Period 17 (ordered in Period 13, qty=92), we need to ensure the order covers the L+1 window. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (representing the stable regime since lead-time stabilized) to provide a robust average demand forecast while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which makes the OR backend target a balanced service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a history of stockouts in Period 15 and Period 17 due to demand exceeding supply and the fixed 4-period lead time. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P13. Demand is relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 109.4 units, slightly higher than the earlier regime. To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 results in a 50% service level target in a standard newsboy, but the OR backend uses profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slight uptick. Since L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. The in-transit inventory is 418 units, which covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods will provide a stable but current mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable with a slight upward trend, averaging 106 units over the last 10 periods (P8-P17). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing periodic stockouts (Period 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 all ended with 0 inventory). While on-hand is 0, there are 410 units in-transit, which aligns with the observed lead time of 4 periods (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Demand has shown a subtle upward shift; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is 106.1 units, compared to the earlier average. Given the high stockout frequency, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime more accurately and ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the recent volatility and slightly higher mean demand. This approach helps recover from the current zero-inventory state as arrivals from P15 onwards Begin hitting in the next period.

Carry-over insight: Recurring stockouts observed from Period 13-18 due to demand consistently meeting or exceeding on-hand inventory; demand mean (P9-P18) is 106.1 (+4% vs initial history).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the system is recovering from a cycle of stockouts between Period 13 and Period 18, where demand frequently exhausted on-hand inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 31 units following an arrival of 120 units and a lower-than-average demand of 89 units in Period 19. The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P9-P19) is approximately 103.6 units, while the mean over the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) is 104.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that ensure 'on-hand + in-transit' covers demand for the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), totaling 5 periods. Given the high stockout risk observed in the recent past and the relatively high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($1.0), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the slightly elevated demand regime while preventing excessive inventory accumulation. I'll select N=11 to balance the recent variance and stabilize the mu_hat forecast.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), with a mean of 104.3 units. Frequent stockouts occurred between Periods 13 and 18 because the safety stock calculation (sigma_hat) was likely too low or the lead time was slightly underestimated, though actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 23 units and a healthy pipeline of 404 units, I need to ensure the base stock levels cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to prevent further stockouts. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and ensure the OR backend has an accurate view of volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P11 to P20 stabilized at 104.3 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104-106 units per period. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is 105.1 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 9.9. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. While there were stockouts from P13-P18, the system has recovered recently with positive ending inventory in P19-P21. However, current on-hand inventory is low (10 units), necessitating a focused replenishment strategy. To ensure the OR backend captures this stable but slightly elevated demand compared to the very early history, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current regime while maintaining a 4-period lead time parameter.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the current on-hand inventory is 50 units with 421 units in transit. Historical analysis confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P18). Recent demand has shown some volatility but remains centered around a mean of approximately 103 units. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is 102.7 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the previous window (P9-P18 at 106.1) primarily due to a low demand of 60 in P22. To prevent the stockouts witnessed between P13 and P18, I am maintaining parameters that cover a 5-period window (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and volatility while smoothing out the outlier in P22. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the OR backend uses the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the product chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 74 units and a pipeline (in-transit) of 344 units. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P23 arrival was from P19, 4 periods). Demand remains stable with some recovery from recent stockouts. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is approximately 101 units, while the mean over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 91.4, though P22 had a notable low of 60. Given the high pipeline inventory relative to the target stock levels (roughly 100-110 units per period over L+1 periods), a smaller recent window is appropriate to avoid over-ordering during a slight demand dip (P22-P23). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand volatility and central tendency, while maintaining L at calculate to reflect the stable lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of 105.7 units over the last 15 periods (P10-P24). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 301 units, composed of orders from P21 (100), P22 (118), P23 (44), and P24 (39). The stockout issues observed between P13-P18 have been resolved by adjusting the order parameters to account for the slightly higher demand mean compared to the initial history. I will continue using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out older variance. This window size (N=10) covers the period from P15 to P24, reflecting the most recent stabilized behavior. The backend will calculate base stock using these parameters and the promised lead time of 4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P16-P25) shows an average of 98.4 units per period, which is slightly lower than the long-term average (103.4) and the previously noted period of instability/stockouts. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P21-P25) have an average demand of 93.8 units. The lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods. With 58 units on hand and 328 in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. We use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime while smoothing out outliers like the 60 in Period 22. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=10) to reflect current volatility accurately. L is set to calculate as it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 21: average demand decreased to approximately 94-98 units/period from the previous 106 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-26) has shown a sustained decrease. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 88.8 units (89, 84, 114, 60, 97, 109 previously, with 89 and 84 being the most recent), confirming the downward shift noted in the previous carry-over insight. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and the associated variability. The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22 order arrived in P26). With an on-hand inventory of 92 and in-transit of 317, the pipeline is relatively full compared to the new lower demand level, so the OR backend will likely order less to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level consistent with equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history starting from Period 21 shows a shift in both mean and volatility compared to earlier periods. Specifically, the mean demand from P21-P27 is 95.7 units/period, compared to the previous ~106 units. However, Period 27 saw a significant spike (134 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is tight with only 2 units on-hand and 325 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27 are expected). To respond to the recent drop but account for the latest spike, I will use a recent window (N=7) for both demand mean and standard deviation. This N captures the current regime while allowing the recent volatility and high demand in P27 to influence the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21-27 averaged 95.7 units/period with increased volatility (StdDev ~22), a decrease from the previous ~106 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21-28) has shown a shift in behavior. Mean demand is approximately 98.4 units per period (sum of last 8 demands: 114, 60, 97, 109, 89, 84, 134, 102 = 787 / 8 = 98.375). Volatility has increased significantly, evidenced by recent fluctuations ranging from 60 to 134. Period 28 concluded with a stockout (on-hand: 0) because the arrival from Period 24 was only 39 units, failing to meet the demand of 102 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P24 order arrived P28). I will set L to 'calculate' (which has consistently yielded 4) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower mean but higher volatility regime, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the increased uncertainty and prevents further stockouts while adjusting to the current average demand level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime Period 21-28: mean ~98.4 units/period with significantly higher volatility (range 60-134) compared to previous periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 29, the average demand is approximately 98.4 units per period (Sum of P21-P29: 114, 60, 97, 109, 89, 84, 134, 102, 85 = 874 / 9 = 97.1). This period also exhibits higher volatility (standard deviation ~20-22) compared to the initial regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume, higher volatility regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (42) due to a stockout in Period 28, but in-transit inventory is high (367), meaning the system is currently over-corrected or catching up. The backend cap will prevent excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime Period 21-29: mean ~97.1 units/period with increased volatility compared to Periods 1-20.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21-30) shows a mean of 97.55 units/period with significantly higher volatility (StdDev \u2248 20.3) compared to earlier periods. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 67, and there is a total pipeline of 337 units (orders from P27-P30). Since we are in a lower-demand but higher-volatility environment, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition and the increased variance. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the consistently observed historical lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 21-30 confirmed: mean ~97.6 units/period with increased volatility (StdDev ~20.3). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the first 20 periods. Specifically, demand from Period 21 to Period 31 has an average of 95.8 units/period. While there was a spike in Period 27 (134 units), the general trend is lower and more volatile (StdDev approximately 19.5 for this segment). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Current on-hand inventory is low (22), but the pipeline is substantial (359 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 28-31 to recover from the P28 stockout. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current regime's lower mean and higher volatility, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock to these new parameters while managing the significant in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains characteristically stable but with noticeable volatility since Period 21. For the period range P21-P32 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 97.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. This is a clear shift from the earlier periods (P1-P20) where demand was slightly higher (~105). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all concluded orders. The current on-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit inventory is 319 (consisting of orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32). Total pipeline inventory is 372. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using the recent 12-sample regime (P21-P32) provides the most accurate forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current volatility and mean while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 96.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of 18.9. In the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean is 99.4, suggesting we should focus on recent data to capture any slight upward drift or sustained volatility. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33 as expected). Current on-hand inventory is 34 units, with 361 units in-transit. To balance high service levels against equal unit profit and holding costs ($1 each), I will use the recent 10 periods for both demand mean and volatility estimation (N=10), accounting for the recent regime shift better than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21-33 has stabilized with a mean of ~96 units and significant volatility (StdDev ~19). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current on-hand inventory is 0 because the starting inventory of 111 in Period 34 was fully depleted by a demand of 127. The in-transit inventory is 378 units, consisting of orders from Periods 31-34. An arrival of 74 units (ordered in Period 31) is expected during Period 35's arrival phase, which is roughly aligned with the current mean demand. Analysis of the demand regime desde Period 21 indicates a stable mean of approximately 96.6 units (calculated from P21-P34) with a significant increase in volatility (standard deviation approximately 19.3). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Since the current demand pattern has been stable for 14 periods, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this regime's mean and variance precisely for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both the lower average and the higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 21-34 confirmed: mean ~96.6 units/period, StdDev ~19.3. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21-35) is confirmed to have a mean of approximately 96.4 units/period with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~19.5). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The inventory is currently at 0 due to two consecutive periods of stockouts (P34 and P35), where demand (127 and 93) exceeded the arriving units (77 and 74). In-transit inventory (ordered P32-P35) totals 418 units. To stabilize service levels given the high volatility and current stockout state, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this specific demand regime (approx P21-P35). This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time + review period demand including a safety stock buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has shown a mean of approximately 96-98 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~20). Period 36 concluded with zero on-hand inventory and a stockout (112 demand vs 98 available), following a similar stockout in Period 35. Total in-transit inventory is 392 units, which includes orders from Periods 33, 34, 35, and 36 (112, 94, 114, 72). The Period 33 order of 112 units is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 37, given the consistent lead time of 4 periods observed throughout the history. To address the recent stockouts and high volatility, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=16, covering the regime since P21) and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockouts occurred in Periods 34, 35, and 36 because arrival quantities were insufficient to cover demand spikes (127, 93, 112 demand). Demand regime since P21 confirmed: mean ~97.3, StdDev ~19.8.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 96-98 units and a standard deviation of about 20. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In the most recent periods (P34-P36), we experienced stockouts because arrivals (ordered around Period 30) were insufficient to meet demand spikes of 110-127 units. The current on-hand inventory is 31, with 383 units in transit. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~97.5, the required base stock is around 487 units. Our total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 31 + 383 = 414. We are below the target level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the regime starting from Period 21 to the present (Period 37), and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been a reliable 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21-38) shows a mean of approximately 97 units with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~20) than the initial history. This volatility led to multiple stockouts in Periods 34-36. I will use recent_N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but volatile regime since Period 21. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by Period 38's arrival of the Period 34 order. On-hand inventory is currently low (32), while in-transit (364) is healthy. The OR backend needs parameters that account for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the stockout risk seen in late Period 30s against the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime from P21-P38 remains stable at mean ~97.0 with sustained higher volatility (StdDev ~20). Lead time continues to be reliable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 97.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 20.0. Current inventory analysis: On-hand is 32, and In-transit is 342. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to maintain a service level balance where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5). Given the stable but more volatile regime observed over the last 19 periods (P21-P39), I am using N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using lead time 'calculate' to leverage the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 97 units and a standard deviation of about 20. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, and there are 388 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 37-40). I will use the 'recent_N' method for all parameters, focusing on the stable regime since Period 21. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), N=20 is chosen to cover the data from Period 21 to Period 40. For lead time (L), 'default' is selected because the backend promised lead time matches the actual observed lead time of 4 periods consistently.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 21. For the current decision at Period 42, the background observation covers periods up to P41. Analyzing the most recent demand from P21 to P41, the mean is approximately 96.6 units per period. Although the earlier carry-over insights noted high volatility (StdDev ~20), the most recent few periods (P37-P41) have shown a slight softening of demand (81, 93, 114, 82, 61), bringing the recent average down. However, for mu_hat, a 20-period lookback (N=21) captures the full extent of this stabilized regime while smoothing out the noise from the high-volatility spikes seen in the P20s and P30s. The lead time is confirmed and exceptionally stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 363 units plus 64 on-hand covers more than 4 periods of average demand, suggesting the system is well-stocked and the OR cap will likely moderate new orders to prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). I will use recent_N with N=21 to capture the steady-state mean and sigma since the last major regime shift identified at P21.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21 onwards) remains stable with a mean of approximately 97 units and a standard deviation of about 19.8. From Period 37 to 42, demand has been slightly lower (avg ~84), but this fits within the high volatility observed since P21. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 8 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain service levels without overstocking towards the end. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the 'base_stock' will naturally gravitate towards the mean. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=22, covering the regime since P21) and sigma_hat using recent_N ensures the OR backend captures this sustained volatility while centering on the regime mean. On-hand + In-transit (383 units) is healthy relative to the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods (approx 485 units), necessitating a moderate order to buffer against potential demand spikes similar to those that caused stockouts in P34-P36.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has been characterized by a mean of approximately 95-98 units with significant volatility. Analysis of the most recent 20 periods (P24-P43) shows a mean demand of 95.5 units and a standard deviation of 16.7. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. Current inventory position is 32 on-hand + 346 in-transit = 378 total. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is q = 0.5. However, due to previous stockouts caused by demand spikes (e.g., P27, P34), maintaining a slightly higher safety stock via standard deviation estimates is prudent. I will use the recent N=20 period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has remained relatively stable but more volatile than the initial history. Over the last 13 periods (P32-P44), the mean demand is approximately 98.4 units per period with a standard deviation of about 17.5. The most recent demand (P44) was 108. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing excess inventory at the end. Current on-hand is 42 and in-transit is 335 (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Based on the mean of ~98, the pipeline covers about 3.4 periods of demand. I will use the established recent demand mean and volatility to set parameters, ensuring enough stock arrives for the final periods without over-ordering.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistently stable since the last identified changepoint at Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 45 (25 periods), the mean demand is approximately 96.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3. There is no evidence of a seasonal shift or lead-time deviation (lead time is consistently 4 periods). On-hand inventory is currently low (29 units) but there is a significant in-transit pipeline (367 units) that covers the next 4 periods of expected demand (approx 386 units total requirement for L+1). To maintain the current service level while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=25 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 21. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 96-98 units and a standard deviation around 20. In the most recent periods (P41-P46), demand has averaged 91.8, while the average from P21 to P46 is 95.8. The current status shows 0 units on-hand with 400 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). The order from Period 43 (97 units) is expected to arrive during Period 47, which will be the only inventory available to satisfy Period 47 demand. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 47 of 50), I will maintain the current regime parameters to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 4 periods. Setting N=26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the stable period from P21 to P46. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the game history (confirmed again by the P43 order arriving in P47). Demand has stabilized in a regime starting around Period 21. From P21 to P47, the mean demand is approximately 97.4 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P38-P47) is slightly higher at 93.9 but consistent with the overall regime. Since there are only 3 periods remaining in the game (48, 49, 50), and the current lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, the priority is to manage current on-hand and in-transit inventory to satisfy demand for the final 3 periods. With 8 units on hand and 387 units in transit (specifically, orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 are expected to arrive in P48, P49, P50, and beyond), we have sufficient inventory to cover the remaining periods. I will maintain the current demand parameters using the regime since P21 (N=27) to ensure the OR engine maintains a stable base stock level.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the stable pattern established around Period 21. For the current decision at Period 49, I analyze the demand from Period 21 to Period 48. The mean demand in this period (N=28) is approximately 96.6 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Although the recent mean is slightly lower than the initial history, the volatility remains higher. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 10 units and pipeline inventory is 367 units (orders from P45, P46, P47, and P48). Given we are at the penultimate period (P49), the order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 54 (4 periods lead time), which is beyond the game end. However, the OR backend requires parameters to function. I will use the established regime (N=28) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the consistent demand and volatility seen in the second half of the game. L is set to default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stabilized regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 49, the mean demand is approximately 96.6 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 16.5. Despite some historical volatility and stockouts around Period 34-36, the last 10 periods (P40-P49) show a consistent mean of 95.9 units. The lead time has remained very stable at exactly 4 periodsThroughout the entire game. Currently, we have 8 units on-hand and 364 units in-transit. The OR backend will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) to capture this stabilized regime (N=29 covering Periods 21-49). A lead time of 4 periods with 1 review period means the base stock target will cover 5 periods of demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the backend will aim for a 50% service level by default (z*=0), but the standard 'cap' logic in the engine provides additional safety to prevent major stockouts. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is accurate.
