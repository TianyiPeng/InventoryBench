Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4. Without historical data beyond the basic samples provided for P1-P5 (mean: 91.8, std: 17.5), I will use the 'default' methods for the OR backend to establish a baseline. Since internal logic for base stock is (1+L) * mean, and L sequence is P1-P5, I will treat the first few periods as a discovery phase for actual lead time behavior. Demand samples show a relatively stable mean around 90 units per period. I'll use default configurations as we have no 'conclude' messages to infer lead-time drift or lost shipments yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 118 units, and faced a demand of 108. Since the arrival happens after the order decision, we sold 0 units and have 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 118. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we do not expect the order from P1 to arrive until P5 (visible in P6). Therefore, we must plan for a 5-period window (L+1). Historical demand samples (P1-P5) show a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Given the high stockout risk (held inventory is 0), and the fact that we won't see stock for several periods, I will use the full history to establish a baseline. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, which the OR backend will execute. I will follow the default lead time (4) and use all available historical samples (5) to estimate demand and volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, it is expected that no orders placed in Periods 1 or 2 (which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 5 and 6 respectively) have arrived yet. Consequently, we have experienced 100% stockouts due to starting with 0 inventory and having a 4-period lead time. Demand samples provide the following sequence: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 (pre-game) and 108, 124 (Periods 1-2). The mean demand over these 7 samples is approximately 97.28. Given the high stockout risk early in the game and the unit profit equaling the holding cost (implying a 50% target service level in the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~102) compared to the initial samples. I will stick to the default promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have reached their expected arrival date yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 373 units in-transit). In accordance with the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the current 'arrived=0' observations for Periods 1-3 are expected and do not indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Demand for the first three periods was 108, 124, and 85 (mean \u2248 105.7). Using all available samples (N=3) is appropriate as no regime shift is detected. I will set parameters to cover the (L+1) window, providing the OR backend with the necessary statistics for the base-stock calculation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history shows orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 1+4=5 and be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which we will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-4 are expected. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but a large pipeline (511 units) is in transit. Demand over the first 5 periods (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) shows a mean of approximately 89.8 with moderate variance. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available samples to establish a baseline forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand for the first 5 periods has been [108, 124, 85, 79, 100], resulting in a historical mean of 99.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The current on-hand inventory is 18, with 393 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the L=4, we expect the order from Period 2 to arrive in Period 6. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while the lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 99 units (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Currently, we have 42 units on hand and 356 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Expected demand coverage needs to account for (L+1) periods, which is 5 periods. With a mean demand of ~99, we need total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) to be around 495 units. The current total is 398 units (42 + 356), suggesting the OR backend needs to place an order. I am using 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the confirmed 4-period lead time, and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu and sigma to capture the full stable history since start, as no regime shift is yet detected.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals from orders placed in Period 1, 2, and 3. The current on-hand inventory is 53, with 320 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7; Period 5 had 0 ordered). Demand over the last 7 periods (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122) averages 102.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. There is no clear seasonal shift yet, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full active history since start. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the stable 4-period observations. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-4). Demand has slightly increased from the first four periods (mean ~99) to the last four periods (mean ~110). Specifically, the last three periods (P6-P8) have shown demand values of 98, 122, and 121, suggesting a slightly higher and more volatile demand regime than the initial samples. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the base stock to align closely with the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility while maintaining the L value as the promised/observed 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory was depleted (0 ending inventory) and customer demand was 145, exceeding the 121 seen in Period 8. The stockout occurred because no order arrived in Period 9 (as expected, since no order was placed in Period 5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P1-P4). The demand pattern shows a recent increase (P7: 122, P8: 121, P9: 145), suggesting the mean has shifted upwards from the early samples (average ~90-100). The current in-transit inventory is 449 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Given the stockout and the rising demand trend, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand mean (avg ~117) and variance. Lead time is set to default as the confirmed 4-period lead time matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~95 to ~129 (+35%) across the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages, we see a consistent lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). The order from Period 5 (ordered 0) resulted in no arrival in P9, which led to a stockout. Period 10 also ended in a stockout because demand (115) exceeded the arrival (85). As noted in previous insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 7. Demand for P7-P10 was 122, 121, 145, and 115 respectively, averaging 125.75. This is significantly higher than the P1-P6 average of ~99. To address this, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using L=4 (promised and confirmed) and N=4 for demand statistics will set a base stock level covering (4+1)=5 periods of this higher demand regime, helping to recover from the current zero on-hand inventory position and mitigate future stockouts while pipeline inventory (501 units) balances out.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as evidenced by arrivals from orders placed in Period 6 and 7 arriving in Periods 10 and 11 respectively. We observed a demand regime shift around Period 7. Historically, demand was ~92 units (P1-P5), but shifted upwards. However, the last few periods (P9-P11) show demand of 145, 115, and 89. This calculates to a mean of 116 over these 3 periods (down from the 129 average noted in the P10 insight). Given the volatility (demand dropped to 89 in P11), I am using N=5 for the demand mean to smooth out the recent drop while still acknowledging the structurally higher demand compared to the start of the game. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), emphasizing the need for robust base stock levels to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current state shows on-hand inventory of 37 units with 453 units in-transit. Based on historical data from Period 5 onwards (excluding Period 5's manual order of 0), lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (arrived: P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). Order placed in P9 is expected to arrive during P13 resolution. Demand analysis: Early demand (P1-P6) averaged 99 units. Starting from P7, demand showed a temporary spike (P7: 122, P8: 121, P9: 145) but has recently moderated (P10: 115, P11: 89, P12: 102). The average of the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is 115.6, which represents the current regime better than the long-term mean. I will set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and mean shift while maintaining a 4-period lead time assumption. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.5; the OR backend will calculate the base stock accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by orders from Periods 1-4 and 6-9). Demand has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift was noted at Period 10, the most recent three periods (P11-P13) show a cooling of demand (89, 102, 73) compared to the spike in P7-P10. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is approximately 109.8, which is closer to the long-term mean than the previously identified spike. Given the high stockout risk seen in P9-P10 and the current on-hand inventory of 100 with a large pipeline (406), I will use a recent window for demand (N=7) to capture the current stabilization. This balances the initial spike with the recent dip. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 ensures the OR backend captures the increased variance and the moderate mean of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; the spike observed in P7-P10 has moderated in P11-P13, leading to a revised average demand of ~110 over the last 7 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals from P5 through P14). Demand has shown significant fluctuations: an initial regime of ~99 (P1-P6), a spike to ~129 (P7-P10), and a recent cooling to ~82 (P11-P14). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P7-P14) is approximately 104, which balances the high and low volatility observed recently. Given the inventory context (174 on-hand and 311 in-transit), the system is well-covered for the current (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized shift in demand patterns while smoothing the abrupt drop seen in the last two periods. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed: Period 11-14 average demand dropped to 81.75 compared to the P7-P10 average of 125.75, confirming a shift back towards baseline levels.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 11 order. Recent demand has been volatile: Period 15 saw a sharp spike (142 units) following several lower records (89, 102, 73, 63). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is 93.8 units, while the mean over the most recent 10 periods (covering both the high regime and recent dip) is 105.5. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use the last 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this variability without overreacting to the single low or high points. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. On-hand inventory is 160 with 217 in transit, suggesting a healthy pipeline against the expected demand mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we analyze the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The recent demand history reflects high volatility, with a cooling period (P11-P14 avg ~82) followed by a sharp increase in P15 (142) and P16 (108). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is approximately 96.2, which aligns closely with the initial baseline. Lead time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat properly captures the return from the cooling phase to a more normal demand level while accounting for the recent spikes. Given the current high volatility (std dev remains significant), I will use recent_N with N=10 for sigma_hat to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer. No shipments are currently perceived as lost as they are arriving consistently with a 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. Following a high-demand phase (P7-P10, avg ~125), demand cooled significantly (P11-P14, avg ~82). However, the most recent three periods (P15-P17) have seen a resurgence in demand, with values of 142, 108, and 148, averaging 132.7. This suggests a transition back to a high-demand regime or a cyclical peak. The delivery lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 45 units on hand and a high pipeline of 288 units (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17), we must ensure parameters reflect the recent upward trend to maintain a high service level without over-ordering as large past orders arrive. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to capture this latest spike. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=7) is used to balance the extreme volatility seen across the cooling and peaking phases.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike detected: Period 15-17 average demand increased to 132.7 units, reversing the cooling trend seen in P11-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory is currently 0 units on-hand with 432 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 15, with demand increasing to an average of 132.7 units in Periods 15-17. Period 18 saw demand of 109, though sales were capped by available stock. The last 4 periods (15-18) yield an average demand of 126.75. To capture this recent spike and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4. Volatility has also been relatively high during this period, so I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for recent variance. This should help recover from the current stockout and meet the higher demand levels while managing the holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained: Period 15-18 average demand is 126.75, confirming the high-demand regime compared to the Period 11-14 average of 81.75.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the system is recovering from stockouts in Periods 18 and 19. Historical data confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods is stable. Demand has been highly volatile: a spike was observed in Period 15-18 (avg ~127), but Period 19 saw a sharp drop to 62. Due to on-hand inventory being 0 and a large pipeline (560 units) including orders from Period 16 (152 units) and Period 18 (186 units), the OR backend must balance the high demand seen recently against current stockouts. Setting N=5 for demand (Period 15-19) captures the recent spike and the most recent dip (avg ~114), which is more representative of the current 'high-volatility' regime than the long-term average. Sigma is also calculated over N=5 to account for this increased volatility (std dev ~35.5). Using L=4 (default) as it matches observed performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with alternating spikes and dips. Over the last 6 periods (P15-P20), the average demand is approximately 111.8 units, which is higher than the initial baseline but shows a recent moderation in Period 19 (62 units) and Period 20 (102 units). The current on-hand inventory is 50, and the pipeline inventory is 417 units (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat approx 112 per period) and its variance. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent high-demand environment while accounting for the significant spread in consumption rates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 22. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages (P17 arrived P21). Demand has been volatile but shows a sustained high-regime characteristic in the recent window. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P15-P21), demand values are [142, 108, 148, 109, 62, 102, 107]. The average of these 7 periods is 108.3 units. While P18-P19 saw stockouts limiting 'sold' units, the actual 'demand' was recorded. The spike noted in carry-over insights at P18 seems to have moderated slightly but remains higher than the P11-P14 cooling period (avg 81.75). I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture this recent higher-than-baseline demand level while accounting for the lower P19 demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the current high volatility (standard deviation of ~27). With on-hand at 3 and in-transit at 450 (covering future arrivals from P18-P21 orders: 186, 162, 9, 93), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the (L+1) base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization: Period 15-21 average demand is 108.3, confirming a higher baseline than the P11-P14 dip (81.75) but lower than the P7-P10 peak (125.75).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the Period 18 order (186 units) arriving exactly in Period 22 as expected. Demand has stabilized over the most recent 8 periods (P15-P22) with a mean of 110.3 and a standard deviation of 27.5. This follows a high-volatility period with spikes and dips. The system currently has 84 units on hand and 367 units in transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22 totaling 162+9+93+103=367). With the promised lead time L=4, the OR backend logic will target coverage for 5 periods (L+1). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters with N=8 to capture this most recent stabilized regime, ensuring our base stock level accounts for the current demand mean of ~110 while protecting against the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 20-23) shows stabilization around 105 units (102, 107, 105, 107). This contradicts the earlier volatility and suggests a return to a consistent baseline near the 'stabilization' insight identified in Period 22. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, verified by the arrival of the Order from Period 19 in Period 23 (23 - 19 = 4). With on-hand inventory at 139 and in-transit units at 306 (primarily from orders in P20-P23), the pipeline check shows we are well-positioned. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current stable regime while recent_N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) provides a slightly wider window to account for the preceding fluctuations without overreacting to older, higher spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 20-23 demand is highly consistent at an average of 105.25 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). The inventory position shows 44 units on-hand and 379 units in-transit, which includes recently placed orders that are expected to arrive sequentially. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. Since the demand has shown a steady, non-volatile regime for over 5 periods, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stability. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods and the observed arrivals.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) with a mean of approximately 108.3 units. While P25 saw a slight uptick to 125, the overall regime remains consistent with the stabilization noted in Carry-Over Insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the order from P21 arriving in P25. Current on-hand inventory is low (12 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 388 units (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25) which are expected to arrive in successive periods. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I am using a recent window of N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime (excluding the highly volatile earlier periods), and setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically consistent 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed: Period 20-25 average demand is 108.3 units, maintaining a consistent baseline since the high-volatility period around P15-P19.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), yielding an average demand of approximately 104.3 units. While P26 showed a lower demand (80), it follows a higher demand in P25 (125), suggesting continued moderate volatility around the established mean. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P22. Currently, there is 35 units on-hand and 408 units in transit. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 443) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.25 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend will target a 50% service level (the median). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 will capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~104.3), and using the same N for sigma_hat will appropriately reflect the recent variance without overreacting to the P15-P19 spike.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P20-P27) around a mean of 105.6. While individual periods show typical volatility (ranging from 80 to 125 recently), there is no sustained evidence of a new shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P23 order in P27. The current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), but the in-transit pipeline is very healthy (386 units), covering roughly 3.6 periods of average demand. To maintain the service level effectively while the system handles arrivals from P24-P27, I will use a recent window of N=8 for demand parameters (covering the stabilized regime since P20) and stick with the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a stable but slightly volatile regime. Over the last 9 periods (P20-P28), the average demand is 108.5 units. The most recent demand (P28) was 132, an increase from the previous average. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 426 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we want the inventory to cover the median demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~108.5) and N=9 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (standard deviation ~15.2). This ensures that base stock levels are responsive to the current trend while maintaining sufficient pipeline cover for the 4-period lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 106 units over the last 10 periods (P20-P29). Recent demand observations are P25: 125, P26: 80, P27: 115, P28: 132, P29: 98, which supports this average despite some local volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the most recent arrival in Period 29 (ordered P25). Current on-hand inventory is low at 4 units, but significant in-transit stock (441 units) exists. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. For lead time, 'default' is appropriate as it correctly aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. Calculating the average demand from Period 21 to Period 30, we find a mean of approximately 106.0 units per period (107, 105, 107, 104, 125, 80, 115, 132, 98, 87). The standard deviation in this same recent window (N=10) is approximately 16.5, which is lower than the long-term volatility but reflects recent fluctuations like the spike in Period 28. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals recorded in history since Period 5, including the arrival in Period 30. Therefore, I will use L=4 (promised/actual), mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture this stable-but-elevated baseline, and sigma_hat also based on the last 10 periods to ensure the inventory buffer is tight but sufficient for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed: Period 21-30 average demand is 106.0 units with a standard deviation of 16.5, maintaining the baseline established around Period 20.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 106 units per period since roughly Period 20, as noted in the carry-over insights and confirmed by the Period 21-30 average. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 411 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand in Period 31 (145 units), and the fact that we have run out of stock despite arrivals, I will maintain the baseline demand profile but ensure the OR backend uses the recently stabilized data. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime (Periods 20-31) while ignoring the older high-volatility spikes. L=4 is well-established.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-32) shows a stable baseline with a mean of approximately 109 units (1308/12), though recent volatility includes spikes (145 in P31) and dips (87 in P30). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals observed in history. At Period 33, we have 11 units on-hand and 423 units in transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Pipeline inventory is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this stabilized demand regime (P21-P32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend accounts for the current mean (~109) and the observed variance during this period. Method for L remains 'default' (4 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a baseline of ~108 units since Period 20. The most recent demand samples (P31-P33: 145, 111, 105; average 120) show a slight increase but are consistent with the established volatility (standard deviation ~16-20). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 23 units and high in-transit quantities, the OR backend needs to maintain the current base stock level to cover the lead time + current period (L+1=5 periods). I am using recent_N=14 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 20 while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This balances the service level against the $1.0 holding cost.

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of ~108 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 20). The standard deviation remains consistent around 16. The lead time is confirmed at a reliable 4 periods, with the Period 30 order arriving as expected in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is low (18 units), but in-transit inventory (428 units) is significant, representing a robust pipeline. I will continue using a 14-period lookback (recent_N=14) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out older, more volatile data. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1) without over-reacting to minor fluctuations, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin which suggests a target service level of approximately 50%.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of ~106 units since Period 20. The most recent demand samples (P31-P35: 145, 111, 105, 98, 107) yield an average of 113.2, slightly above the long-term baseline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods per historical arrivals (most recently P31 order arriving in P35). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 446 units in-transit. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering Period 21 to 35) to capture the stabilized regime while filtering out the high-volatility spikes of the earlier periods. This provides a robust estimate of the current demand profile while accounting for the 4-period lead time (L=4 implies covering 5 periods of demand).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 105-110 units since Period 20. Specifically, looking at the last 15 periods (P21-P36), the mean demand is approximately 108 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Current inventory is low (on-hand = 11), but there is a significant amount in-transit (408 units) which represents a roughly 4-period supply (pipeline). I will set L to 4 (promised and recently observed), mu_hat using recent_15 samples to capture the stable regime (108 * 5 = 540), and sigma_hat using recent_15 samples to account for current volatility levels.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 20, with a long-term average around 106-108 units. Recent demand (P31-P37) shows an average of 109 units with moderate volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 43, and in-transit is 422 (covering orders from P34-P37). Total pipeline (465) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.3 periods of demand at the current rate. To maintain the service level effectively while accounting for the stable but slightly higher recent average, I will use a recent_N window of 14 periods (P24-P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime and ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) exposure window.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 105-110 units since Period 20. The most recent demand (P31-P38) averages 110.25 units with a standard deviation of 17.7. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. In-transit inventory (398 units) plus on-hand (33 units) totaling 431 units covers approximately 3.9 periods of demand (at a rate of 110/period), which is nearly aligned with the required coverage for a lead time of 4. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock target will be the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=18, covering the stable period since P21) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=18) to reflect the current baseline accurately while dampening older high-volatility spikes.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable and consistent since approximately Period 20, with a long-term average near 106 units. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 111.2 with a standard deviation of 17.6. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on history. With an on-hand inventory of 37 and a large pipeline of 410 units (representing roughly 4 periods of future demand coverage), the goal is to maintain this stable base stock level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while filtering out older volatility from earlier periods. This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a service level that balances the unit profit against the unit holding cost (which are equal in this case, suggesting a 50% target service level for base stock, though the backend policy uses the provided z*).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the long term. Since Period 31, the demand has hovered around a mean of 106 units. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is 107.8 with a standard deviation of 17.5. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of P40 where the P36 order arrived). Currently, there is 42 on-hand and 398 in-transit. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), effectively a base stock of (L+1) * mu. To maintain the established demand baseline and ensure the OR backend utilizes the most stable recent data, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 21, though the most recent period (P41) showed a significant drop to 64 units. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 99.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 107 and in-transit at 362 (covering orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41), the total pipeline is 469 units. This covers roughly 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable regime while acknowledging the recent dip in volatility, ensuring we don't over-order if the P41 drop persists.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a softening trend over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), with an average demand of 90.9 units compared to the previous stable baseline of ~106. Most recently, P41 and P42 showed significant drops to 64 and 65 units respectively. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level. However, to avoid excessive inventory buildup while demand is cooling, and considering the lead time of 4 periods (making the relevant horizon 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this recent cooling trend without being overly reactive to the very last two points. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Period 33-42 average demand dropped to 90.9 units (from previous baseline of ~106), with a notable dip to ~65 in the most recent two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-103.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly entered a cooling phase since Period 41. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P41-P43) is approximately 63.7 units, significantly lower than the previous baseline of ~106. The carry-over insight from P43 corroborates this cooling trend across the last 10 periods (avg 90.9). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am reducing mu_hat by focusing on the most recent 11 samples (P33-P43), which captures the transition and current low state. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions. On-hand inventory is currently high (165) due to the sudden demand drop, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities as pipeline inventory + on-hand exceeds the new lower base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-113.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained cooling phase beginning around Period 37-41. While the average from Period 33-42 was ~91, the most recent four periods (P41-P44) show even lower demand levels of 64, 65, 62, and 68 (average 64.75). This is a significant drop from the previous long-term baseline of ~106. Consequently, I am using a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility (standard deviation is currently very low). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand and in-transit inventory are currently high (total 387 units) relative to this new demand forecast, so the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities as pipeline inventory outweighs the new base stock targets.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensified at Period 41: Average demand for Period 41-44 is 64.75 units, a 40% decrease from the Period 21-30 baseline of 106.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown recent volatility. After a significant cooling period (P41-P44 average ~65), Period 45 saw a sudden spike to 116 units. However, the overall trend since Period 41 suggests a lower mean than the long-term history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 158 units with 113 units in-transit (orders from P42-P44). Given that the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. With 158 units on hand and a recent average demand of approximately 75-80 units per period, the existing stock plus arrivals should comfortably cover demand for the remaining 5 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent cooling while acknowledging the P45 spike, and use default for L and sigma_hat to maintain standard safety buffers.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a significant cooling period. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P41-P46) is 76.0 units, which is a clear departure from the historical baseline of 106.0 units. Although P45 saw a brief spike to 116 units, P46 returned to 81 units, suggesting the lower trajectory is largely sustained. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this new average while allowing for the volatility observed in P45. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P41-P42 orders arriving on time in P45-P46). Inventory levels (on-hand + in-transit) are currently quite healthy at 294 units against an expected 5-period demand (L+1) of roughly 380 units, but with recent cooling, we must be careful not to over-order. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen during the recent shift.

Carry-over insight: New demand baseline established: Period 41-46 average demand is 76.0 units, down from the previous long-term average of 106.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower baseline after the cooling period identified between Periods 41-44. While recent demand spiked in Period 47 (127 units), the average over the last 7 periods (P41-P47) is approximately 83.3 units. Given the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), the primary focus is to fulfill remaining demand without overstocking, as holding cost equals profit ($1.0). The lead time remains constant at 4 periods, meaning any order placed now will arrive in Period 52 (outside the game horizon). Therefore, the 'In-transit' inventory of 237 units, which will arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50, is more than sufficient to cover expected demand (~83/period \xd7 3 periods = 249) when combined with the 16 units on-hand. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and rely on existing 'calculate' for lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the end of the simulation (Game History ending at Period 50). The 'Period 48 conclude' message shows that the order of 47 units from Period 44 arrived, and on-hand inventory was fully depleted to 0 after satisfying 63 units of demand (from 83 total). The carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 41-48) show a lower demand baseline of approximately 76-80 units, but with significant volatility (highs of 127, lows of 62). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since this is the penultimate decision period (Period 49), the OR backend needs to account for the current pipeline (318 units in-transit) against the expected demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the current regime since P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the reduced but volatile demand pattern, and 'calculate' for L. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a lower service level (~50%), which is appropriate given the current high pipeline relative to the new demand baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility but remains within a established average range of approximately 95-100 units despite recent fluctuations. We are currently facing a temporary stockout at Period 50 due to an arrival of 0 units in Period 49 (which was the expected window for the P45 order). In-transit inventory is high (417 units), representing the orders placed from Periods 46 to 49. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward a base stock target near the median of predicted demand. To stabilize against the recent demand swings (81, 127, 83, 135) and effectively manage the current pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_10 to capture the current mean (~94.3) while using a longer sigma window (recent_20) to capture the true underlying volatility and prevent excessive ordering during temporary spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
