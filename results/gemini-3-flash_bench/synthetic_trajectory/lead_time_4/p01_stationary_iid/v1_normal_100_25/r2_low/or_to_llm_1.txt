It uses the promised lead time (L=4) and tries to maintain a base stock for L+1 (5) periods. \n5. Adjustment: Because we have zero on-hand and the lead time is long (4 periods), we must consistently order to fill the pipeline. The OR recommendation of 115 units is slightly higher than the average demand (90), which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), resulting in a lower critical fractile (0.5), but the capping mechanism prevents over-ordering.

Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 233 units (118 from P1, 115 from P2). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 100, 69, 92, 77, 111. Recent realized demand (concluded rounds) was 89 (P1) and 98 (P2). The average demand is roughly 90-100 units/period. 4. Strategy: We are currently stocking out because the lead time is long (4 periods) and the game just started. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 periods) using on-hand + in-transit + current order. Total demand for 5 periods @ ~95 units = 475. Total currently committed (In-transit) = 233. Required order = 475 - 233 = 242. 5. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 115, which is its calculated cap. However, because the starting on-hand was 0 and we have a long lead time, the pipeline is currently empty relative to the total lead-time demand. Following the capped OR recommendation is safer to avoid over-ordering before we see the first arrival, but given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (fractile is 0.5 as P=1, H=1, actually q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), the OR is being conservative.

The OR agent recommendation is 5 units. This low recommendation occurs because the pipeline of 468 units already exceeds the OR base-stock level (which covers 5 periods of demand, roughly 450-460 units). \n4. Strategy: Since the pipeline is full and the first major arrival of 118 units is expected this period (visible next period), I should follow the OR recommendation to avoid excessive holding costs, as holding cost ($1) is equal to profit ($1), meaning any unit held for one period after arrival wipes out its profit margin.

Current inventory status: On-hand = 199. In-transit = 81 (from P5, P6, P7 orders). Total pipeline + On-hand = 280. The lead time (L=4) requires us to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

However, the 'capped' nature of the OR recommendation is triggered because we have high on-hand inventory relative to recent low demand. Looking at the pipeline: P5 (5 units), P6 (25 units), P7 (51 units), and P8 (0 units) are coming. We have 199 on hand.
