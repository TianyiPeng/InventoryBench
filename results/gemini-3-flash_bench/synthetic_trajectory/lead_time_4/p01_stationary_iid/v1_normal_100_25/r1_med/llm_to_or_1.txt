Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical arrival data to infer actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history for the first five periods (which we observe as a seed) shows samples [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], resulting in a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since this is the first decision period, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this initial distribution. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, targeting a service level that balances the cost of stockouts against inventory holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'in-transit' and not yet arrived. On-hand inventory is 0, lead to 0 sales against a demand of 108. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including the newly reported Period 1) are: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111. The mean of these 5 samples is approximately 89.8. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will leverage all available historical data (the provided 5 samples plus Period 1). Since we have no evidence yet to contradict the promised lead time, L is set to 'default'.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For the first two periods, we have had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales for demands of 108 and 124. This is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (118 units) and Period 2 (121 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 239). Based on the promised lead time (L=4), the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) shows a mean of ~89.8 with a standard deviation of ~17.3. However, the last two periods (P1 and P2) showed higher demand (108 and 124). Given the limited history and the fact that we are still in the lead-time 'blind spot', I will use all available samples to estimate demand but lean towards the higher recent observations. Setting L to default (4) as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered so far (118 + 121 + 130 = 369) are correctly accounted for as In-transit. Demand over the first 3 periods (108, 124, 85) results in a mean of 105.7. Including the historical samples provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111), the overall demand mean is roughly 90.3. Since there are no confirmed changepoints or seasonal indicators in the generic 'Period_X' dates, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. This allows the OR engine to establish a baseline using the total mean and standard deviation across the promised lead time (L=4).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, which is expected for L=4. In-transit inventory is 496 units (sum of orders from P1-P4: 118+121+130+127). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is 108, 124, 85, 79, and 111. The mean demand is approximately 101.4. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and we are waiting for the first order to arrive, we must maintain the base stock level. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of all 5 available samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the initial variance and mean accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [108, 124, 85, 79, 100], yielding a mean of 99.2. There is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift yet, so I will use all available samples (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 425 units, which covers our expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approximately 496 units). Since we only have 18 units on hand and 425 in transit, the OR backend will decide whether an additional order is needed to reach the base stock level. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised one, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial variance accurately.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Current demand mean (P1-P5) is 99.2.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand following the initial stockouts (P1-P4) has stabilized around an average of 99 units (P5=100, P6=98). The inventory pipeline is currently very full (In-transit: 391 units) because of orders placed during the stockout periods. Specifically, orders from P3 (130), P4 (127), P5 (47), and P6 (87) are in transit. Calculating the required base stock for (L+1)=5 periods: with a mean demand of roughly 92 units (average of all 6 samples), we need coverage for ~460 units. Current On-hand (41) + In-transit (391) = 432 units. The OR backend will naturally bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the observable demand mean while excluding the very early noise, and set L to 4 as observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the game history, orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. This confirms the promised lead time of 4 is stable. Demand history for periods 1-7 is: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122. The mean demand is approximately 102.2. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet, as the values fluctuate around this mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history while being slightly more responsive than the 'default' (which might include initialization values) if the history were longer. The backend will calculate the base stock for (1+L) periods (5 periods of demand) to cover the lead time and the current period.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods (P5-P8) confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history for periods 1-8 shows values: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122, 121. The mean demand is approximately 104.6. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as demand fluctuates within a consistent range. On-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit inventory is 359 (consistent with orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8 awaiting arrival). I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistent, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history for forecasting demand over the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 9 (demand 145 vs 102 units available). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand from P1 to P9 shows a slight upward trend or higher variance recently: [108, 124, 100, 98, 122, 121, 145]. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 117.2, which is higher than the initial average. To address the stockout and the rising demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent trend. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4. The target service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and the OR engine will use this to set the base stock for L+1 (5 periods). Current in-transit (427) represents orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from P7-P9: mean demand increased to ~129 vs P1-P6 mean of ~106. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Based on the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P6). The demand has shown a regime shift starting around Period 7. Mean demand for P1-P6 was 99.0, while demand for P7-P10 has averaged 125.75 (122, 121, 145, 115). Period 9 and 10 exhibited stockouts because the arrivals (from P5 and P6) were smaller orders (47 and 87 units) placed before the demand spike was fully recognized. To account for this higher demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~126) and volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods, helping to recover from the current zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P7-P10 mean demand is 125.8 (+27% vs P1-P6 mean of 99.0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5 through 11). Regarding demand, we previously identified a regime shift starting around Period 7. Demand from P7 to P11 has been: 122, 121, 145, 115, 89 (Average: 118.4). However, the sudden drop in P11 (89) compared to the previous four periods (average 125.75) suggests either volatility or a potential softening of that high-demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), and we have a significant pipeline (543 units). Given the high demand in P9 and P10 caused stockouts, a cautious but responsive approach is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~118.4, which acknowledges the recent high demand while weighting the P11 dip. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect recent increased volatility (std dev is approximately 20 in this window). L is set to 'default' as the 4-period lead time is stable and matches the promised time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P11 shows a mean of 118.4 units, though volatility has increased (range 89-145) compared to P1-P6.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 34 units with 494 units in-transit. Historic arrivals (P1-P8 orders) confirm a stable lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 7; demand for the recent 6 periods (P7-P12) has a mean of 115.7 units (122, 121, 145, 115, 89, 102). Although earlier carry-over insights suggested a higher jump, the most recent data (P11-P12) shows a slight cooling (89, 102). I will use a window of N=6 to capture this higher-demand regime while including the recent variance. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as the actual lead time aligns perfectly with the promised 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 6 samples to reflect the post-shift behavior and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P12 stabilized at a mean of ~116 (previously ~99 in P1-P6), confirming a sustained ~17% increase in volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand analysis shows two distinct regimes: P1-P6 averaged ~99 units/period, and P7-P13 averaged ~109.6 units/period. The most recent demand sample was low (73), pulling the recent average down. Based on the changepoint at P7, I am using N=7 for recent demand statistics to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). Period 13 concluded with 76 units on hand, and we have significant in-transit inventory (466 units) covering roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The combination of L=4 and demand parameters based on the last 7 periods (N=7) ensures the base-stock level accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P7-P13 shows a mean of 109.6 units, representing a persistent increase over the P1-P6 baseline (~99 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 10 order at the end of Period 14. Demand has shown a downward trend over the last few periods (P11-P14: 89, 102, 73, 63). The mean demand from the most recent regime starting at Period 7 (P7-P14) is approximately 103.75 units, but the specific last 4 periods average only 81.75 units. This suggests the previously identified 'increase' in demand has dissipated or reversed. On-hand inventory is currently high (162 units) with 368 units in transit. Given the lower recent demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering P7-P14) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough buffer for potential volatility. Method 'calculate' for L is used to leverage the consistently observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: From Period 13-14, demand has dropped significantly (avg 68) compared to the P7-P12 mean of 116. Monitoring for a sustained lower regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P15 conclude where the P11 order arrived). The demand history shows a very volatile recent period. Specifically, from P7 to P12, the mean was approximately 116 units. However, P13 and P14 saw a sharp drop (73 and 63), followed by a massive spike in P15 (142). The average of the last 3 periods (P13, P14, P15) is 92.6, while the average of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 93.8. Although the Carry-Over Insight from P15 noted a drop, P15's actual demand of 142 suggests the demand hasn't settled into a low regime, but rather into a state of high variance. Since On-hand (168) and In-transit (261) total 429 units (covering roughly 4 periods of demand at ~100 units/period), the risk of stockout is currently low. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent volatility while stabilizing the mean around 94 units/period (totaling ~470 for the 1+L window). sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the high recent variance (standard deviation of P11-P15 demand is ~33).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 11, with values ranging from 63 to 142; mean demand for P11-P15 is 93.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand continues to be volatile but has recently stabilized around a moderate mean. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is 97.8 units, while the mean over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 96.5 units. The most recent demand was 108. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 142 and in-transit at 277, total pipeline inventory is 419. At an expected average demand of ~98/period, the coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1), requiring approximately 490 units. Given the higher volatility observed recently (Standard Deviation ~35), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) and sigma_hat (N=6) to capture this increased variance while maintaining a stable mean forecast that accounts for the recent demand pullback from the P7-P10 highs. This ensures we maintain a sufficient service level without over-ordering as individual shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for P11-P16 is 97.8 units, reflecting a stabilization after a period of high volatility (ranges 63-142). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 103.5 units (89, 102, 73, 63, 142, 108, 148). The most recent three periods (P15-P17) show an uptick in demand (142, 108, 148), averaging 132.6 units, suggesting a potential shift back to a higher regime noticed earlier. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 81 and in-transit at 305 units, the pipeline inventory is 386 units. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 7 periods (P11-P17) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced view of the recent mean and the significant volatility observed. This protects against the recent demand spikes while acknowledging the lower values seen in P13-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a sustained demand regime that has shifted multiple times. Initially around 99 units (P1-P6), it rose to ~116 (P7-P12), and most recently exhibits high volatility with a moderate mean. Specifically, demand from P13-P18 (last 6 samples) has a mean of 108.8 units (73, 63, 142, 108, 148, 109). Although we see high variance (std ~34), the average is stable near the long-tail mean. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P14 order reaching conclusion in P18). Current on-hand is low (23), and we have a large in-transit pipeline (411). I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while maintaining a lead time of 4. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) using the most relevant recent distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P13-P18 has settled to a mean of 108.8 units with high volatility (range 63-148), confirming a return to a level near the original baseline but with significantly higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited significant volatility in recent periods. Following a high-demand phase (P7-P12), the demand dropped and then surged again, with P19's demand being 62. The mean of the most recent regime (P13-P19) is approximately 99.3, which aligns closely with the long-term average (P1-P19 mean ~105). Given the variability (range 62 to 148), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatile period while smoothing out extreme outliers. The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods according to the history (P15 order arrived at P19 conclude, L=4). Pipeline inventory (535 units) is currently high relative to on-hand (2), which the OR backend's capped policy should manage, but I will maintain L=4 to ensure the base stock calculation accurately spans the full lead time plus current period exposure.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility demand regime (P13-P19): Mean demand ~99.3, with a wide range (62-148), returning to the original long-term mean but with increased variance.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 100 units in Period 20 (stockout occurred as demand was 102). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 13, the demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 with significantly higher volatility (ranging from 62 to 148). Specifically, the last 8 periods (P13-P20) show a mean demand of 100.8. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this current regime and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent further stockouts given the 0 on-hand inventory and high in-transit volume (472 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P13-P20) mean is 100.8 with high volatility (Std Dev ~32), returning to original mean levels but maintaining elevated variance.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Order from Period 17 arriving exactly as expected in Period 21. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units over the last 9 periods (P13-P21 mean = 101.5), though volatility remains high (ranging from 62 to 148). The current inventory position is very tight: on-hand inventory is 8 units, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline of 446 units (orders from P18-P21) to meet forthcoming demand. Since the demand has returned to the long-term baseline but with increased variance, I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility phase while maintaining a base-stock level that accounts for the 5 periods (L+1) of risk. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P13-P21) confirmed stable mean (~101 units) but sustained high volatility (Std Dev ~31, Range 62-148). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Reviewing the 'Period 22 conclude' message, the order from Period 18 (157 units) arrived after a consistent 4-period lead time. Demand in Period 22 was 105 units. My carry-over insights indicate that since Period 13, the demand mean has stabilized around 101 units, but with significantly increased volatility (Std Dev ~31) compared to the early periods. This demand level is consistent with the initial samples (approx 100 units). Given the lead time is reliably 4 periods, I will set L to 4 using the 'explicit' method to ensure stability. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent stable mean of ~101 units while being responsive to the increased variance observed in the last two weeks. Similarly, for sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to better reflect the current high-volatility regime (Std Dev around 30-35) compared to the full-history average. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting a service level target of 80%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units since Period 13, but with significantly elevated volatility (Standard Deviation ~31) compared to the early periods. Recent demand (P21: 107, P22: 105, P23: 107) reinforces this stable mean around 106-107, although the long-term regime average remains slightly lower. I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking from P13 to P23) to capture the current mean and high-variance behavior. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently 118 on-hand plus 340 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are planning for a 5-period horizon (L+1). The current parameters help the backend maintain a higher safety stock to buffer against the increased variance while targeting a service level based on the $4.00 profit vs $1.00 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stability at mean ~101 with high volatility (Std Dev ~31) confirmed through Period 23. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units since Period 13, following a period of high volatility. Specifically, the mean demand from P13 to P24 is 102.5 units, which is remarkably consistent with the Carry-Over Insight of ~101. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 24 of the order placed in Period 20. Currently, On-hand inventory is 49 units with 412 units in-transit (orders from P21, P22, P23, and P24). Given that the backend base-stock policy considers (L+1) periods of demand, I will focus on the most recent stable regime (N=12, from Period 13 to 24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained high variance (Std Dev ~31) while maintaining the current mean levels to optimize the service level against the $1 holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units since Period 13, but with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 31-32) compared to the initial periods. Recent demand (P21-P25) has been slightly higher, averaging 109 units, but still fits within the high-variance regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on historical arrival data (most recently, P21 order arrived in P25). With on-hand inventory at 13 units and in-transit at 425 units (covering orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25), the system is well-positioned for the arrival cycle. I will use the last 13 periods (P13-P25) to capture the current high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the stable mean and the increased spread to maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~101 units since Period 13, but with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~31) compared to the initial periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the historical data. For Period 27, I am maintaining the lead time 'L' at the promised 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (characterized by high variance) has been sustained for 14 periods (P13-P26), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the observed return to baseline mean levels while capturing the increased demand fluctuation (range 62-148) to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock level to maintain service levels despite the volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently high (445 units), which the backend policy will account for when placing the order.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P21-P27) has shown a mean of approximately 105 units (125, 80, 115, plus previous samples), maintaining the high volatility noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. The pipeline inventory is healthy (413 units), but given the stockouts in P9, P10, and P20, a slightly responsive stance is necessary to prevent stockouts while accounting for the high demand variance. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability and volatility across the last two replenishment cycles (approx 8 periods).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistent around a mean of 105-110 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 13), though individual periods show high variability (range 62-148). The most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) specifically show a mean of 111.2 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 9 units on-hand and 412 in-transit, we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the current stable mean while acknowledging the high variance by using recent_N=15 for sigma_hat as well. This balances the need for a stable forecast with the observed elevated volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in terms of mean since Period 13, centering around 100-105 units, but with significantly higher volatility compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the mean demand is 107.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.8. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Currently, the on-hand inventory is low (13 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (459 units). Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies a higher service level. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable mean of ~107.5, and a recent_N approach for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the sustained higher variance (standard deviation ~16). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is highly reliable.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Sustained demand regime (P20-P29) shows a mean of 107.5 units with a standard deviation of ~15.8. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

The on-hand inventory is 59 with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 419 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of expected demand (4 * 107.5 = 430). The OR backend uses L=4 and (1+L)=5 for calculations. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (P20-P30) to capture the current stable mean. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=11 is also appropriate to reflect the current moderate volatility, ensuring the safety stock is positioned correctly without over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 31 demand (145) exceeded available stock (130). The lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by Period 27's order arriving in Period 31. Demand has shown a sustained regime from Period 20 to Period 31, with a mean of approximately 109 units and a standard deviation of approximately 19.4. Earlier carry-over insights also noted a mean around 107.5 for P20-P29. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand 0) and the relatively low holding cost compared to profit (4:1 ratio), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 12 periods (P20-P31) to capture this stabilized demand level while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P20-P31) mean is 109 units with a standard deviation of ~19.4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we observed a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0) despite an arrival of 106 units, as demand was 111. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 20, the demand has settled into a regime with a mean of approximately 109 units (P20-P32 average is 108.9). However, recent volatility has increased, with demand reaching 145 in P31. To prevent stockouts during the 4-period lead time wait, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the stable regime since P20) to capture the current mean and the elevated variance. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P32) shows a mean of 109 units with a standard deviation of ~19.1. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term, with the most recent regime (P20-P33) exhibiting a mean of approximately 109 units and a standard deviation of 19. Recently, demand has fluctuated between 87 and 145 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P29 order in P33. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 44 units, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 430 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). At the start of P34, we are awaiting the arrival of the order from P30 (93 units). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is approximately 80%, meaning the OR backend will aim for a base stock that covers roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability and variance observed since Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P33) shows a mean of 109.1 units with a standard deviation of ~18.8. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods (P20-P34). The current mean demand for this regime (P20-P34) is 108.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. The OR backend will use these statistics to calculate a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the profit/holding cost ratio which dictates a service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 439 units. The backend's capped policy will manage the order size relative to current pipeline inventory and detected demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P34) mean is 108.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Lead time remains reliably confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime (P20-P35) with a mean of approximately 108.3 units and a standard deviation of 17.8. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. I will continue using a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=16 to cover the stable regime since Period 20) to maximize forecast accuracy while acknowledging the current volatility. Despite a low on-hand inventory of 11 units, the in-transit pipeline (454 units) is substantial, representing over 4 periods of average demand, which the OR backend will account for when determining the next order size to maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable with a mean of approximately 108-109 units and moderate volatility (Std Dev ~18). Observations from Period 20 to Period 36 show consistent behavior. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is low (27 units) with significant in-transit stock (420 units). The Backend OR logic uses a capped base-stock policy. To maintain the target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering Periods 20-36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while acknowledging the observed variance. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stable mean around 108-110 units with moderate volatility. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 30 to Period 37 is 108.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 37 (order from Period 33 arrived with lead_time=4). The on-hand inventory is 63, and the large in-transit pipeline (429 units) reflects recent orders (approx. 100-140 units per period) designed to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will maintain the 'recent_N' method with N=18 for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the stable regime observed over the last several weeks while dampening historical noise. Lead time will remain at 'default' (promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P37) mean is ~108.4 units with a standard deviation of ~18.5. Lead time remains reliably confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable around a mean of ~108 units following the analysis from Period 20 to Period 38. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=19 (covering periods 20-38) to capture this sustained regime accurately. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=19 to reflect the current volatility of this period (std dev ~18.5). On-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit is 404, which covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (108 * 5 = 540 expected vs 459 total). The backend OR engine will calculate the required adjustment to maintain the base stock level given the lead time L=4.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 20. Analyzing demand from P20 to P39 (the last 20 periods) yields a mean demand of 107.0 units with a standard deviation of 17.6. Lead time has been remarkably stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of every order since P5). The current on-hand inventory is 56, and in-transit inventory is 420. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, meaning the OR backend will target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established stability, and keep L at 'default' since the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P39) shows a consistent mean of 107.0 units and a standard deviation of 17.6. Lead time remains reliably confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that began around Period 20. For the period P20-P40, the mean demand is 106.2 with a standard deviation of 17.5. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 70, In-transit: 404) are healthy, and recent arrivals (P36 order arriving in P40) confirm the reliability of the supply chain. I will continue to use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the stability of this long-term regime while staying responsive to any sudden shifts. Setting N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire stable regime from P20-P40.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P20-P40) reflects a mean of 106.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Lead time remains constant at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has been stable with a mean of approximately 106 units and a standard deviation around 17.5. Looking at the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean is 101.3 and the standard deviation is 17.2, showing a slight decrease in volume and stability in variance. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P37 order arrived in P41). Inventory levels are healthy with 134 on hand and a pipeline adjusted for the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability while maintaining a sufficient sample size for the backend's OR calculations. Method 'calculate' for L will use all historical lead time observations, which are consistently 4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the last two periods (Period 41: 64, Period 42: 65) compared to the sustained mean of approximately 106-109 observed between Periods 20 and 40. This suggests a potential regime change or seasonal drop. To avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs (since on-hand inventory is currently high at 146 and in-transit is 313), I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower demand trend. Using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat will weight the last two low periods (64, 65) and the preceding 91 more heavily, bringing the projected demand down to ~73 per period. Sigma_hat is kept on a slightly longer lookback (N=10) to account for the increased volatility seen in earlier transitions while responding to the current variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime downward shift starting Period 41: demand dropped to ~64.5 (P41-P42) from a previous mean of ~106. Monitoring for sustainability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting in Period 41. Demand over the last three periods (P41-P43) has averaged 63.7 units, a sharp decline from the previous 20-period mean of 107.0. Given this sustained drop, I am shifting the forecasting regime to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the lower mean and reduced volatility, preventing excessive overstocking. The on-hand inventory (194) and in-transit (203) are currently high relative to this new demand level, so reducing the replenishment targets is necessary to manage holding costs. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downward shift confirmed (P41-P43): mean demand decreased to 63.7 units (-40% vs P20-P40 mean of 107.0). Volatility also appears lower.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a significant downward shift starting at Period 41. The mean demand for the last four periods (P41-P44) is 64.75 units (64, 65, 62, 68), which is approximately a 40% decrease from the previous stable mean of ~107. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 215 units and 114 units in transit (expected from orders in P41 and P42), the total pipeline of 329 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of approximately 324 units over the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current rate. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with this new lower-demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 41, but Period 45 showed a significant spike back to 116 units, disrupting the mean of ~65 observed in Periods 41-44. This suggests either high volatility or a potential return to the previous higher demand mean (~107). Current on-hand inventory is high (186 units) due to the low demand in the previous four periods. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory levels, the pipeline plus on-hand (186 + 27 = 213) is sufficient to cover approximately three periods of demand even at the higher historical mean. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to incorporate the lower demand from P41-P44 while acknowledging the P45 spike (Mean P41-P45 \u2248 71). I'll use explicit sigma_hat to account for the sudden high volatility (62 to 116 range). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P41-P45): Mean demand has shifted to approximately 71 units following a period of low demand (P41-P44 avg ~65) and a sharp spike in P45 (116). Volatility has increased significantly during this shift.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. A downward demand shift occurred at Period 41, where the mean dropped to ~64 units (P41-P44), followed by a spike to 116 (P45) and 81 (P46). The mean for this recent volatile period (P41-P46) is approximately 76 units. Current on-hand inventory is 132 units, and in-transit is 94 units (from orders in P43, P44, P45, P46; specifically P46 ordered 94, others were 0). However, looking at the history, orders from P43, P44, and P45 were actually 0, so the 'in-transit' of 94 is solely from the Period 46 order. This means no arrivals are expected in Periods 47, 48, or 49. Inventory needs to cover demand for current and next 4 periods (L+1=5). At a mean of ~76, 5 periods of demand is ~380. Even if demand reverts to the higher mean (107), 5 periods is ~535. Current total inventory is 226 (132+94). The OR backend will order to bridge this gap. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean shift and the high volatility of the last 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P41-P46) reflects a lower mean of ~76 units compared to previous levels, but with high recent volatility (Std Dev significantly increased due to P45 spike).

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system is resolving Period 47's activities and looking toward the finale in Period 50. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) following high recent demand (127 units in Period 47). Lead time is reliably 4 periods, meaning an order placed today (P48) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end (P50). However, there are 205 units in-transit: these should correspond to orders from P43 (0 units), P44 (0 units), P45 (0 units), P46 (94 units), and P47 (111 units). The arrival scheduled for P47 (ordered P43) was 0 units, as confirmed by 'arrived=0' in the P47 conclude message. This explains the current inventory dip. The next expected arrival (P48) is also 0 units (ordered P44). The first significant arrival will be in P50 (94 units ordered in P46). Regarding demand, the mean for P41-P47 is ~83.6 with significant volatility (Std Dev ~24.5), representing a lower but unstable regime compared to the P20-P40 average. Since orders placed now won't arrive before the game ends, I am setting parameters to ensure the backend accounts for the current pipeline (205 units) against the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (~250 units total) to avoid excessive holding costs in the final period while trying to satisfy remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P41-P47): mean is approximately 83.6 units, reflecting a lower but highly volatile state compared to previous historical averages (Std Dev ~24.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 49. In Period 48, demand was 83 and on-hand inventory dropped to 0, resulting in lost sales. There is a critical gap in arrivals: orders from Period 43 and Period 44 (which should have arrived in Periods 47 and 48 based on the 4-period lead time) have not arrived, confirming they are likely lost or significantly delayed. The order from Period 45 (0 units) would have arrived this period. I have 333 units in-transit (orders from P46, P47, and P48). Demand analysis: after a low period (P41-P44 avg ~65), the last four periods (P45-P48) have shown a significant rebound with a mean of 101.75 units (116, 81, 127, 83). I will shift my forecast to reflect this recent rebound while acknowledging the high volatility observed. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the mix of the low dip and the recent recovery (P41-P48 avg ~85.8), which provides a balanced but conservative estimate given the game is nearing the end (Period 50). I will stick to 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the historical 4-period average, as the recent non-arrivals are treated as lost rather than a shift in lead time duration.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 43 and Period 44 (expected arrivals Period 47 and 48) are confirmed lost/delayed, resulting in 0 units arrived despite the 4-period lead time. Demand has rebounded from the P41-P44 low (avg 65) to a P45-P48 mean of ~102.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 50. Analysis of recent 'conclude' messages confirms a significant supply chain disruption: shipments from Period 43 through Period 45 (expected in Periods 47-49) have failed to arrive, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Despite these losses, the backend OR controller still considers these units as 'in-transit', which would normally suppress new orders. To force the system to replenish inventory and account for the high probability that these in-transit units are lost, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 8. This effectively extends the protection window to cover the missing shipments. For demand, the most recent regime (P45-P49) shows a rebound with a mean of approximately 108.4 units and standard deviation of ~24.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this immediate trend and provide higher safety stock to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Shipments from P43, P44, and P45 (totaling 0 units) are confirmed lost/delayed as of P49. Demand has rebounded from the P41-P44 low (avg 65) to a mean of ~108.4 (P45-P49).
