Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the 'sold=0' in history confirms no stock arrived yet, which is consistent with L=4.\n2.

Period 47 (Period_47) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major shift around Period 41, decreasing from an average of ~105 to approximately 76 units over the last 6 periods (64, 65, 62, 68, 116, 81). Current on-hand inventory is high at 202 units, and the in-transit pipeline contains 153 units (orders from P43-P45: 63, 60, 30). With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, order arrivals are as follows: P47 (P43 order: 63 units), P48 (P44 order: 60 units), P49 (P45 order: 30 units), and P50 (P46 order: 0 units). Total inventory available through the end of the game (Period 50) is 202 (on-hand) + 153 (in-transit) = 355 units. Given that there are only 4 periods remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50), and estimated demand is ~76 units/period, total expected demand is roughly 304 units. The current total inventory of 355 units already exceeds this expected demand. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without increasing sales, especially since any order placed now (P47) would not arrive until the game has concluded (P51, based on the 4-period lead time). The OR recommendation of 138 is ignored because it fails to account for the finite horizon and the sufficient existing pipeline.",

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize profit (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory) through the end of Period 50. Analysis of the current situation: 1) Game End Timing: We are at the start of Period 48. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. Orders placed now (Period 48) will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is AFTER the game ends. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs (if we were paying for procurement, though here it's about holding costs and lost sales) and cannot satisfy demand within the game's horizon. 2) Inventory Status: On-hand inventory is 138 units. In-transit inventory includes 60 units (ordered Period 44, arriving Period 48) and 30 units (ordered Period 45, arriving Period 49). 3) Demand Outlook: Recent demand shifted from ~105 to ~64, though Periods 45-47 saw a spike (116, 81, 127). Even with the spike, the 138 units on hand plus the 60 units arriving this period (Period 48) and 30 units next period (Period 49) provide a total of 228 units to cover Periods 48, 49, and 50. This is more than sufficient (average ~76 units/period). 4) Action: Since new orders cannot arrive before the game ends, ordering more units is counter-productive as it provides no utility. I am overriding the OR recommendation of 139 units to 0.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The game ends at Period 50, meaning this Period 49 decision is the final opportunity to place an order. However, since the confirmed lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4 = 53), which is well past the game's conclusion. Consequently, any capital spent on ordering now is a pure loss with no potential for revenue. My current inventory status is 115 units on-hand, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (Period 49 and Period 50), especially considering the recent demand regime shift to an average of ~64 units. The 30 units in-transit from Period 45 are expected to arrive in Period 49 conclusion (visible at start of P50), further cushioning the stock. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units to maximize profit and avoid unnecessary holding costs or stranded capital.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently with several spikes exceeding 110 units (P45, P47, P49) despite a previously noted average drop. The Carry-over insight regarding a regime shift to ~64 units should be treated with caution given these recent 100+ demand days. On-hand inventory is critically low (10 units) and there is ZERO pipeline inventory (In-transit: 0) because no orders were placed in Periods 46-49. This is a severe stockout risk over the next 4 periods (the confirmed lead time). The OR recommendation of 139 units is robust as it accounts for this empty pipeline and the need to restore a safety stock level (base stock) relative to the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will follow the OR recommendation exactly to restart the pipeline and prevent a prolonged stockout, as 139 units represents roughly two periods of elevated demand or 2.1 periods of the nominal 64-unit average, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time.",
