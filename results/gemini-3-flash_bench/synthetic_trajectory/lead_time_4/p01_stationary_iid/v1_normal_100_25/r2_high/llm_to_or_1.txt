Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (including current) is available: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111. The mean demand across these samples is 89.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 17.15. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 1), I will use 'default' for L to align with the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' which calculates the forecast based on all available samples (89.8 * (1+4) = 449 and sqrt(1+4) * 17.15). This provides a baseline inventory level (base stock) to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). No changepoints or lead-time deviations are visible yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and lost all sales in Period 1 (demand=89, sold=0). The historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111) suggests a mean demand of approximately 90 units per period. Since we have no concluded lead time data yet, I will use the default lead time (4 periods). For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=1 (the only observed game period so far has a demand of 89, which is consistent with the pre-game samples) to ensure we are responsive to the current game state while the backend calculates over the (1+L) horizon.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods was 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 (mean \u2248 89.8). In the last two active periods (P1 and P2), demand was 89 and 98 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 239 units in transit (118 ordered in P1, 121 in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', we should not expect the P1 order to arrive until the end of Period 5 (visible in P6). Therefore, the stockout in P1 and P2 is expected as we started with 0 inventory and lead time > 0. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture the overall average, and the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (118 units), Period 2 (121 units), and Period 3 (114 units) are currently in-transit (total 353). Because actual lead time is 4, we expect the first shipment (from Period 1) to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (89, 98, 114) exceeds available stock. Historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) show a mean of approximately 89.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on all available samples to establish a stable baseline, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or deviant lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is L=4. In Periods 1-4, orders were placed (Total in-transit: 473), but no arrivals have occurred yet. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in the first 4 periods. The demand samples for Period 1-5 are [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], with a mean of ~90. Since no lead times have been 'concluded' yet, I will stick to the default L=4. For demand and volatility, given the stability and small sample size, I will use all available samples (N=5) to generate parameters. The OR backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $842.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (arriving during Period 5, confirmed in Period 5 conclude). Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, with 433 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods was: 89, 98, 114, 101, 48. Note: The demand samples provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) differ from the 'GAME HISTORY' values (89, 98, 114, 101, 48). I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY as it represents the actual observed demand in this specific run. The mean demand over these 5 periods is 90.0, but the most recent period (Period 5) showed a significant drop to 48. However, one data point is not enough to confirm a regime shift. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive. Lead time L is confirmed at the default 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1069.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7. Reviewing history: orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly on their promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). This confirms L=4 is currently stable. In-transit inventory counts 352 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), which matches our expectations for a 4-period lead time. Regarding demand: the initial samples provided were [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (avg ~89.8). In-game demand for P1-P4 was [89, 98, 114, 101] (avg 100.5). However, P5 and P6 saw a significant drop to 48 and 63. Using N=5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent lower demand while still accounting for the earlier higher volume, preventing an over-correction while on-hand inventory is healthy (128 units). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived in P5 and P6 respectively).

Daily Reward (R_t): $838.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived exactly at P4+1, P5+1, and P6+1, visible at the start of the subsequent periods). The demand pattern shows a distinct shift around Period 5. For Periods 1-4, the demand mean was 100.5. From Period 5-7, the demand mean dropped to 55.0. Given this significant regime change, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand levels and avoid over-ordering based on the higher initial demand samples. The on-hand inventory is currently high (188) due to the arrival of larger earlier orders meeting lower recent demand. The OR backend will see the pipeline of 285 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7) and current on-hand to determine if a new order is needed under the base-stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean decreased from ~100 to ~55 (-45%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1772.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing regular chips with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, we have observed a significant decline in demand. The initial demand (P1-P4) averaged ~100 units/period, whereas the most recent demand (P5-P8) has averaged 67.25 units/period (48, 63, 54, 104). Period 8 saw a spike back to 104, which suggests the previous 'regime shift' insight might be premature or the volatility is higher than expected. However, with 204 units on-hand and 165 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8), our current inventory position of 369 units is very high relative to the recent mean. At a mean of ~80 and L=4, the base stock would be around 400-450. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand levels (Recent Mean = 67.25 * (1+4) = 336.25) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility (Std Dev of 48, 63, 54, 104 is ~25). This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand remains volatile; recent 4-period average is 67.25 units, significantly lower than the initial 100 units, but P8 showed a sharp recovery to 104.

Daily Reward (R_t): $758.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 5). Demand has stabilized at a lower level than the initial phase (Periods 1-4 avg: ~100). Following a sharp drop starting in Period 5, current demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averages 64.2 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52). Although Period 8 was an outlier (104), the surrounding periods suggest a mean near 65. With 230 units on hand and 148 in transit (378 total pipeline), we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon (Expected demand 5 * 65 = 325). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current regime and explicitly set L=4 to match observations. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a safe but lean inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 65 units/period since Period 5 (P5-P9 average: 64.2). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P1 through P6). The demand has shifted since Period 5; the initial average (P1-P4) was approximately 100.5, while the recent average (P5-P10) is 67.33 units. Although P8 and P10 showed higher demand (104 and 83), the overall trend is lower than the start. We are currently carrying a high inventory of 187 units on-hand with 136 in transit (Total pipeline = 323). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A recent_N of 6 periods for mu_hat (67.33 * 5 = 336.65) suggests we are nearly at the target base stock level already. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift that occurred after Period 4, and use the default lead time which matches the observed 4 periods.

Demand since Period 5 has shown a regime shift. While the average from Period 5 to 11 is approximately 71.3 units per period, the last three periods (P9-P11) have shown a steady increase (52, 83, 95). This suggests demand is recovering towards the original level (~100) or at least stabilizing at a higher mean than previously thought. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average (P5-P11) which is approximately 71.3, resulting in a base stock targeted at (1+4)*71.3 \u2248 356 units. This balances the recent lows with the current upward trend. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-11 shows recovery; mean has increased to ~71 units/period compared to the ~65 units/period observed in periods 5-9.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the order placed in Period 8 did not arrive as expected. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, an order placed in Period 8 should have arrived during Period 12 and been reflected in the 'Period 12 conclude' message. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 12, and history shows a consistent 4-period lead time for all previous arrivals (P1-P7), this strongly suggests the Period 8 order (which was 0 units) or subsequent logic is behaving correctly regarding physical arrivals, but we must note that P8's order was actually 0 units. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' is expected. My pipeline inventory is 293 (P9: 61, P10: 28, P11: 95, P12: 109). Demand remains in a higher-volatility regime. The average demand from P5 to P12 is approximately 70.8 units. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized but slightly upwards-trending demand regime (P5-P12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1242.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 5. Demand in Period 1-4 averaged 100.5, while demand from Period 5-13 has averaged 70 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95, 62, 69). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, and P13 all show L=4). Note: the order from Period 8, which resulted in 0 units ordered, technically 'arrived' or resolved in Period 12, explaining why 'arrived=0' was reported for the arrival resolution of the P8 order. To capture the current demand regime (P5-P13), I will use the last 9 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This stabilizes the mean at approximately 70 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat should effectively target 5 periods of demand (350 total). Pipeline inventory is currently 291 and on-hand is 69, totaling 360, which is close to our target but requires replenishment to account for upcoming variance and lead-time cover.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed 70 units/period since Period 5 (P5-P13 mean: 70.0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we experienced a stockout (demand 128 vs 97 available) because the order from Period 8, which was 0 units, would have arrived during Period 12 (Lead Time = 4), and subsequnt arrivals (P9/P10) were small. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a regime shift since Period 5, averaging approximately 74 units/period (P5-P14 mean: 73.9, P10-P14 mean: 87.4). Due to the stockout and the recent volatility (P14 demand was 128), I will use a larger N=10 window for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean while smoothing recent spikes. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. The target is to rebuild inventory (on-hand is currently 0) to meet future demand while accounting for a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 5 updated: mean has drifted upward to ~74 units/period (P5-P14 avg). Stockout occurred in Period 14 due to empty Period 8 replenishment and high Period 14 demand (128).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing a stockout situation for the second consecutive period. Although 95 units arrived (ordered in Period 11), a high demand of 107 units exhausted all available stock, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory entering Period 16. The demand regime from Period 5 to 15 shows a mean of approximately 76.5 units/period (total demand 841 / 11 periods), reflecting an upward drift from the previous average of 70. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order from Period 8 (0 units) caused a supply gap in Period 12, while the low shipment from Period 10 (28 units) contributed to the stockout in Period 14. We currently have 350 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). Specifically, the P12 order of 109 units is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 16, which will help alleviate the stockout. To recover from back-to-back stockouts and adjust to the upward demand drift, mu_hat is set using recent_N=11 (tracking the regime since Period 5) to capture the current mean of ~76.5 units/period. Sigma_hat is also calculated using N=11 to account for recent volatility, including the spike to 128 observed in Period 14. This will elevate the base stock level to better cover demand during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 5 updated: mean has increased to ~76.5 units/period (P5-P15 avg: 76.45) with significant spikes (e.g., P14: 128, P15: 107). Stockouts occurred in P14 and P15.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of Period 12's order in Period 16. However, the demand environment remains highly volatile with a rising trend. Following a significant dip between Periods 5 and 10, demand has surged again, including peaks of 128 (P14) and 107 (P15). The mean demand since the regime change in Period 5 (P5-P16) is approximately 79.25 units/period, but the last three periods (P14-P16) averaged 105 units. Stockouts occurred in Periods 14 and 15 because of late arrivals and high demand volatility. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as it has been consistent. For mu_hat, I'm using N=6 to capture the most recent higher demand trend (P11-P16 avg = 90.17) while smoothing the extreme volatility of the last three periods. Sigma_hat is set to N=12 (all samples since the major shift in P5) to capture the full variance seen in this new environment, ensuring the backend maintains enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 11 has shifted upward: mean demand for P11-P16 is ~90 units/period (compared to ~65-70 earlier), characterized by high spikes and recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1452.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 11, with recent periods (P11-P17) averaging 88.4 units per period (compared to ~65-70 previously). Although P16 and P17 were slightly lower (80 and 77 respectively), earlier spikes up to 128 demand caused stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable (all recent arrivals from P13, P12, P11, etc. confirmed L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but in-transit inventory is high (437 units), including orders from P14 (63), P15 (119), P16 (123), and P17 (132). To avoid excessive over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for the detected high-demand regime, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the shift from Period 11). This will ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased mean (~88) and volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized since Period 11: mean demand increased to ~88.4 (P11-P17 avg) from the previous ~70 avg, with persistent volatility (std ~22). Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 453 units in-transit. In Period 18, demand was 104, while only 74 units were sold due to a stockout. Historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 11, the demand regime has shifted upward and stabilized with a mean of approximately 88.4 units per period (P11-P18 avg: 89.1) and a standard deviation of roughly 22. To avoid further stockouts and align with this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 11 to Period 18). This captures the current demand intensity while filtering out the lower demand seen earlier in the game. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) periods, which is essential given the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 11: mean demand is approximately 89 units/period (P11-P18 avg), showing significant recovery and sustained higher volume compared to the P5-P10 period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a higher level than the previous dip, with an average of approximately 89 units per period (P11-P19 avg is 89.7). Although there were stockouts in periods 14, 15, and 18, the most recent period (P19) shows demand of 86, aligning well with this current forecast. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 33 units on-hand and a high in-transit quantity of 414 (which includes recent large orders from periods 16-19), the pipeline is significant. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 9 samples (since Period 11) to capture this sustained higher mean while maintaining the lead time at the stable 4 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the volatility seen in this regime (standard deviation approximately 21.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2664.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shifted clearly upward with a mean of approximately 91.5 units (P11-P20 average) and high volatility, as evidenced by the Period 20 demand spike to 141. The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 20 (where the Period 16 order arrived). On-hand inventory is very low (15 units) after a high-demand period, leaving the system vulnerable until the next arrival. To capture the recent high-demand trend and safeguard against stockouts during this volatile period, I am using a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from Period 11 (N=10). This focuses the backend calculation on the current high-demand regime (+90 avg) rather than the lower mid-game demand (~65 avg).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed since Period 11: mean reached 91.5 units/period (P11-P20 avg) with increased volatility (max demand 141 in P20). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shifted clearly upward with a mean of 92.5 units/period (P11-P21 average) and higher volatility (standard deviation ~23). The most recent period (P21) saw a demand of 102 following a peak of 141 in P20, confirming this higher volume regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 45 units with 375 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). I will use the recent 11 periods (P11-P21) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this sustained higher demand level while accounting for recent spikes to ensure the OR backend targets an appropriate service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed since Period 11: mean reached 92.5 units/period (P11-P21 avg) with sustained higher volumes (P20: 141, P21: 102).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 92 units per period (P11-P22 average is ~91.9). Recent demand levels remain consistently around or above this mean (P20: 141, P21: 102, P22: 86), suggesting a sustained recovery from the earlier dip. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrival history (P18 order arrived in P22). To capture the current demand state accurately, I am using recent_N with N=12 to cover the period since the last major regime shift (Period 11), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and volatility (std dev ~22).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-22 confirmed: mean demand is ~92 units/period, showing a significant and sustained increase from the P5-P10 period (~67 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1282.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime that began around Period 11. Analysis of the demand from Period 11 to Period 23 shows a mean of approximately 90.8 units per period, a significant increase from the low seen between Periods 5-10 (~67 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 15-19. Currently, on-hand inventory is 48 units, with 442 units in transit. The high 'in-transit' volume reflects the backend's response to recent high demand spikes (e.g., P20 at 141 units) and the replenishment of safety stocks. I will set the demand parameters using the last 13 periods (N=13, covering P11-P23) to capture this sustained higher mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current ~91 units/period demand pattern across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-23 confirmed: mean demand is approximately 91 units/period (P11-P23 avg: 90.8), showing a sustained recovery and stabilizing significantly higher than the P5-P10 average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 91 units per period (P11-P24 average is 91.1). Recent volatility persists, with Period 24 demand at 113. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. Since the demand regime transitioned around Period 11 and has remained consistently higher than the P5-P10 period, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering P11-P24) to capture this established higher-demand state and its associated variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current 90+ units/period average while respecting the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio is 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-24 stable: mean demand is 91.1 units/period, showing a sustained recovery and stabilizing significantly higher than the P5-P10 average (~67 units).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 91.1 units per period (calculated from P11-P25) and standard deviation around 21.6. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand phase (P5-P10). The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrival data (P21 order arrived in P25, LT=4), so I am using the default (promised) lead time of 4. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation (for L+1 periods) is aligned with the current stabilized demand level of ~91 units/period while accounting for the recent variability to maintain high service levels and avoid the stockouts seen between P14-P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1797.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has established a stable mean of approximately 92 units per period (P11-P26 average is 91.87) with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This is a significant structural shift upward from the earlier P5-P10 period. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 22 order arriving in Period 26). The current on-hand inventory is 84 units, and the pipeline is substantial at 374 units. To maintain the backend's target service level (95% based on profit/holding ratio) while adjusting to the current regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering P11 through P26) to accurately capture the sustained demand increase and volatility since the shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-26 confirmed: mean demand is 91.9 units/period, showing sustained recovery and stabilization significantly higher than the P5-P10 average (~67 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 92 units per period (P11-P27 mean: 92.4; recent 5-period mean: 103.8). Although the recent 5-period mean is slightly higher, the long-term stabilization since the P11 shift is the most reliable anchor. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the P23 order arriving in P27 as expected (L=4). Inventory levels are currently being replenished by large in-transit volumes from P24-P27 orders. I will use the recent 17 periods (from the P11 shift onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures the higher demand level and volatility (std dev ~22).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units per period and significant volatility (standard deviation ~20-25). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units, with 426 units in transit. The replenishment cycle (L+1) is 5 periods, requiring a target coverage of approximately 463 units (92.5 * 5). The backend OR logic uses the service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95. I will continue to use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the current regime since Period 11) to capture the sustained higher volume and variability while ensuring the pipeline inventory remains robust against stockouts seen in Periods 14-18.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 93.6 units/period (P11-P29). Recent variability (Period 29 demand of 138) confirms the need for a robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (P21 order arrived P25, P22 order arrived P26, P23 order arrived P27, P24 order arrived P28, P25 order arrived P29). To optimize the base stock for the OR backend, I've set L to 4 and mu_hat to 468 units (calculated as (1+4) * 93.6), reflecting the sustained demand increase since the mid-game slump. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on the observed standard deviation of approximately 22.4 over the stable P11-P29 period (sqrt(1+4) * 22.4 \u2248 50). This should maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-29 remains stable: mean demand is 93.6 units/period, showing recovery from the Period 5-10 low. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

The most recent demand was lower (65), but the overall trend since P11 remains consistent. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals matching the promised window. On-hand inventory is 70, and there is a healthy pipeline of 409 units. I will use a recent window (N=19, covering Period 12 to Period 30) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=4 (default) is appropriate given the history.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 93.6 units/period observed up to Period 29. Recent demand from Period 21 to Period 31 has remained consistent with this recovery pattern (averaging ~95 units). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (Orders from P24-P27 arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 83, and in-transit inventory is 397 (Orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). We will use L=4 and calculate parameters based on the stable regime starting from Period 11 (N = 21 periods: P11 to P31) to capture the higher demand mean and variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the current ~95 unit/period demand environment while accounting for the ~20 unit standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2133.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, higher-volume regime since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 93.8 units per period (P11-P32). While there is some volatility (std ~22), the mean has not significantly shifted recently. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the Period 28 order arriving exactly on time in Period 32. Total in-transit inventory (372 units) plus current on-hand inventory (71 units) is 443. This is roughly equivalent to 4.7 periods of demand (443 / 93.8). Given L=4, the base stock targets usually cover L+1 = 5 periods. With the critical ratio (q) for this SKU being 19/(19+1) = 0.95, the OR backend will target a high service level. Using recent_N=22 (covering the current regime from P11 to P32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the forecast reflects this sustained higher-demand period while accounting for its inherent volatility. This approach maintains sufficient stock to prevent the stockouts seen in earlier periods while managing the holding cost in a period where inventory is relatively high.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 93.6 units as noted in the Carry-Over Insights. Recent demand in Periods 29-33 (138, 65, 85, 116, 115) averages to 103.8, suggesting a potential slight upward trend or continued high volatility (standard deviation ~28). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Given the current on-hand inventory of 32 and high recent demand, maintaining a robust base stock is necessary to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering Period 11 to present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established higher-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility. The L parameter will remain 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 11, with a mean demand around 93-94 units/period. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 98.4 units, which is slightly higher than the overall average since P11, indicating a minor upward drift or sustained volatility. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 76, which is lower than the recent average, but given the volatility (std_dev approx 22-25), I will use the last 15 periods to capture a robust mean for the current regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 87 and in-transit at 403, our pipeline is healthy. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 periods (back to P20) will provide a balanced estimate reflecting the higher demand levels observed in the latter half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period_25 to Period_34 shows a mean of 98.4 units/period, maintaining the higher demand levels established after Period 11.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since approximately Period 11, with recent data (P25-P35) showing a mean of 98.4 units per period. The most recent demand (P31-P35) averages 101 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P34 and P35). We are currently in Period 36, and the goal is to set parameters for the OR backend based on the most recent stable regime. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand levels (approx 98 units/period) while filtering out older, lower demand periods. This translates to an expected demand over the lead time + review period (L+1=5) of approximately 490-500 units. The lead time L is set to 'default' (4), which is backed by clear historical confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1662.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable and higher since roughly Period 11, with more recent data (Period 25-36) supporting a mean of approximately 98-100 units per period. The most recent demand values (P33: 115, P34: 76, P35: 114, P36: 90) continue to reflect this level of volume and volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Inventory management is functioning well with a base stock policy covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable higher demand regime (starting around Period 25), providing a balance between responsiveness and stability.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 98.4 units/period (P25-P34 avg). Most recent demand observations (P34: 76, P35: 114, P36: 90, P37: 119) maintain this average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units, and in-transit is 403 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a 13-period window (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established 'high demand' regime starting around P25, while providing enough data points for a stable variance estimate. This window covers the period where demand stabilized near the ~100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $813.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable with a sustained recovery since Period 11. Analysis of recent demand (Period 25 to 38) shows a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period. The most recent period (P38) saw a lower demand of 49, but this follows a series of higher demand periods (P35: 114, P36: 90, P37: 119). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the stabilized demand regime starting after Period 24, which reflects the current 'high' state. This window provides a balance between responsiveness to the recent slight upward drift and statistical stability. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, ensuring a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 to Period 38 shows a mean of 98.7 units per period, consistently higher than previous regimes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 98.7 units per period (P25-P39) and a standard deviation of approximately 21.9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently realized without any missing shipments or drifts in recent history. Current inventory is 127 units on-hand with 362 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. Setting L to the promised 4 periods and using 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most relevant demand regime from Period 25 to the present, ensuring the order covers the pipeline needs (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1923.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime for chips(Regular) from Period 25 to Period 40 maintains a mean of approximately 98.6 units per period. Period 40 demand was 108 units, consistent with this stabilized higher level. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as observed in the latest arrivals. The current inventory position is healthy with 129 units on hand and 329 in transit. To maintain the target base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand, I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 25 (N=16 periods). This captures the current demand mean and volatility while balancing the service level against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 to Period 40 confirms a stable mean of 98.6 units per period, consistently higher than initial game periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~98.6 units per period since Period 25. The most recent demand observations (P39: 84, P40: 108, P41: 101) align with this regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the historical data. The inventory position is currently healthy with 110 units on hand and 357 units in transit, which covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the stability of the demand and lead time, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 25 to Period 41) to capture the current stable higher-demand regime while maintaining a standard service level calculated by the OR backend.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 through Period 42, the average demand is approximately 98.4 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21.8. The lead time has been remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods across all observed arrivals. For Period 43, I am following the 'stable' regime strategy: using L=4 (default) and setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the latest stable window (N=18 periods, from P25 to P42). This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) remains responsive to the current 98.4 units/period average while accounting for observed variance. Current on-hand inventory (123) and in-transit (330) are being balanced by the OR backend's inventory position logic.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 98-99 units per period since Period 25. The most recent demand (P43) was 77, but the longer-term trend remains around ~98.6 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 90 units on-hand and 402 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43), the system needs to maintain a pipeline that covers demand over the L+1 (5) period window. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=19 (matching the stable regime since P25) provides a robust forecast of ~98-99/period while filtering out minor noise. sigma_hat with N=19 captures current volatility efficiently. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place a replenishment order for P44.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the stable regime established around Period 25. The mean demand from Period 25 to Period 44 is approximately 97.4 units per period (sum=1948, N=20), which is consistent with the insights from Period 41. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current period is 45 and the game ends at period 50, the pipeline inventory (ordered in periods 41, 42, 43, 44, plus the order placed now in 45) will cover all remaining demand. Specifically, orders from P41 arrive in P45, P42 in P46, P43 in P47, P44 in P48, and the P45 order in P49. The P45 order will be the last one to arrive before the game ends (P50 conclusion). Current on-hand is 89. In-transit consists of 110 (P41), 99 (P42), 116 (P43), and 72 (P44). I will use the recent 20-period mean (N=20) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain the current service level for the final periods.

Current on-hand inventory is 100 units, and the pipeline inventory is 359 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45), totaling 459 units. To maintain the target service level (q = 0.95 given $19 profit and $1 holding cost), I will use the established recent demand statistics (N=21 for the regime starting at P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time of 4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable in the final phase of the game. For chips(Regular), the mean demand from Period 25 to Period 46 is approximately 98.7 units per period (Avg: 98.7, Std: 21.0). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the most recent arrival in Period 46 (ordered P42). With 5 periods remaining (P46 decision to P50 end), and a stable lead time of 4, I will maintain the current regime's parameters to ensure high service levels while managing ending inventory as the game approaches its conclusion. Using N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the stable demand pattern observed since Period 25.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 47, the average demand is 98.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.3. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game (confirmed by arrivals in P43 and P44 arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering). With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's end. Therefore, the goal is to manage the current on-hand inventory and the units already in transit (arriving in P48, P49, and P50) to satisfy the remaining 3 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 85. Expected arrivals are: P48 (72 units from P44), P49 (72 units from P45), and P50 (98 units from P46). Total available supply for the remaining 3 periods is 85 + 72 + 72 + 98 = 327 units. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~296 units (3 * 98.7). We are well-covered. I will set parameters to 'recent_N' with N=23 (Period 25-47) to reflect this stable high-demand regime, while relying on the OR backend's inventory logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1983.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 98 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 49 and 50), the primary goal is to maintain service level while minimizing ending inventory for the final period. The current 'In-transit' quantity (409 units) covers roughly 4 periods of future demand (98 * 4.1 = 402), which aligns well with the 4-period lead time. Using 'recent_N' with N=24 captures the stable higher-demand regime starting from Period 25. This will ensure the OR backend aligns with the most recent sustained demand patterns while the total pipeline (inventory + in-transit) is sufficient for the remaining horizon.

Daily Profit: $2318.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we observe that demand shifted slightly higher in the final stages of the game, with Period 49 seeing a peak demand of 144, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). The demand regime from Period 25 through Period 49 has an average of approximately 101 units per period (P25-P49 mean: 101.4), which is an increase from the previously noted mean of 98.6 reported in Period 41. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 445 units, but current stock is zero. To ensure the final period's demand is captured and to account for the slight upward drift in demand volume and volatility (Max: 144, Min: 49 in this regime), I am setting mu_hat using the last 25 samples (covering the stable high-demand period) and increasing sigma_hat to explicit 25 to protect against spikes like the one seen in Period 49. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 to 49 confirms a mean of 101.4 units/period, slightly higher than previous estimates, with sustained high volatility.
