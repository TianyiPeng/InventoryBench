Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we are at the very beginning, I will use the default lead time. Based on the provided historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the mean demand is 118. Considering the promised lead time L=4, the coverage required is for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) accounts for the recent spike (177) while averaging out the earlier periods. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture initial volatility across the small sample size. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, meaning the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), resulting in a base stock approximately equal to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, across Period 1 demand was 102 (higher than the provided historical average of ~93 for the first few samples). Since on-hand was 0, no sales occurred (sold=0). Total in-transit is 180. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the last 5 samples (from the provided list) were 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, and now Period 1 shows 102. The average is approximately 115. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand compared to the earliest samples, which will help the OR backend calculate mu_hat as (1+4+1)*115 and sigma accordingly.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Initial demand for chips(Regular) has been 102 and 147 in the first two periods, which is higher than the pre-game samples (mean ~100 vs ~118 observed). The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in Period 1 are not expected to arrive until Period 5. Total in-transit is 357 units (180 from P1 + 177 from P2). Currently, there is a total stock-out. The OR backend needs to account for the (L+1) demand window. I will set L to 'default' (4), use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the recent higher demand (avg 124.5), and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=2 to capture the early volatility. This will result in a base stock calculated as (1+4) * 124.5 + safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 5 (visibility at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 are expected and do not indicate a delay or loss yet. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 534 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first 3 periods was 102, 147, and 73 (mean = 107.3). I will use the default lead time (4) and set demand parameters based on recent performance to ensure the (L+1) window is covered. Since we have only 5 samples provided initially and 3 observed periods, N=5 for demand and volatility is appropriate to capture the baseline variance until a clearer trend emerges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Since the arrival happens AFTER the decision phase, we still see 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, the mean demand over the first 5 periods is approximately 118 units. With a promised lead time of 4, the demand across (L+1) or 5 periods is approximately 590 units. Total in-transit is currently 592 units (180+177+177+58), which aligns with coverage for the lead time. Given that on-hand is zero and we have experienced lost sales (sold=0), we must maintain steady orders to build and sustain inventory once arrivals begin. I will use the baseline promised lead time 'L' as default. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full initial history which shows a mean of 117.8. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Period 5 conclude confirms the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (Lead time = 4). No shipments are overdue yet. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [102, 147, 73, 144, 124], averaging 118. This matches the historical data provided in the prompt (~118). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 463, and on-hand is 56, total 519. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 590. Using 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand mean of ~118. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as there is no evidence of a volatility shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime mean is ~118 units/period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand history shows samples: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, 102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97. The recent mean (last 6 periods since regular sales began or were recorded in history) is approximately 114.5 units per period. In-transit inventory counts orders from P3 (177), P4 (58), P5 (51), and P6 (71), totaling 357 units. With L=4, the base stock targets coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand volatility is moderate (std dev ~27). Given profit $1 and holding cost $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand regime and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). The demand history (102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97, 64) shows moderate volatility. The most recent demand (64) is lower than the initial average, but over the last 5 periods (N=5), the mean is approximately 100.4 units, which aligns with the overall average of ~107 units. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand: 249 + In-transit: 260 = 509 units) is substantial for a 4-period lead time environment given the current demand levels. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 4, which matches the observed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-189.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4). On-hand inventory is currently high at 248 units due to the arrival of previous orders. Demand has shown a downward trend over the last 3 periods (64, 59, and 97 in P6), averaging approximately 73 units recently, compared to the initial periods. To avoid excessive holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime. I will keep the lead time L at default (4 periods) since it aligns with the observed data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to accurately reflect current volatility while the backend calculates the base stock to balance the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: Mean demand from Period 6-8 dropped to ~73 units compared to P1-P5 mean of ~118 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-175.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Based on history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1 through 5 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Demand showed a high initial regime (P1-P5 avg ~118) but has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 6. Specifically, demand for P6-P9 was 97, 64, 59, and 62, averaging ~70.5 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 9 noted this drop. With Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) being equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand. Currently, On-hand (237) and In-transit (189) totals 426 units. Given the recent demand mean of ~71, for a lead time of 4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the total requirement is approx 355 units (71 * 5). Our pipeline is currently oversupplied relative to the new demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and use the 'calculate' method for L since lead time has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Promoted lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (P5-P10) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 169 units, and in-transit inventory is 118 (orders from P7 and P9). Period 10 saw a demand spike to 139 units, contradicting the previous low-demand regime noted in Period 9 (avg ~73). Re-evaluating the demand: Period 1-5 mean was 118; Period 6-9 mean was 70.5; Period 10 was 139. The average over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 84.2. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target a base stock near the median. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent high volatility and the average demand of 84.2 units/period, ensuring we don't over-react to one spike while still acknowledging the regime change from the early high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 10 (139 units) compared to the stable Period 6-9 regime (~71 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are evaluating the demand for chips(Regular). Since Period 6, we have observed a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The demand history shows three distinct phases: an initial high (P1-P5 avg ~118), a significant drop (P6-P9 avg ~71), and a recent spike (P10-P11 avg ~131). This suggests a return to higher demand levels or increased volatility. The on-hand inventory is 126 units, with 172 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, and P11). Specifically, P8 ordered 0, P9 ordered 38, and P11 ordered 134. Given the lead time L=4, we are covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). To respond to the recent demand surge while acknowledging the previous lower regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to weight the recent periods (62, 139, 123) which averages 108 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 40 during this window). The OR backend will balance the high profit ($1) against high holding cost ($1) by aiming for a ~50% service level base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: mean demand increased from ~71 (P6-P9) to ~131 (P10-P11), indicating a recovery or increased volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was zero arrival, which is consistent with the order of 0 units placed in Period 8 (8 + lead time 4 = 12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 10, demand has shifted to a higher, more volatile regime (P10: 139, P11: 123, P12: 87) compared to the low Period 6-9 regime. The mean of the last 3 samples (P10-P12) is ~116.33. Given the Lead Time (L) is 4, the review+lead time horizon is L+1 = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 3 samples to capture this 'high volatility' regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (3) to account for the increased standard deviation observed in this period. On-hand is low (39), but we have a large pipeline coming in. Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust to the most relevant recent demand patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 10 is characterized by higher mean (~116) and higher volatility compared to the P6-P9 period (~71).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and we faced a stockout in Period 13 (demand 96, sold 77). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by recent 'conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, and P13). Note: The Period 8 order arrival is missing (expected in P12), though P9 order arrived correctly in P13. Pipeline inventory is currently 470 units (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). The demand regime shifted at Period 10 to a higher mean and higher volatility. Using the last 4 periods (P10-P13) for demand estimation, the mean is approximately 111.25. Setting L=4 (promised/confirmed), mu_hat to capture 5 periods of demand (1+L) based on this recent regime (N=4), and sigma_hat using recent volatility to ensure sufficient service level despite current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 13 due to missing P8 shipment (ordered P8, expected P12) and increased demand regime since P10 (mean ~111). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. Examining the history, the order from Period 8 (expected arrival Period 12) is lost, as it has not arrived by Period 14. The logic for arrival confirmation shows Period 9's order arrived in Period 13 (LT=4). Period 10 had an order quantity of 0, so Period 14 naturally had no arrivals. We expect Period 11's order (134 units) to arrive during Period 15, which will alleviate the current stockout. The demand regime shifted at Period 10; since then (P10-P14), mean demand is approximately 110 units. However, looking at the total history, volatility is significant. I will set L to 4 (promised and recently observed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (P10-P14) to capture the higher 110-unit average. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance in this recent regime. This should help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period (5 periods total) at the new, higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Shipment from Period 8 is confirmed lost (exceeded L+2 periods). Demand regime since Period 10 sustained at higher mean of ~110 compared to P6-P9 (~71).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observed the arrival of the Period 11 order (134 units) after 4 periods, confirming the stable lead time L=4. The Period 8 order is confirmed lost as it is now 7 periods overdue. The current demand regime starting from Period 10 shows a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units (D10:139, D11:123, D12:87, D13:96, D14:103, D15:61). I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (since Period 10) to reflect this regime. Although Period 15 demand was lower (61), the overall regime is higher than the P6-P9 slump. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 6 periods to capture the increased volatility of this regime. With on-hand inventory at 73 and 423 units in-transit (P12, P13, P14 orders), the total pipeline covers the expected lead-time demand, but we must maintain the base stock to account for the lost P8 shipment and ensure service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has 112 units on-hand and 260 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 8 is confirmed lost. Since Period 10, the demand has entered a higher-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 106 units per period (Avg of P10-P16: 139, 123, 87, 96, 103, 61, 136). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for this 5-period risk window (L+1). I will set L to 4 (promised/observed). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent_N of 7 to capture the regime since Period 10, ensuring the pipeline inventory is calculated against the 106 average. For sigma_hat, a recent_N of 7 will account for the increased standard deviation observed in this same window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 sustained with mean ~106 and increased volatility (StdDev ~27 vs ~12 in P6-P9).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 10 with a mean of approximately 107.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 27 units (Periods 10-17). Period 8 shipment (ordered P8) is confirmed lost, while more recent shipments (P9, P11, P12, P13) have arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 157. Pipeline inventory of 252 units consists of orders from P14 (87 units), P16 (12 units), and P17 (153 units). Note that the P15 order was 0 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we set L to 4. For demand parameters, we use the last 8 periods (Period 10 to 17) to capture the current active regime shifts in both mean and volatility, which provides more accurate forecasting than the long-term history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe the demand remains within the 'high-mean' regime established since Period 10. The most recent demand was 98 units, and the mean since Period 10 is approximately 105 units. The shipment ordered in Period 14 arrived in Period 18, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The shipment ordered in Period 8 is definitively lost, and the system has processed arrivals up to the Period 14 order. Current pipeline inventory (295 units) plus on-hand (146 units) equals 441 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock level of roughly 525 units (5 * 105) would be ideal. I will continue using N=9 for demand parameters (the length of the current regime from Period 10 to 18) to ensure the OR backend captures the higher mean and volatility correctly, while setting L to default (4 periods) as shipping timing is currently consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, meaning we must plan for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The demand regime since Period 10 has stabilized around a mean of approximately 107 units per period (P10-P19) with a standard deviation of about 26. The P15 order (ordered P15, L=4) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 19. Since we are at the start of Period 20, and the Period 19 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', it indicates the P15 order should arrive during Period 20's arrival phase. However, looking at the in-transit (387 units: includes orders from P16, P17, P18, P19), we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time demand and buffer against the recent volatility. I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this current regime's mean (~107) and volatility, as the period since P10 represents a distinct shift from the earlier low-demand phase (P6-P9).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 sustained with mean ~107 and StdDev ~26 (calculated over P10-P19).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we faced a partial stockout (sold 13 out of 97 demand) because on-hand inventory was nearly depleted and the arriving shipment (ordered P16, arrived P20) was only 12 units. The lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime starting from Period 10 has a mean of approximately 107 units with a standard deviation around 26. Since the current lead time L is 4, we need the pipeline inventory to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 529. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on our provided parameters and subtract the in-transit amount. Given we just experienced a stockout and the pipeline is significant, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=11, covering P10-P20) to capture the current active regime's mean and volatility while the OR backend manages the ordering logic against the 529 units already in-transit.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 10, showing higher volume and volatility compared to Periods 6-9. Over the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the mean demand is approximately 107.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25.8. I am using recent_N=12 for demand parameters to capture this current regime effectively. Although Period 15 was recorded as a skip (P8 never arrived), shipments since then (P9, P11-P14, P16-P17) have arrived with the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since P15 was skipped (ordered P11, arrived P15; ordered P12, arrived P16), and P19 concluded with a skip from P15 (nothing arrived in P19 that was ordered in P15, because P15 ordered 0), the flow is consistent with L=4. I will maintain L=4 (default) to ensure the OR backend covers the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods of demand.

There are no missing shipments currently identified; the zero arrival in Period 20 (observed at start of P21) was the result of a very small order placed in Period 16 (12 units) which arrived, and the zero arrival in Period 19 was expected as no order was placed in Period 15. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which maps to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering P10 to P22) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the historical low-demand period (P6-P9).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the inventory position for chips(Regular) is 470 units (133 on-hand + 337 in-transit). The demand regime that began around Period 10 remains stable, with the most recent 14 samples (P10-P23) showing a mean demand of approximately 105 units and a standard deviation of 27. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods, which implies our base stock must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). A base stock level targeting ~525 units (5 * 105) is appropriate to ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, which are equal to profit ($1.0 each). The recent demand in P23 was lower than average (62), but given the historical volatility (P19 was 145), we maintain parameters focused on the P10+ regime length (N=14). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P19 order in P23 conclude.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units/period. The most recent demand samples (P20-P24: 97, 88, 92, 62, 94) show a slight cooling from the earlier high-mean period, with a mean of 86.6. I will use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, while still smoothing the higher volatility observed since P10. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P21, P22, P23, P24 all arrived with lead_time=4). P15 and P20 experienced inventory pressure due to earlier lost orders and lower order quantities (P15 order was 0, P16 order was 12). Current on-hand (193) and in-transit (229) are healthy, and the OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.5 for equal profit and holding cost) will help maintain a balanced inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has remained relatively stable. Over the last 15 periods (P10-P25), the mean demand is approximately 102.3 units with a standard deviation of 26.5. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has slightly softened to an average of 84 units, but the overall volatility suggests maintaining a broader look-back for inventory safety. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 126 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) of 303 units reflects previous orders placed during slightly higher demand periods. Given the 1:1 Profit to Holding Cost ratio, the backend targeting a 50% service level (q=0.5) is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the sustained regime since Period 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we account for the current demand level and its variation while avoiding overreaction to the most recent 5-period dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 10 to Period 26) shows sustained higher mean and volatility. Calculating over these 17 samples, the mean demand is approximately 104.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 26 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recently concluded orders (P22 arrived in P26). There is one missing order from Period 15 (which should have arrived in P19), but subsequent orders (P16 onwards) are arriving as expected, suggesting a isolated loss rather than a lead time shift. The pipeline inventory (in-transit: 301) plus on-hand (64) equals 365, which roughly covers 3.5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a safe service level given the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% critical ratio for base stock, yet the backend caps it to prevent excessive accumulation), I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the current demand logic while allowing the backend to account for the consistent lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 sustained with mean ~105 and StdDev ~26 (calculated over P10-P26 evidence). Shipment from Period 15 is confirmed lost (exceeded L+6 periods).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 28. The demand regime starting at Period 10 has been sustained for 17+ periods with a mean demand of approximately 105.7 and a standard deviation of 26.2 (calculated over P10-P27). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, with orders arriving as expected after the earlier losses noted in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 34 units, with 362 units in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the entire current regime since P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand profile. L is set to default (4) as the historical lead time matches the promised lead time. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock level that covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand, adjusted for the high pipeline relative to current modest demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 29. The demand regime from Period 10 onwards remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units/period and a standard deviation of 26. In Period 28, a stockout occurred because demand (93) exceeded the available inventory (80), resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22 order arrived P26, P23 arrived P27, P24 arrived P28). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=19 (covering periods 10-28) to reflect the sustained demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=19 to capture the observed volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1), while the inventory position (on-hand 0 + in-transit 442) will be used to determine the next order. Note that the in-transit amount includes orders from periods 25, 26, 27, and 28, which are expected to arrive in periods 29, 30, 31, and 32 respectively.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has remained consistently higher with a mean around 104 units and a standard deviation around 26. Lead time is physically stable at 4 periods based on the most recent \u2018conclude\u2019 messages (P25 order arrived at P29). However, we are currently experiencing a stockout due to a combination of demand exceeding on-hand inventory and the \u2018bullwhip\u2019 effect of previous order timing. The in-transit pipeline (428 units) is quite large relative to our target stock levels. To maintain a high service level (since Profit=HoldingCost), the OR backend targets a base stock level approximately equal to (L+1)*mean + z*sqrt(L+1)*std. For L=4, mean=104, std=26, and q=0.5 (z=0), the target is ~520. With 428 in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will order ~92 units. Using recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the stable regime since P10, while L=default (4) reflects the confirmed lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system is experiencing zero on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts over the last three periods (P28, P29, P30) due to demand slightly exceeding arrivals. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 10, the demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a stable mean of approximately 105 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26 units. To navigate out of the stockout phase and account for the pipeline inventory of 443 units (orders from P27-P30), I am setting parameters based on the sustained regime since Period 10 (N=21). This will ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the most relevant recent history while the backend handles the constraints of in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has remained relatively stable. Over the last 20 periods (P11-P31), the mean demand is approximately 102.7 units with a standard deviation of 23.3. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained regime while filtering out the early volatility of P10. The promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with the most recent observation (P27 order arrived in P31), so I will use the default lead time setting. Pipeline inventory (369) and on-hand inventory (61) are currently being replenished by recent larger orders, which should resolve the recent stockout periods. Setting N=20 balances responsiveness to the current regime with enough history to provide a reliable volatility estimate.

Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P27 and P28). I will continue using recent_N data from P10 onwards (N=23) to forecast \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, which aligns with the sustained regime identified in the Carry-over Insights. Current on-hand inventory is 99, and in-transit is 310. The OR backend will compute the order based on these parameters to maintain the required service level while balancing holding costs.

The demand regime since Period 10 has remained consistently stable around a mean of ~105 units. Period 33 demand (116) aligns with this sustained regime (P10-P33 mean: 104.9, StdDev: 25.48). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods, with the P29 order arriving exactly 4 periods later in P33. Currently, there are 333 units in transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33); however, the shipment from Period 15 remains lost and should be excluded from pipeline considerations. Given the unit profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.50. I will continue to use the recent_N method based on the P10 changepoint (N=24) to capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the lost order's impact on the stock level by setting L to 4.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has remained relatively stable. Over the last 25 periods (P10-P34), the mean demand is approximately 102.6 units per period with a standard deviation of 25.1. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower at 88.6 units, but given the historical volatility and a stockout history, I will use a slightly longer window (N=15) for mean and variance to ensure adequate safety stock while reacting to the established regime. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern of the last several orders (P24 through P30 all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments currently flagged beyond the historical P8 and P15 losses. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use recent_N (N=15) for demand and volatility to capture the current stable-but-variable regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 10 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26 units. Recent demand (P31-P35) has been slightly lower (avg 86), but I will maintain the P10-P35 average to ensure service levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all successful deliveries. All recent orders from P31 back to P27 have arrived exactly on their 4-period lead time schedule, confirming the logistics channel is currently stable. In-transit inventory (322 units) and current on-hand (83 units) are sufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand at the current mean. I will use N=26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since P10, and 'default' for L to utilize the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 sustained with mean ~101 and StdDev ~26 (calculated over P10-P35). Lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains established since Period 10, showing a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31-36). Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 22 units and a pipeline (in-transit) of 350 units. The pipeline consists of orders from Period 33 (100), 34 (119), 35 (36), and 36 (95). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to calculate the base stock. By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=27, from P10 to P36), we capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=27 to reflect the increased volatility observed since Period 10.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-volatility regime since Period 10, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 21 units, and the pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 383 units. I will use N=28 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (Period 10 to Period 37) to capture the current regime's statistics accurately. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is reliable. These parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the stockout risks observed in earlier periods while accounting for the high volatility of the current regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 39. The demand regime since Period 10 has remained consistent, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26. In the most recent periods (P34-P38), demand has been slightly higher, averaging 105 units. On-hand inventory is currently low (28 units), but a shipment of 36 units (ordered Period 35) is expected to arrive during this period (visible in the next period's conclude message), followed by 95 units in the next. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38 (L=4). To maintain a service level that balances the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level through the base-stock logic, though the OR backend's cap provides a safety buffer), I will use the recent demand data from Period 10 onwards (N=29) to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, as this captures the sustained volatility and mean since the last major regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the system is at zero on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 39 (demand 68 vs. inventory 64). The in-transit pipeline is 443 units (orders from P36-P39), with the P36 order (95 units) expected to arrive during of Period 40 resolution. The demand regime starting around Period 10 remains stable with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I must ensure 'inventory on hand + in transit' covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current pipeline (443) vs. target ((1+4) * 101 = 505) indicates a deficit of approximately 62 units. The OR backend will automatically adjust the order based on this gap. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=30 to specifically capture the stable 'Post-Period 10' regime. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as it has been highly consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 41, the demand context remains stable since Period 10, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 100 units and a standard deviation of about 26. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is 91 units, while the mean over the entire regime (P10-P40) is 99 units. Lead time is highly reliable and confirmed at 4 periods across the history, with no recent anomalies recorded or observed. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 406 units (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's base-stock calculation with a 50% critical ratio (z=0) is appropriate to minimize waste while meeting average demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=31 to capture the entirety of the current stable demand regime starting from Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 37 order arriving in Period 41 as expected. The demand regime since Period 10 has been relatively stable but volatile. Recent demand in Period 41 was high (138 units), following a period of lower demand (67-68 units). The average demand over the last 30+ periods (P10-P41) is approximately 100 units with a steady standard deviation around 26. Since we have a sustained regime, I will use recent_N with N=32 to capture this stability for the OR backend. On-hand inventory is low (23), but in-transit (335) covers the next several periods of demand (approx 3.35 periods of mean demand). I set L to 'default' as the promised 4 periods aligns with consistently observed performance. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=32) to prioritize the post-Period 10 regime while maximizing data visibility for the OR backend's statistical calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with an on-hand inventory of 7 units. Reviewing the demand history from the sustained regime starting at Period 10 through Period 42, the mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of 26. Recent demand (P38-P42) shows a slight uptick (mean ~110), but the long-term regime average remains the most stable predictor. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, which is highly reliable. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 375 units (comprising orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Since lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock based on the provided mu_hat and sigma_hat; setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window (approx 505 units) while maintaining the observed volatility will allow the backend to order enough to reach the target service level. I am using recent_N (N=33, covering P10-P42) to capture the full regime profile while allowing for the specific lead time dynamics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains consistent with the shift identified at Period 10. For the most recent period range (P10-P43), the mean demand is approximately 100.8 units with a standard deviation of 25.4. Recent demand (P34-P43) shows a slightly higher mean of 105.2, but remains within the established regime's volatility. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods, with arrivals from P34 through P39 all concluding with L=4. In-transit inventory is high (384 units) relative to the 5-period demand window (approx 500-525 units), meaning the pipeline is well-filled. I will use 'recent_N' with N=34 (since P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while maintaining 'default' for L to leverage the reliable 4-period lead time. This approach balances the need for high service levels given the $1 profit/holding cost ratio (aiming for ~50% service level at the margin, but cushioned by the base-stock logic).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains focused on the post-Period 10 pattern, though recent activity shows high volatility. Period 44 saw a significant demand spike of 154 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0) despite an arrival of 58 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P40 order arrived P44). As we move towards the end of the simulation (P45 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover the remaining periods while managing the stockout risk. I will use the mean and standard deviation from the sustained regime (P10-P44) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N with N=35 covers this stable yet volatile period effectively. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 4-period history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P45) shows higher volatility and sustained demand levels around 100-110 units despite recent stockouts caused by timing gaps in arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant amount (447 units) in-transit. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P43, P44, and P45). With the profit-to-holding-cost ratio being 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially (L+1) * mu. To stabilize against the recent stockouts and high demand spikes (e.g., 154 in P44), I will use the recent demand regime since Period 10 (N=36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory pipeline accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place an order that bridges the gap between on-hand+in-transit and the target while respecting the cap.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47, with three periods remaining in the game. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand since Period 10 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26. However, very recent demand (Periods 44 and 46) has shown spikes up to 154 and 150 units respectively. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, further ordering will only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. However, the backend logic requires robust parameters for the existing in-transit pipeline (365 units) to be managed. I will maintain the current demand forecast (mu_at ~101) using a recent_N of 36 to capture the stable regime since Period 10, and use the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to capture the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 remains stable with mean ~101 and StdDev ~26. Terminal phase reached: orders placed from Period 47 onwards arrive after Period 50.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the game concludes at Period 50. Consequently, orders placed in Periods 48, 49, and 50 will contribute to holding costs if they arrive, but will not satisfy any demand within the game's timeframe. My goal now is to deplete the existing on-hand inventory (11 units) and manage the incoming pipeline (385 units) to maximize profit while minimizing terminal holding costs. The pipeline inventory already significantly exceeds the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (Period 48, 49, 50), which is approximately 300 units based on the mean of ~100 units/period. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a minimal value via the explicit method and use a very small sigma_hat to signal to the OR backend that no further ordering is required. This effectively implements a 'sell-through' strategy for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed today (Period 49) or in the final period (Period 50) will arrive after the game concludes (Period 54+). The goal now is purely to manage the liquidation of existing in-transit inventory and avoid any additional holding costs for units that cannot be sold. Current on-hand is 0, but there are 311 units in-transit. Based on the lead time of 4, the arrivals for Period 49 (ordered P45) and Period 50 (ordered P46) are the only units that can still be sold within the remaining horizon. Any further ordering is futile. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=39, covering the stable regime since P10) to maintain a realistic baseline for the OR engine, but the 'cap' mechanism and the decision to stop ordering are dominated by the fact that the simulation ends at Period 50. I set L to 'default' as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. Due to the Lead Time (L=4), any order placed now will arrive in Period 54, which is beyond the game's duration (50 periods). Consequently, any units ordered now will only incur purchase costs without contributing to revenue or fulfilling demand. Current on-hand inventory is 42, with 347 units currently in-transit from orders placed in Periods 46-49 (which will also arrive too late). To maximize total reward and avoid unnecessary holding costs or purchasing expenses for inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe, I am setting the order quantities to zero by using 'explicit' parameters with 0 values for demand and setting L to the promised 4.
