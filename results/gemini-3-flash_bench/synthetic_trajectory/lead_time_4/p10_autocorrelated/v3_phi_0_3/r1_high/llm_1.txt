Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which I treat as a representative pre-game sample) shows values of 80, 120, 120, 93, and 177, averaging 118 units per period. The product description 'chips(Regular)' suggests a stable snack category with moderate variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Therefore, I must cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 with existing stock (which is 0) and cover future demand with this order. Since current on-hand is 0, customers in Periods 1-4 will experience stockouts until the first shipment arrives. To establish a pipeline, I will order based on the average demand (118) plus a safety buffer to account for the high variance (std dev ~38) observed in history. I'll target a stock level to cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods. 118 * 5 = 590 units. I will round up slightly to 600 to ensure I capture the higher end of the observed demand range (up to 177).",

Since we are in P3, the P1 order (600 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (Resolution Phase) and be visible/usable at the start of P6. No orders have arrived yet, which is consistent with the L=4 expectation. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 0. In-transit = 600 (from P1). Current Period is P3. Demand for P3, P4, and P5 will likely be lost because inventory is 0 and no arrivals are expected until P5 concludes. e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

With on-hand inventory at 0, we must rely on incoming shipments. The pipeline (In-transit) consists of orders from P41 (80), P42 (70), P43 (120), and P44 (60), totaling 330 units. The order from P41 (80 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 45's arrival phase (available for Period 46). Since the game ends at Period 50, we only need to cover demand for Periods 45 through 50 (6 periods). Total expected demand for the remainder is ~600 units (6 periods * 100 units). Total current assets (On-hand 0 + In-transit 330) equal 330. To reach the required ~600 units, we need to order approximately 270 more. However, orders placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49. Orders placed after Period 46 will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, I will order 150 units to bolster the final periods (49 and 50) while avoiding excessive holding costs at the very end.",

As of Period 46, we are in the final stages of the game (ending Period 50). The 'Period 45 conclude' shows On-hand inventory is 0. Currently, 400 units are in-transit: orders from P42 (70 units), P43 (120 units), P44 (60 units), and P45 (150 units). Expected arrivals: P46 (P42 order: 70), P47 (P43 order: 120), P48 (P44 order: 60), P49 (P45 order: 150). Total expected pipeline for the remaining periods (46, 47, 48, 49, 50) is 400 units. Mean demand for 5 periods is ~500 units. However, since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed in Period 47 or later will not arrive in time (L=4). The order placed this period (P46) will arrive during Period 50's resolution, becoming available for Period 50's demand. To cover the remaining demand (~500 units) with current in-transit (400 units), a deficit of ~100 units exists. Ordering 100 units now ensures they arrive for the final period's demand without excessive holding cost risk at the game's end.",

Therefore, any order placed now or in the remaining periods will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or impact the final score (except to increase ending inventory/holding costs if the game were longer, though the rule is arrivals happen during the period resolution). Since the goal is to maximize R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, and no new inventory can arrive before the game concludes at P50, I must use my current on-hand and pipeline inventory to satisfy the remaining demand.
