Even if demand returns to the high-mean regime (~110-130 units/period), the current on-hand inventory of 570 plus the 100 arriving units (ordered P41, due P45) totaling 670 units, is more than sufficient to cover the final 6 periods (avg 111 units/period needed to exhaust stock). Ordering more would only increase holding costs without providing additional sales benefit. I will place zero orders for the remainder of the game to work through the current surplus.",

With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand, even at a high average of 130 per period, would be roughly 520 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 543 units is already sufficient to cover this remaining demand without any additional orders. Furthermore, since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P46) would not arrive until P50 conclude, meaning it wouldn't be available to satisfy demand in any remaining period.

The average units sold over the last three active periods is approximately 82.6 units per period. With only 4 periods remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand, even at a high-end estimate of ~130 units/period, would be around 520 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 463 is nearly sufficient to cover this entirely. Furthermore, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Any order placed now (Period 47) would not arrive until the arrival resolution of Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51), which is after the game ends.

Current on-hand inventory is 385 units. Historical demand has fluctuated but generally averaged around 100 units/period (though recently it was 41, 127, 80, and 78 in the last four active periods). With only 3 periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50), and a maximum historical demand rarely exceeding 160, the current inventory of 385 units is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand until the end of the game (~128 units per period average available).
