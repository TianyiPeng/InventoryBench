Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows an average demand of approximately 116 units per period. Since this is the initial assessment and we have a 5-period sample, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent trend. The lead time L will be set to 'default' as we have no historical arrivals to calculate actual lead time yet. The target base stock covers (L+1) periods, which is (4+1)=5 periods. Setting parameters to ensure internal stock and pipeline satisfy projected demand of roughly 580 units (5 * 116).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 158 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during Period 1+4 = Period 5. This matches the 'In-transit' status of 158 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 90). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 116 over 5 samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). Given the product category and the initial demand spike, I will use a conservative forecast until we have more than 1 period of live observation. I will set L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to estimate average demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (158 units) and P2 (151 units) are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively (since L=4). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for P1 and P2, resulting in lost sales for the demand of 90 and 79. The total in-transit is 309 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the prompt snippet) shows: P1: 75/90, P2: 138/79, P3: 134, P4: 122, P5: 111. Note: There is a discrepancy between the 'Historical Demand Data' section (P1: 75, P2: 138) and the 'Game History' (P1: 90, P2: 79). I will prioritize the Game History for the most recent observations. The mean demand across the first two concluded periods is 84.5. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Projected required base stock is approximately 5 * 84.5 = 422. Since 309 units are in-transit and 0 are on-hand, the OR backend needs to target a base stock that accounts for the 5-period horizon. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the early game scale, using N=2 based on the concluded game history.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4. According to the sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) would arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable (90, 79, 84), with a mean of 84.3. Given lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 407 in-transit. The current in-transit (158 + 151 + 98 = 407) is slightly below the 5-period requirement (approx 5 * 84 = 420). I will use the 'default' method for L as there is no evidence to change the promised lead time yet. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand stability.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 442 units in-transit (orders from P1: 158, P2: 151, P3: 98, P4: 35). Total demand across P1-P4 was 394 units, all of which were lost (sold=0) due to 0 inventory. The average demand over the 5 known samples (including user-provided P5=111) is 116 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 (all available data) to reflect the mean demand of ~116 per period, and similar for sigma. Lead time L is set to 'default' as we haven't reached the first expected arrival window yet to confirm any deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1982.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matches the promised lead time. Inventory is now flowing: we have 51 units on hand and 427 units in-transit. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [90, 79, 84, 141, 107], with an average of approximately 100.2. Period 4 showed a spike (141), but Period 5 returned closer to the mean. Since we have only 5 data points, 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation is appropriate to capture the initial behavior. For lead time, since the first arrival matches 'default', we stick with default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1898.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows that orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (arriving in Period 5 and 6 respectively), confirming the lead time L=4. Demand samples for the last 6 periods are: 90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105. There was a notable spike in Period 4 (141), but demand has stabilized around 106 units in the last two periods. The current on-hand inventory is 97, with 392 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Using L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The mean demand over 6 periods is 101, so mu_hat should be approximately 5 * 101 = 505. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history including the spike, and 'default' for lead time and sigma calculation as the system behavior is currently stable and matching promised parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1305.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for periods 1-7 (90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105, 75) averages 97.3 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and 'Period 5, 6, and 7 conclude' messages confirm that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived with an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable, I will use 'default' (promised L=4). For demand (mu_hat), the demand spike in Period 4 (141) seems like an outlier or a temporary shift, as demand has stabilized around ~100 in periods 5 and 6 and dropped to 75 in Period 7. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the last 5 samples (141, 107, 105, 75, plus Period 8's start-of-day knowledge usually includes latest samples, but since I use only conclude data, N=5 covers P3-P7). This N choice balances the spike with more recent lower demand. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on P1, P2, and P3 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 4). Total demand samples (8 periods) show a mean of ~95 units per period. Reviewing recent demand, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have a mean of 91.5, while the first 4 periods had a mean of 98.5, indicating a slight downward trend and stabilization after an initial spike in P4 (141 units). Given the Promised Lead Time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory position: On-hand (76) + In-transit (451) = 527. The mean demand for 5 periods is approximately 475 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full distribution, as the sample size is still small. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time from history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical data (Periods 1-9) consistently shows a lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand has stabilized after an initial period of volatility; specifically, the last 3 periods (Periods 7, 8, 9) show demands of 75, 79, and 88 respectively, which are significantly lower than the spikes seen in Periods 4, 5, and 6. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5-9) to capture the current lower demand regime (mean ~87.4) while still weighting recent history appropriately. This results in a mu_hat of approximately (1+4) * 87.4 = 437. For sigma_hat, N=5 provides a better estimate of current volatility than the full history. The pipeline (338) and current inventory (131) are currently sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time, so the OR backend will likely place a smaller order this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $973.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). Current inventory: 186 on-hand, 261 in-transit. Demand review: P1-P5 combined provided samples (mean ~116), but since P6, demand has cooled significantly. Last 5 periods (P6-P10) demand: 105, 75, 79, 88, 61. Mean of last 5 periods is 81.6. Sigma for this recent regime is approximately 16.5. I am setting L=4, mu_hat targeting (1+4)*81.6 = 408, and sigma_hat based on the recent volatility across the lead period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for 5 periods of demand at the current lower rate, preventing over-ordering as we have a large pipeline (261) and on-hand (186) relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased from ~116 to ~82 (-30%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is stable and confirmed at exactly 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of the last seven orders). The demand analysis shows a clear shift starting around Period 6/7. The initial five periods showed higher demand (avg ~116), whereas the subsequent five periods (P7-P11) have shown a lower average demand of approximately 74 units (75, 79, 88, 61, 69). To reflect this lower demand regime, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=4 (promised) and current N=5 will result in a base stock targeted towards (1+4)*74 = 370 units. With current on-hand of 221 and in-transit of 178 (Total 399), the OR backend will likely order minimal units, preventing overstocking while holding costs are $1/unit and inventory is currently high.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as observed in 'conclude' messages for Periods 5-12). In Period 11, a demand regime shift was noted starting around Period 6, where average demand decreased from ~116 to ~82. However, Period 12 showed a sudden spike in demand to 133, which is the highest since Period 6. This suggests that while there was a lull, volatility remains significant or a new upward trend might be starting. Current on-hand inventory is 176 and in-transit is 101, totaling 277 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last 7 samples (Periods 6-12) captures the lower average while including the recent spike (Mean \u2248 86, Std \u2248 25). I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to balance the recent regime shift with the recent volatility spike, keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 14. We have observed demand for 13 periods plus the initial 5 samples. Total demand history: [75, 138, 134, 122, 111, 90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105, 75, 79, 88, 61, 69, 133, 138]. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and most recent arrivals in P12 and P13). There was a detected demand drop around Period 6-11, but the last two periods (P12: 133, P13: 138) show a return to higher demand levels, similar to the initial sample range. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P6 to P13) which captures the lower regime and the recent spike. For mu_hat, 1+L = 5. The mean of the last 8 periods is (88 + 61 + 69 + 133 + 138 + 75 + 79 + 105) / 8 = 93.5. For sigma_hat, the variance has increased with the recent spikes, so recent_N will capture this volatility. The pipeline inventory is 199 (P10, P11, P12, P13 orders) and on-hand is 68, totaling 267. Expected arrivals for Period 14 is the order from Period 10 (39 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P12-P13, returning to levels seen in initial samples (~135 units/period) after a lower regime in P10-P11.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime has clearly shifted back to high levels (avg ~130 over the last 3 periods), recovering from the lull seen in P10-P11. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (302) consists of orders from P11 (21 units), P12 (11 units), P13 (128 units), and P14 (142 units). We expect 21 units to arrive during P15 and 11 during P16, which is insufficient to cover the demand (forecasted at 130/period). A significant order spike is needed to recover inventory levels. I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen since P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 12-14 average demand is 129 units, compared to Period 10-11 average of 65 units (+98%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout scenario with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has significantly shifted upwards starting in Period 12. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is 126.5 units ((133+138+117+118)/4), compared to the earlier low regime (P10-P11) of 65. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Because we have just experienced two periods of lost sales/stockouts (P14, P15), the OR backend needs to recognize the current high-demand regime to place sufficiently large orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean demand level (~126.5 units/period) and recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (463) consists of orders from P12 (11), P13 (128), P14 (142), and P15 (182). The P12 order (11 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P16), which is insufficient to meet expected demand (~126), making the stockout likely to continue for one more period until the P13 order (128 units) arrives in P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-demand regime starting around Period 12. Specifically, the average demand from Period 12 to 16 is 133.4 units, a significant increase from the Period 10-11 lows. Our inventory position is currently strained (On-hand: 0) due to stockouts in Periods 14, 15, and 16, where demand far exceeded arrivals from the previous low-order regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. To recover and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime accurately. The OR backend will use these to calculate a higher base stock, and given our large in-transit pipeline (596 units), the capped policy will optimize orders to maintain the target service level once these shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Periods 12-16 average 133 units (vs 65 in P10-11). Stockouts occurred P14-P16 due to preceding low-order period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 12-17) shows a significant increase to an average of 132.5 units per period, compared to the lower levels seen in Periods 9-11. We are currently recovering from stockouts in Periods 14-16 caused by low orders placed during that previous lower-demand period. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at exactly 4 periods. With only 4 units on-hand and high demand expected, the pipeline inventory (606 units) is the primary buffer covering the next 4 periods of demand plus the current period (L+1=5). To sustain this higher demand level, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 samples (P12-P17) to capture the current mean (~132.5) multiplied by (1+L=5), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the increased volatility. These parameters will guide the OR backend to maintain a base stock sufficient to satisfy the current high-demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P12-P18) has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the mid-game dip. Over the last 7 periods, average demand is approximately 133 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. While recent performance was impacted by stockouts (P14-P16) caused by low orders during the preceding demand trough (P10-P11), the supply chain is now catching up as larger orders arrive. For Period 19, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this sustained high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand period. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1850.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting around Period 12, increasing from a low regime (avg ~65) to a high regime (approx. 130-140 units/period). Periods 17-19 show demand values of 124, 138, and 102 respectively. The average demand of the last 8 periods (P12-P19) is approximately 128.8 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). To set the OR parameters for Period 20, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime while smoothing out recent volatility. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for approximately 644 units of expected demand. Inventory currently shows 88 on-hand and 530 in-transit (total pipeline 618), which is close to the expected coverage, so the OR backend will likely place a significant order to maintain the service level for the upcoming 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1668.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 12-20) shows a stabilized high-demand regime following a notable shift from the lower demand seen in Periods 9-11. The current average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 125 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~82. Recent periods (P19-P20) show a slight cooling from the peak of 161 (P16), but the mean remains much higher than the mid-game slump. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all arrivals from Period 5 through Period 20. Inventory levels are recovering from the stockouts in P14-P16, with on-hand units now at 137 and a substantial pipeline of 478 units. To maintain this recovery and meet the current regime's demand without overstocking, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this 'high regime' average and volatility, and keeping L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the high regime (Avg ~125 units/period since P12). Current inventory levels have recovered from stockouts due to high in-transit arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1525.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean since Period 12. Examining the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the average demand is approximately 120.1 units. While there was a peak in P16 (161 units), recent demand has softened slightly (90-100 range). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P17 order in P21. We have successfully recovered from the stockouts seen in P14-P16, with on-hand inventory now at 185 and 425 units in the pipeline. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for demand (N=10) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. The volatility (sigma_hat) is also calculated based on this same N=10 period to account for the variance observed during this higher demand phase.

Since Period 12, the average demand is approximately 122 units per period (P12-P22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 206, In-transit: 394) have recovered significantly as the large orders placed during the stockout recovery phase (P14-P17) arrive. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat correctly captures this sustained high-demand regime that began in P12. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=11 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 19-23) shows values of 102, 95, 90, 89, and 113. This yields an average of 97.8 units per period, which is a decline from the high regime seen between Periods 12-18 (which averaged around 133). The system currently has a healthy inventory position with 231 on-hand and 334 in-transit (orders from P20-P23), ensuring coverage for the next several periods. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods as confirmed by consistent 'conclude' messages. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' as it matches the sustained observation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this recent cooling trend in demand while maintaining enough protection against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: average demand decreased from ~133 to ~98 (-26%) and has stabilized over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2777.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a peak. In the last 6 periods (P19-P24), the average demand is approximately 107 units, down from the previous high of ~133. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P21-P24) averaged 111.75 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 168 units with 269 in-transit. The total pipeline is healthy, but since demand has settled at a lower level than the peak but remains higher than the P10-P11 lows, using the last 6 samples provides a balanced estimate (\u03bc \u2248 107) for the review+lead time window (L+1=5 periods). Sigma is derived from the same recent period to reflect current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 19: Average demand for P19-P24 is 107.3 units, representing a sustained decrease from the P12-P18 peak average of 133 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), with an average demand of approximately 117.6 units per period. While earlier observations indicated a lower average, the last two periods (P24-P25) have seen spikes to 155 and 139 units, suggesting the regime might be slightly higher than the 107 units estimated in P25. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 114 + in-transit 333 = 447) is sufficient to cover roughly 3.8 periods of demand at the recent average. To maintain service levels given the recent upward volatility, I will use a N=7 window to capture the current regime since the P19 shift, which balances the recent high demand with the preceding moderate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1827.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant variability over the last several periods. Following a lower regime starting around Period 19 (averaging ~107 units), the most recent demand samples from Period 24 to 26 (155, 139, 101) suggest a potential return to higher volatility or a slight increase in average demand (avg ~131 over the last 3 periods). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current stabilizing demand trend since Period 19, including the recent spikes, while using recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 3 periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $690.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variability recently (155 in P24, 139 in P25, but dropping to 43 in P27). Since Period 19, the average demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of roughly 35 units. Current on-hand inventory is 127, and in-transit inventory is 472 (orders from P24-P27), totaling 599 units. This pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 5.7 periods of average demand, which aligns with the (L+1) = 5 coverage logic. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the regime starting P19) to capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the older high-demand peak (P12-P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant drop in Periods 27 and 28 (43 and 10 units respectively). This likely signals a new low-demand regime or a seasonal dip. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the Period 28 conclusion (P24 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). Given the abrupt drop, using a smaller window (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) is appropriate to adjust to this potential new regime without over-reacting to a single outlier, while the 'calculate' method for lead time will leverage the consistently observed 4-period delivery. The OR backend will use these values to adjust the base stock level, protecting against over-ordering during this apparent slump and minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 27: Average demand dropped from ~107 (P19-P26) to ~26.5 (P27-P28), a decrease of approx 75%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1487.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While Period 27-28 saw extremely low demand (43 and 10), Period 29 bounced back to 89 units. The previous carry-over insight noted a potential 75% drop, but the recovery to 89 in P29 suggests the 'drop' might be localized volatility or a shorter dip rather than a sustained regime change to ~26. Recent demand history: P25 (139), P26 (101), P27 (43), P28 (10), P29 (89). Averaging the last 5 periods gives ~76 units, whereas the previous stable regime was ~107. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (204) and a large pipeline (383), and given the drop in recent average demand, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this downward shift in mean and increased volatility to avoid overstocking while demand finds a new level.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift at Period 27: Average decreased from ~107 (P19-P26) to ~76 (P25-P29) with significant individual period variance (range 10-139).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1061.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new regime characterized by high volatility and a downward trend starting around Period 27. The average demand for the most recent 12 periods (P19-P30) is approximately 100 units/period, but the last four periods (P27-P30) have averaged only 53.25 units (43, 10, 89, 71) with high variance. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is high (288 units) and in-transit is also significant (228 units). Given the high on-hand and in-transit inventory relative to the recent lower and volatile demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 samples (N=12) to capture the overall decline from the peak while accounting for recent instability. This will allow the OR backend to gradually adjust the base stock downward without overreacting to the extremely low P27-P28 outliers, while sigma_hat will be set based on the same window to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 27: Average demand decreased from ~107 (P19-P26) to ~53 (P27-P30) with high intra-period variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $711.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 27. Demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) has been 43, 10, 89, 71, and 57, averaging 54 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous average of ~107 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 372 units, and there are 171 units in-transit (orders from P28-P31). Total coverage is 543 units, which at the current demand rate of 54 units/period, covers over 10 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to target this new lower demand regime and high variance. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders due to the high pipeline and on-hand inventory relative to the new lower base stock requirement.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift at Period 27: Average demand decreased from ~107 (P19-P26) to 54 (P27-P31), a ~50% reduction with continuing high variance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant sustained decrease starting around Period 27. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged approximately 48.7 units (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22), sharply down from the previous regime average of ~107. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 384 units, which covers nearly 8 periods of the current average demand. With an additional 137 units in-transit (arriving over the next 3 periods), the system is overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime ($384 + 137 = 521$ units total pipeline vs. an expected lead-time demand of approx 244 units). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower mean and higher volatility of this current regime to prevent further over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 27. Prior to Period 27, the average demand was approximately 107 units. Since then (P27-P33), the average has dropped to approximately 51.4 units (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22, 67), representing a >50% reduction. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 370) due to previous orders placed during the higher demand regime now arriving. With a lead time consistently at 4 periods, we must set parameters to reflect this lower demand to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, albeit volatile, regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained demand decrease starting Period 27: Average demand for P27-P33 is ~51 units, compared to ~107 units in the previous regime (P19-P26).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a lower regime starting from Period 27. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P27-P34) is approximately 53 units, compared to the previous regime's average of ~107 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 308 units and in-transit inventory is 84 units (the order from P31). With the total pipeline at 392 units and demand averaging 53 units, we have over 7 periods of supply on hand, which is well above the target base stock for a 4-period lead time. No new orders have been placed since Period 31 (except the P31 order which is still in transit). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow inventory to bleed down towards a target level commensurate with the new lower demand and avoid excessive holding costs. I will continue to use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand and its current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower demand regime confirmed (P27-P34): average is 52.8 units/period, down from ~107 units previously (-50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $768.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower state that started around Period 27. Over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), the average demand is approximately 53.3 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 334 units, which is quite high relative to this demand level (it covers over 6 periods of demand). Pipeline inventory is currently 0 because no orders were placed in Periods 32, 33, or 34, and the Period 30 order was 0. A Period 31 order of 84 units just arrived in Period 35. With L=4 (stable), the target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 5 * 53 = 265 units. Since on-hand (334) alone exceeds our needs for the next several periods, maintaining a low-order posture is appropriate to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the current regime) to allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level according to the lower demand average and current volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 55 units per period over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). Although Period 36 showed a slight uptick to 90 units, the overall trend remains significantly lower than the P19-P26 average of ~107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P31 order arrived in P35, P29 order arrived in P33). We are currently in an overstocked position with 244 units on-hand and only 23 units in-transit (L=4). The holding cost is $1.00 vs. $19.00 profit, which normally suggests a high service level, but given the current inventory surplus relative to the ~55 unit demand regime, we need to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete toward a new lower base-stock target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower, albeit volatile, regime (~55 units/period) and 'calculate' for Lead Time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower demand regime (P27-P36) average is 55.2 units/period, compared to ~107 units in the P19-P26 regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a highly volatile but generally lower regime starting around Period 27, averaging roughly 55 units. However, recent demand in Period 36 (90) and Period 37 (120) suggests a potential upward shift or a return to the Period 19-26 regime (avg ~107). Current on-hand inventory is 124, with 123 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is high ($q \approx 0.95$), making it safer to over-prepare for a demand rebound than to under-order. I will use the last 11 periods (P27-P37) to capture the base of the current regime while acknowledging the recent spikes by using an explicit L=4 and recent_N for both mu and sigma to cover the (L+1)=5 period window of risk.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 36. After a sustained lower-demand period (P27-P35 avg ~53), demand in P36-P38 has jumped to 90, 120, and 95 (avg 101.7). This represents a significant increase back toward the levels seen in P19-P26. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (29 units) while in-transit is high (277 units) due to recent large orders. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P31 order arrived P35). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest demand spike and ensure service levels remain high, as the OR backend will subtract the large in-transit pipeline from the base stock to determine if more units are needed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: average increased from ~53 (P27-P35) to ~102 (P36-P38), a nearly 100% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 36. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P36-P39) is approximately 105.5 units/period (90, 120, 95, 117). The current ending on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 39 where only 29 units were sold against 117 units of demand. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by multiple arrivals up to P35). While arrivals for orders placed in P32-P34 were zero because those orders were zero, we expect the order from P36 (23 units) to arrive in Period 40. The current in-transit pipeline is 430 units. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), I am setting mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the ~105 units/period average, helping the backend recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high demand regime shift starting Period 36: average demand increased from ~53 to ~105.5 units/period (+100%). Stockout occurred in Period 39 due to low inventory levels from the previous low-demand regime orders and zero-order periods (P32-P35).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed high-demand regime that began around Period 36, with average demand approximately 105.5 units/period (P36-P40 demand: 90, 120, 95, 117, 99). The system is recovering from a stockout caused by low orders placed during the previous low-demand period (P32-P35). While arrivals have started (P36 order arrived in P40), the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (538 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To ensure we meet this higher demand and rebuild inventory levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this regime shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current volatility of this regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods of high demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high demand regime shift starting Period 36: average demand approx 104.2 units/period (P36-P40) compared to approx 53 units/period in the preceding regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-regime phase that started around Period 36. Although the demand in Period 41 (69 units) was lower than the previous four periods (range 90-120), the overall average since Period 36 is approximately 98.3 units/period. The lead time has remained consistently stable at 4 periods. Since Period 40, we have successfully recovered from stockouts with arrivals from Period 36 and 37. With 31 units on-hand and a substantial pipeline of 471 units (ordered Periods 38-41), we are well-positioned to meet demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 periods for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand regime (Periods 36-41) and use the default lead time of 4. High variance is expected given recent fluctuations, so I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 36 to a higher state, averaging approximately 100 units/period (P36-P41 avg ~100). Period 42 showed a demand of 0, which appears to be a highly volatile outlier or potentially the start of a new shift, but given the recent stockouts and the trend from P36-P41, I will treat the high-demand regime as active while acknowledging the variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P38 order arrived P42, confirming L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy (376 units in-transit). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the P36-P42 window (including the zero demand) to avoid over-ordering while maintaining protection against the recent high-demand spikes. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed (range 0 to 120).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand volatility remains extremely high within the high-demand regime; Period 42 demand was 0 following an average of ~104. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-338.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase within the confirmed high-demand regime (starting P36). While average demand for P36-P41 was ~104 units, the last two periods (P42-P43) recorded 0 demand, signaling extreme variance or a potential abrupt drop. However, history shows that the high-demand regime is often sustained, so I will calculate the forecast based on the last 8 periods (P36-P43) to balance the high starts with the zero ends (average ~78 units). Current on-hand inventory (338) plus in-transit (234) is 572 units. With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. A base stock target using a mean of 78 and standard deviation reflects the current uncertainty. The OR backend will automatically cap the order if inventory is sufficient, which it appears to be currently (572 units covers ~7.3 periods at 78/period). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has spiked significantly starting Period 42: after a high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~104), demand dropped to 0 for two consecutive periods (P42-P43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting Period 42. After a high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~104), demand fell to 0 for Period 42 and 43, then returned to a moderate level of 41 in Period 44. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 428 units due to large arrivals from orders placed during the P36-P41 peak. With in-transit inventory at 103 units, the total pipeline is 531 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent demand collapse (P42-P44 average ~13.7) versus the previous high (P36-P41 average ~104), there is a significant risk of overstocking if we continue to forecast based on the peak. I will use a recent window (N=9, covering P36-P44) to capture the mix of the high regime and the recent drop, resulting in a more balanced mu_hat that prevents excessive ordering while maintaining a safety buffer against a potential return to high demand. The backend's base-stock logic will naturally reduce the order size given the high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility confirmed: Demand dropped from ~104 (P36-P41) to avg ~14 (P42-P44), including two periods of zero demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2079.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility. Following a high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~104), demand plummeted to 0 for two periods (P42-P43) before rebounding to 41 (P44) and 127 (P45). This erratic behavior makes standard mean-based forecasting (like recent_N) unreliable for capturing the underlying distribution. Given the upcoming end of the simulation (Period 46/50) and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 50. Currently, on-hand inventory (334) plus in-transit (70) totals 404 units. With 5 periods remaining and a highly uncertain demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a broader window (N=10) to encompass both the recent zeros and the high-demand spikes (P36-P45 avg ~77), ensuring the base stock level reflects this volatility while avoiding excessive ordering that would lead to high holding costs in the final periods. L remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility continues: After a two-period drop to zero (P42-P43), demand spiked back to 127 in P45. The average demand for the period P36-P45 is approximately 77 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~104) and a subsequent two-period drop to zero (P42-P43), demand rebounded to 127 in P45 and 80 in P46. Given the game is nearing its end (Period 47 of 50) and current inventory levels (On-hand: 313, In-transit: 160) are high relative to the average demand across the last 11 periods (avg ~77.5 units), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this volatile but generally higher regime while accounting for the recent zero-demand periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect the significantly increased variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain sufficient stock for the final 4 periods without incurring excessive holding costs on a large terminal inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after two periods of zero demand (P42-P43), demand recovered to 127 (P45) and 80 (P46), bringing the P36-P46 average to ~89 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1236.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility after the shift observed around Period 36. Recent demand levels (P45-P47: 127, 80, 78) suggest a stabilization around a mean higher than the zero-demand anomaly seen in P42-P43, but lower than the P36-P41 peak (~105). Calculating the recent average since the start of this high-volatility regime (P36-P47) yields approximately 81 units per period. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (246) and significant in-transit units (222), the priority is to maintain inventory parity while buffering against the proven high variance (0 to 127 range). I will use a recent_N approach (N=12) to capture the average demand of this entire volatile period (P36-P47) to set mu_hat, and will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the currently high volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme volatility regime (P36-P47): Demand range [0, 127], average ~81 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2114.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in an extremely volatile regime that started around Period 36. After a two-period drop to zero (P42-P43), demand rebounded to 127, 80, 78, and 118 in subsequent periods. The average demand for this volatile period (P36-P48) is approximately 81.3 units, but the high variance necessitates a cautious replenishment strategy. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 128 units on-hand and 294 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 422), and considering the game ends at Period 50, we must ensure enough stock to cover the final two periods without incurring excessive holding costs. The current pipeline (422 units) already covers over 4 periods of average demand (81.3 * 4 = 325.2). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering the start of the current volatile regime at P36) balances the recent zeroes with the high demand spikes. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=13) to capture this extreme volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0) following a high demand peak in Period 49 (141 units). The system is currently in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 42, with demand ranging from 0 to 141 and an average of approximately 81 units over the last 12 periods. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P40-P47). The pipeline (in-transit) is healthy at 427 units, but due to the stockout in P49 and the high variance, I need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time + review period (5 periods total). I will use a recent_N approach for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=12 to capture this high-volatility phase (P36-P49, excluding the zeros to be safe, or simply the last 12 periods which include the regime shift). This balances the need to recover from the stockout while acknowledging the extreme demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand volatility remains extreme in the final stage (P42-P49), with demand ranging from 0 to 141. The average demand has transitioned from the high of ~105 (P36-P41) to a more volatile ~81 (P36-P49).
