Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance yet, but we are provided with 5 initial demand samples (P1-P5) for chips(Regular): [75, 138, 134, 122, 111]. The mean of these samples is 116.0, and the standard deviation is approximately 25.1. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no observation of actual lead times yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided samples. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 158 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, 0 units arrived during Period 1 arrival resolution (since L=4), resulting in 0 sales and 131 units of lost demand. On-hand remains 0, with 158 units in-transit. The demand history provided shows Period 1 as 75 (pre-game) and the current simulation report for Period 1 shows 131. Combining available samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111 from external data, though these seem to conflict slightly with the specific 'Period 1' observation of 131), the mean demand for the last few iterations is approximately 115-130. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and average the available samples for mu and sigma estimation until more game-specific data points are collected.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of the first two periods shows zero arrivals, which is expected given the lead time. Total in-transit inventory is 315 units (ordered in P1 and P2). Demand in P1 was 131 and P2 was 64, showing significant variance (avg ~97.5). Since we have no inventory on hand and the first order won't arrive until Period 5 (L=4), we must maintain a steady pipeline. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the early volatility. N=5 is chosen as the maximum available window to stabilize the mean forecast while reflecting the initial demand data.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units), Period 2 (157 units), and Period 3 (160 units) are currently in-transit (total 475 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all current demand is lost. Demand for the last 3 periods has been 131, 64, and 99 (average ~98). The historical samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show a higher average (~116). Combining all observations (8 samples), the mean is approximately 109.25. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'default' demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as we are still within the initial lead time window and haven't observed enough to confirm a sustained regime shift or lead time deviation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, we expect to see the arrival confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 630 units in transit (158+157+160+155). Demand over the first 4 periods has been 131, 64, 99, and 70 (average ~91). The user-provided samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a slightly higher mean of ~116. Given we haven't seen an arrival yet (which is expected for L=4), I will stick to the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 from the user samples (mean=116, L+1=5) to target a base stock around 580. Since we have 630 in transition, the OR backend will likely order 0 or very little this period, which is appropriate until we confirm the first arrival.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods as expected. Historical demand across the first 5 periods is [131, 64, 99, 70, 69], yielding a mean of 86.6 and a standard deviation of 27.9. Since there are only 5 data points and demand appears to be \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f lower than the initial Period 1 spike, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant history. With L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters use the full historical set to establish the baseline while confirming that the lead time is tracking with expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2294.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been {131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127}. Previous samples (pre-Period 1) were {75, 138, 134, 122, 111}. Combining these, the average demand is approximately 107.2 units per period. Regarding arrivals: The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), and Period 2 arrived in Period 6 (L=4). This confirms the promised lead time L=4 is currently accurate. Current on-hand is 119, with 315 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). Since the total pipeline + on-hand is 434, and (L+1) demand is roughly 107.2 * 5 = 536, the current stock position is slightly low. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=6 to capture the recent realized variance in this environment, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 arrival at P5 and P2 arrival at P6).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. In-transit inventory currently includes shipments from Periods 4 and 7. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but maintains a relatively stable range (mean ~98 units over the last 7 periods). Historical samples provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111) differ slightly from the actual game history demand (which shows a mix of values including 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124). Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a 7-period lookback (N=7) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the observed variance while smoothing out the lower and higher outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2730.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived exactly in P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively). Historical demand over 8 periods (131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124, 152) shows a mean of 104.5. However, there's a noticeable upward trend in the last 3 periods (127, 124, 152), averaging 134.3. Given the Lead Time is 4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3 periods for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 will better capture this increasing demand trend and ensure the base stock is responsive to higher sales levels. The current inventory (On-hand 158 + In-transit 289 = 447) is being managed against a pipeline that expects consistent arrivals from orders placed in P7 and P8.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8) confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. My available inventory is currently 0 on-hand, with 449 in-transit. These in-transit units correspond to orders from P7 (144), P8 (145), and P9 (160). Based on the L=4 pattern, the P7 order (144 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11, and the P8 order (145 units) in Period 12. Demand has shown an increasing trend recently: the last three periods recorded 124, 152, and 165 units, compared to an early average of approximately 86. Given this upward shift in demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this higher mean (approx 127/period) for the mu_hat calculation over the 5-period horizon (L+1). This ensures the base stock reflects current consumption levels and helps recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P6: average demand increased from ~85 to ~146 units over the last 4 periods (+70%).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Analysis of the history confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 to 4 arrived exactly 4 periods later (Periods 5 to 8). Since Period 5, there have been no arrivals because no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6. The next expected arrival is in Period 11 (the order placed in Period 7). The demand regime shifted at Period 6. From P6 to P10, demand values were [127, 124, 152, 165, 152], with a mean of 144. This is a significant increase from the initial average of ~85. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 638 units in transit. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture this new sustained regime of ~144 units per period across the (1+L)=5 period window.

However, there were no arrivals in Period 9 and 10 because no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6, which led to a stockout. Demand analysis confirms a regime shift starting around Period 6. Pre-shift (P1-P5) average was ~86.6; post-shift (P6-P11) average is ~134.1. While Period 11 saw a lower demand of 85, it is likely a fluctuation rather than a return to the old regime, as P8-P10 demand was consistently high (152, 165, 152). I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime, and L remains at the default promised value of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher average.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 107 units with 573 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed as a steady 4 periods (as seen in P11 and P12 arrivals). Regarding demand, there was a previously noted regime shift starting P6; however, recent demand in P11 (85) and P12 (97) suggests the high-demand peak (P8-P10) may be subsiding or stabilizing. To balance this, I'll use a recent window for mu_hat. Specifically, N=7 covers the period from P6 to P12 (demand: 127, 124, 152, 165, 152, 85, 97), resulting in an average of ~128.8 units per period. With L=4, the coverage requirement (L+1) is 5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7 allows the OR engine to react to the slightly lower recent figures while still accounting for the higher volume observed since P6. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_7' to capture the current volatility of this new regime. L is set to 4 to match consistent observed lead times.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (P7, P8, and P9 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). History shows a demand regime shift occurred around Period 6, where demand increased. However, over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has moderated somewhat (85, 97, 95) compared to the peak (P8-P10). I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture the higher demand levels seen since P6 while smoothing out the most recent dip. With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. The In-transit inventory is quite high (488), and on-hand is 172, so the parameters will likely result in a smaller order this period to prevent overstocking as previous large orders arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1559.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by all arrivals from Period 1 through Period 10 (concluding at Period 14) arriving exactly with lead_time=4. Demand analysis reveals a regime shift: Periods 1-5 averaged 86.6 units, then Periods 6-10 saw a spike to 144 units. However, the most recent 4 periods (11-14) show a stabilization at a lower average of 93.25 units. This suggests the high demand in periods 6-10 may have been a temporary surge rather than a permanent shift. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the behavior post Period 5, which includes the surge and the recent stabilization. This provides a mu_hat calculation based on (1+L) * mean(93.25 and 144 phases). On-hand inventory is healthy at 265, and with 373 in-transit, we are well-positioned to maintain high service levels while monitoring if demand stays at this new ~95 level or spikes again.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower level (~93 units) over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) following the P6-P10 spike (~144 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2067.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are observing demand patterns for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical data shows three distinct demand regimes: an initial phase (P1-P5) averaging ~87, a spike (P6-P10) averaging ~144, and a recent stabilization (P11-P15) averaging ~99. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P11-P15) had demands of 85, 97, 95, 96, and 124, which averages 99.4. Although P15 spiked to 124, the preceding four were very consistent near 95. The lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods based on multiple concluding transactions. The current inventory position is high (On-hand: 289, In-transit: 304), largely due to the large orders placed during the P10 spike arriving now. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (target cycle service level ~95% given the high profit/holding cost ratio), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilization and the slight uptick in P15. L is set to calculated as it has been consistently 4. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower volatility compared to the P6-P10 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2455.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another shift. Following a stabilization at ~93 units (P11-P14), the demand in P15 and P16 increased to 124 and 141 units, respectively. Averaging the last 6 periods (P11-P16) gives approximately 106 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 224 and in-transit is 228 (total 452). A base stock level targeting (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at ~106 units/period suggests a target around 530 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 captures the transition from the low period back toward higher demand. Setting L to default (4) as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to ~132 units over the last 2 periods (P15-P16) from the previous 4-period average of ~93.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3081.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new higher regime starting at Period 15/16. Over the last 3 periods (P15-P17), demand values were 124, 141, and 169, averaging ~145 units per period. This is significantly higher than the previous stabilization period (P11-P14) which averaged ~93. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With L=4, the backend covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=3 for mu_hat (N=max(min(3, 20), 3)) captures the current uptrend. On-hand is 130 and In-transit is 295, totaling 425 units, which is roughly 2.9 periods of current demand. Further ordering is needed to avoid stockouts as the lead time buffer (5 periods) requires approximately 725 units (145 * 5). Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation ensures the OR engine adapts quickly to the increased volatility and mean of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: 3-period average (P15-P17) is ~145 units, up from ~93 (+56%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2716.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The current regime, starting at Period 15, shows a significantly higher average demand compared to the preceding Period 11-14 window. Specifically, the 4-period average (P15-P18) is approximately 145 units per period (124, 141, 169, 146), which is roughly a 56% increase from the previous average of ~93. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Period 7 through Period 14. Currently, the SKU has 404 units in-transit and 58 on-hand. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand across 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=4 ensures we account for the volatility seen in the last four periods (+56% increase) while the OR backend balances the service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2243.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Most recently, starting at Period 15, we observed a significant increase in demand. The demand from P16 to P19 was 141, 169, 146, and 119 respectively, averaging approximately 144 units per period. This confirms the 'high demand' regime previously noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the history (observed arrivals for orders from P1 through P15). Therefore, the system should look at the last 5 periods (P15-P19) to capture this current demand level (mean ~140, std ~18), while respecting the lead time of 4. Setting L to 4 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect this recent 5-period window (N=5) will provide the OR engine with the most relevant data to maintain service levels for the (L+1)=5 period coverage window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0) because no shipment arrived. Checking the history, Period 16 had an order of 0, which explains why no shipment arrived during Period 20 (Period 16 + 4 periods lead time). Demand has remained elevated since Period 16; the average for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 138.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as observed in the most recent arrival in Period 19. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture this sustained higher demand regime and ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~693 units), which should be covered by the current pipeline of 674 plus any new order generated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: 5-period average (P16-P20) is 138.6 units, a ~49% increase from the previous baseline (~93). Stockout occurred in Period 20 due to zero order placed in Period 16.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 22. In-transit inventory is high (629 units), primarily consisting of large orders placed in Periods 18-21 (183, 176, 173, and 97 units) following the Period 16 demand regime shift and the Period 20 stockout. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime starting at Period 16 has averaged 128.5 units over the last 6 periods (141, 169, 146, 119, 118, 78). Although demand dipped to 78 in Period 21, the previous 5 periods were consistently high. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while reflecting the recent softening. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and confirmed by multiple historical arrivals.

In Period 23, we observe that the high-demand regime (averaging ~138 units) between Periods 16-20 has shifted downward. Demand for the last two periods (P21, P22) was 78 and 94 units respectively. While the carry-over insight noted a spike centered around Period 16, the most recent data suggest stabilization or a return to a lower baseline. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21, P18 order arrived P22). On-hand inventory is 153, and we have a very healthy pipeline of 511 units (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22). To avoid overstocking while respecting the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the mix of the recent surge and the current cooling (averaging ~110/period), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the variance observed during these transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand decreased to an average of 86 units (P21-P22) from the previous 5-period average of 138.6, suggesting the end of the P16-P20 spike.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a cyclical pattern. We recently exited a high-demand regime (P16-P20, avg ~138) and is currently in a lower-demand phase (P21-P23, avg ~92). The last three demand observations are 78, 94, and 103, indicating a stabilized lower level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 226 and in-transit at 404 units (from orders in P20-P23), we are well-stocked for the current demand level. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower-demand regime (P21-P23) to avoid over-ordering following the previous spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: 3-period average (P21-P23) is 91.7 units, down from the P16-P20 average of 138.6 (-34%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1201.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a spike that ended around Period 20. The average demand for the most recent regime (P21-P24) is 88.75 units (78, 94, 103, 80), which is a significant decrease from the previous average of ~139 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P20 order in P24 (4 periods). Current inventory levels are high: On-hand is 319 and In-transit is 231 (from orders in P21, P22, and P23; note that P24 had an order of 0). The pipeline (550 units) far exceeds the expected demand over the next 5 periods (roughly 444 units based on the current mean). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current lower demand regime, and L to default as the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will likely recommend a zero or very small order for Period 25 to draw down the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: 4-period average (P21-P24) is 88.75 units, down from the P16-P20 average of 138.6 (-36%).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting at Period 21. The last five periods (P21-P25) have seen demand values of 78, 94, 103, 80, and 109, resulting in a 5-period average of 92.8 units. This confirms the previously noted regime shift from the high-demand spike seen in P16-P20 (avg ~138.6). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Currently, we have 307 units on-hand and 134 units in-transit (ordered in P22 and P23). Given the promised lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, we must cover 5 periods of demand. With a mean of ~92.8, the required base stock is approximately 464 units. Our current pipeline inventory (on-hand 307 + in-transit 134 = 441) is very close to this requirement. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable lower-demand regime and keep lead time at the default promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: 5-period average (P21-P25) is 92.8 units, down from the P16-P20 average of 138.6 (-33%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1948.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 21. The 6-period average from P21-P26 is 96.6 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P20) which averaged 138.6 units. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and there is no specific calendar evidence for another spike. On-hand inventory is currently high (256 units) relative to the recent demand mean, which is why minimal ordering occurred in several recent periods. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P17 through P22). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime and stabilize the stock levels, as the OR backend's capped policy will account for the current high pipeline and on-hand inventory to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: 6-period average (P21-P26) is 96.6 units, down from the P16-P20 average of 138.6 (-30%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2415.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend after stabilizing at a lower level (~93 units) between periods 21 and 25. The last two periods (P26-P27) have seen demand climb to 116 and 137 respectively, which is reminiscent of previous spikes. The 7-period average (P21-P27) is now approximately 102.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this transition while filtering some noise. Sigma_hat is set with N=7 to reflect current volatility. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals), so I will use the default setting. The inventory position (On-hand: 188, In-transit: 197) suggests we are adequately stocked for the immediate (L+1) window, but the rising demand requires careful monitoring of the replenishment pulse.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed as stabilizing around ~93 units for 5 periods, but showing renewed growth in P26-P27 (average 126.5 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2812.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 150 units, following 137 units in Period 27 and 116 units in Period 26. This confirms a new upward demand trend (3-period average of 134 units), up from the previous baseline of ~93 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (38 units), and while the in-transit pipeline is 334 units, no order arrived in Period 28 (consistent with the zero order in Period 24). To prevent stockouts during this new high-demand phase, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to quickly capture the current demand level of ~134 units. This will ensure the base stock calculation (covering L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current growth rather than the previous lower average.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 26: 3-period average (P26-P28) increased to 134.3 units from the previous ~93 unit baseline (+44%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. The demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 116, 137, 150, and 113, averaging 129 units. This follows a Period 21-25 baseline of ~93 units. The stockout in Period 29 (sold 38 out of 113 demand) confirms the need for higher base stock levels to cover the lead time of 4 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the decision, the order must cover (L+1) periods. Using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat will capture this recent spike (129 * 5 = 645). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to account for the increased volatility observed during shifting regimes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 4-period average (P26-P29) is 129 units, up from the previous ~93 unit baseline (+39%). Stockout in Period 29 suggests current inventory levels were insufficient for this spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 122.4 units, representing a significant increase from the previous baseline. We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) because the increased demand depleted safety stocks, and recent deliveries (like the one in P30) were insufficient to meet the spike. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the inventory position is 0 on-hand and 590 in-transit, we need to maintain a high base stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand spike and its volatility, which ensures the OR backend adjusts parameters to the current higher demand level while balancing the profit vs. holding cost ratio (currently ~19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 5-period average (P26-P30) is 122.4 units, up from the previous ~93 unit baseline (~32% increase). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2157.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a baseline of ~93 up to an average of ~122 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31). Although Period 30 and 31 showed slightly lower demand (96 and 114) than the peak (150 in P28), the overall trend remains elevated compared to the P21-P25 period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 9 units on hand and a high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I need to maintain the current parameters to ensure the pipeline inventory (568 units) covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current spike regime while allowing for the recent slight softening.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 6-period average (P26-P31) is 121 units, up from the previous ~93 unit baseline (+30%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2054.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-level regime starting at Period 26. The 7-period average (P26-P32) is approximately 119.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~93 units (+28%). This confirms the sustained nature of the current regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this current demand level (119.4 * (1+4) = 597). I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility within this period. This approach will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level (approximately 5 periods of supply) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 29 and 30 while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 7-period average (P26-P32) is 119.4 units, representing a sustained ~28% increase from the previous ~93 unit baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-level regime starting at Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 33 (8 periods) is approximately 119.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~93 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 26 through 29. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units, and the pipeline inventory is 465 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). Given the consistent lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current demand regime (P26-P33) and ensure the base stock levels account for the ~120 unit average demand plus volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 8-period average (P26-P33) is 119.5 units, up ~28% from the previous ~93 unit baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is well-established, with the 9-period average (P26-P34) being 116.8 units. The last few periods (P30-P34) show a slight cooling with an average of 106.2 units, but still significantly above the previous baseline of ~93. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the P30 order arriving exactly in the arrival resolution phase of P34. Current on-hand inventory is 155, and in-transit is 407 (orders from P31, P32, P33, P34), totaling 562 units. Using recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current elevated demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This provides a base stock level designed to cover demand during the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods of forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 9-period average (P26-P34) is 116.8 units, a ~26% increase from the previous ~93 unit baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 26. The 10-period average from P26 to P35 is 113.2 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~93. However, recent demand (P34-P35) has dipped slightly to an average of 90 units. Given this recent softening, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the overall elevated regime while acknowledging the slight cooling, providing a balanced forecast for the (L+1) horizon. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P31-P35). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=10 to reflect the volatility of this higher-demand period. The current on-hand (171) and in-transit (391) units are robust, so these parameters will help the OR backend maintain a stable pipeline without over-ordering during the slight dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 10-period average (P26-P35) is 113.2 units (~22% increase from the previous ~93 unit baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1390.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that spiked at Period 26 (~130 units) has shown a clear softening over the most recent 6 periods (P31-P36), with demand values of 114, 110, 116, 95, 85, and 83. The average for these 6 periods is 100.5 units, down from the previous peak. I am setting N=6 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). Current on-hand inventory is healthy (187), and pipeline inventory (368) is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) at the current lower demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: 6-period average (P31-P36) slowed to 100.5 units from the Period 26-30 average of 122.4 units (-18%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2175.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 31. The 7-period average (P31-P37) is approximately 103.7 units, significantly lower than the preceding spike that averaged ~129 units. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P26 through P33). Currently, the inventory position is strong with 162 units on-hand and 272 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for a high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 7 periods to reflect current volatility. L is set to default (4 periods) as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: 7-period average (P31-P37) is 103.7 units, down from the Period 26-30 average of 122.4 units (-15%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2769.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. While the 7-period average (P31-P37) was ~104 units, a significant spike to 152 units occurred in Period 38. This matches patterns seen earlier in the game where demand oscillates between regimes around ~93 and ~145. Given this recent jump, I will use a recent window of 8 periods (P31-P38) to capture the average demand (~110 units) and the increased volatility to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock. This 'recent_N' approach balances the lower demand seen earlier in the block with the most recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P34 order arrived P38).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period_38 (152 units) after a period of relative stability (~100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2476.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a renewed upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P37-P39) is approximately 136.7 units, which is a significant increase from the preceding periods (~100 units). This suggests we are in a new high-demand regime, possibly similar to the spike seen around Period 26-29. Period 38 saw a demand of 152 units and Period 39 saw 134 units. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this sudden increase. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history, so I will maintain the default lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect the recent volatility over the same 3-period window.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: 3-period average (P37-P39) increased to 136.7 units from the previous ~100 unit baseline (~37% increase).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting around Period 37. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P37-P40) is 129.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100 units. A stockout risk is present given the low on-hand inventory (37 units) and the persistent high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. To address this, I will use recent_N forecasting for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=4 to capture the current spike and ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the increased demand. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient service level during this period of high consumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: 4-period average (P37-P40) is 129.5 units, up from the previous ~100 unit baseline (+29.5%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant shift. Starting at Period 37, the demand average increased to approximately 129.5 units over the subsequent four periods (P37-P40). Period 41 continued this trend with a demand of 132. However, due to a very low order placed in Period 37 (2 units) arriving in Period 41, the system stocked out. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total of 598 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual delivery observations (the 2-unit order from P37 arrived in P41). To address the current regime shift while accounting for recent volatility, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P37-P41), which captures the growth more accurately than the full history. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent 5-period window to capture the increased volatility (ranging from 109 to 152). Lead time (L) is set to the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: 5-period average (P37-P41) is 130.2 units, up from the previous ~100 unit baseline (~30% increase). Stockout in Period 41 occurred due to insufficient arrivals from P37 order.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P37-P42) is approximately 128.3 units, confirming the shift identified in the carry-over insights. A stockout occurred in Period 41 due to a very small order placed in Period 37 (2 units) arriving during a peak, leaving on-hand inventory at 10 units for the start of Period 43. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 10 units on hand and a high-demand trend, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current mean demand and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent spike rather than long-term averages, helping to rebuild inventory and minimize further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 37-42 average demand is 128.3 units, compared to the preceding period (P31-P36) average of 100.5 units (+27%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2983.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting from Period 37, with an average demand of approximately 128.3 units over the last 7 periods (P37-P43), compared to the previous baseline of ~100. We are currently experiencing stockouts (P41, P43) due to this increased demand and the impact of a very small order placed in P37 (2 units) which arrived in P41. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the priority is ensuring high service levels to avoid lost sales during this peak. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this current high-demand regime (P37-P43) while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P37-P43) confirmed: average demand 128.3 units (+27% vs previous baseline), leading to frequent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting from Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to 44 is approximately 133.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100 units. A stockout occurred in Period 43, and the inventory remains tight (ending on-hand in P44 is 29). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since we are in Period 45 with only 5 periods remaining in the game, the inventory needed must cover the remaining duration (L=4 + current period = 5). I will set mu_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 37-44) to capture this most recent sustained regime shift, which averages 133.5 units. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on these 8 samples to account for the increased volatility (demand has varied between 109 and 166 in this period). Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust to the current high-demand levels while ignoring older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: 8-period average (P37-P44) is 133.5 units (+33.5% vs previous baseline of 100). Frequent stockouts (P41, P43) confirm current buffer is insufficient for this level of demand.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a high-demand regime that started around Period 37. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P37-P45) is approximately 133 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100 units. A stockout occurred in Period 43, and with only 60 units on-hand at the start of Period 46, we are at risk if upcoming arrivals don't match this higher demand level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (most recently P41 order arriving in P45 with a lead time of 4). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (which is 4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this sustained high-demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to cover the (L+1) period window and mitigate stockout risks while account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 remains sustained: 9-period average (P37-P45) is 133 units, representing a 33% increase from the previous ~100 unit baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2630.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) is approximately 133.6 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P43-P46) show continued strength with demand consistently around 130-140 units (excluding the P43 spike of 166). On-hand inventory is low (30 units) as we enter Period 47, but a large shipment from Period 43 (108 units) is expected to arrive during this period's resolution phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to lock in this sustained higher average, providing a 5-period window (L+1) of coverage (approx 668 units total pipeline target). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for higher volatility observed in this regime (e.g., the 166 unit spike in P43).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P37-P46) confirmed: 10-period average demand is 133.6 units (~34% increase from previous baseline of 100). Pipeline needs to maintain ~670 units to avoid stockouts in this sustained spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1382.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 37, with an average demand of approximately 133.6 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46). However, the most recent demand in Period 47 was notably lower at 76 units. Despite this single-period dip, the overall trend remains elevated compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=11 (covering the high-demand regime from P37-P47) to capture the current level while including the recent dip. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to account for the volatility seen during this high-demand phase (e.g., P38 demand of 152 and P43 demand of 166).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2332.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with only two periods left (49 and 50). The sustained high-demand regime (P37-P46) showed an average of 133.6 units, but the most recent four periods (P45-P48) have shown moderate volatility (129, 140, 76, 128) with a mean of 118.25. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (L=4) will arrive in Period 53, which is past the game's horizon. Consequently, the priority is to manage current on-hand inventory (100) and in-transit units (500) efficiently. The in-transit inventory covers the remaining demand without needing significant new orders. I will set L to the confirmed actual lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 37 (average ~129), which provides a safe yet realistic projection for the OR engine's pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1698.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand has shown a slight softening over the last three periods (P47-P49 average: 100.7 units) compared to the preceding high-demand regime (P37-P46 average: 133.6 units). However, the long-term context (P37-P49) still maintains a higher average of 126 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 164 units on hand and 462 units in transit (Total Pipeline: 626), the system is relatively well-positioned. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the period from the known shift at P37 to the present) to capture the current demand level of approximately 126 units per period. I'll also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=13 to account for the increased volatility seen in this period. Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), the order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (due to the 4-period lead time), but the parameters must still be set accurately according to the instructions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 stabilized: 13-period average (P37-P49) is 126 units, up 26% from previous baseline. Recent 3-period average (P47-P49) suggests a minor softening to 101 units.
