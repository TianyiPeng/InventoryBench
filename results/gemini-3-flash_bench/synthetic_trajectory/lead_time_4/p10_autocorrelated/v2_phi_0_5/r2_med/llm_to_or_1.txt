Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to read yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no previous observation of arrivals, I will use the default method for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using the provided 5 historical samples: [75, 138, 134, 122, 111]. The mean of these samples is 116 and the standard deviation is 25.12. Using the 'default' methods will allow the backend to use these averages scaled by the lead time (1+L=5). I will set mu_hat to (5 * 116) = 580 and sigma_hat to (sqrt(5) * 25.12) \u2248 56.17 explicitly to ensure the system is seeded correctly for the initial order, as 'default' might behave unpredictably without a recorded history in the backend's specific state.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 158 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). Demand in P1 was 90, but since on-hand was 0, zero units were sold. Currently, on-hand is 0 and 158 units are in-transit. The provided historical demand samples (P1: 75, P2: 138, P3: 134, P4: 122, P5: 111) suggest an average demand of approximately 116 units per period. Since L=4, the backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the default mean (116) * 5 = 580 for mu_hat. I will use 'default' methods for now as we only have one period of actual game history, supplemented by the provided demand samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Stockouts have occurred in Period 1 and 2 because starting on-hand was 0 and initial orders have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5. Orders placed in Period 2 (153 units) are expected in Period 6. The total in-transit is 311. Historical demand for P1 and P2 was 90 and 79 respectively (average 84.5), which is slightly lower than the seed data average of ~116. However, with only 2 periods of observation, I will stick to a moderately conservative forecast. Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing back-to-back stockouts, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 period window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent available demand data (including seed samples) while L remains at the promised value of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 456 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first three periods has been relatively stable (90, 79, 84), averaging approximately 84.3 units per period. Since no orders have reached the promised lead time yet, there is no evidence to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime and 'default' for lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 456 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been consistent with a mean of 116 units (P1-P5). Since no shipments have concluded yet, I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), the recent samples (P4=122, P5=111) suggest a slight stabilization compared to the earlier jump. I will use the mean of all 5 samples (approx 116) to set the base stock for the (L+1) horizon. With L=4, L+1=5. 116 * 5 = 580. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(samples). The backend will handle the order calculation based on the pipeline (456 units).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on recent history, we finally received our first order (placed in Period 1) in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand data shows: P1: 90, P2: 79, P3: 84, P4: 141, P5: 107. Average demand over these 5 periods is approximately 100.2. However, there was a spike in Period 4 (141). Current on-hand is 51, and in-transit is 434 (orders from P2, P3, and P5). Since we are targeting a (L+1) window, we need enough inventory to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (Total 5 periods). With an average demand of ~100 per period, we need roughly 500 units in the pipeline. Currently, on-hand + in-transit = 485. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand variability including the P4 spike, and stick with the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing history: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). This confirms the actual lead time is currently matching the promised lead time of 4. Total demand samples available for analysis are Periods 1-6 (90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105). The mean demand is 101, and the standard deviation is approximately 22.3. Since L=4, the coverage required is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the full recent history after the initial stabilization. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 345 (Period 3, 5, 6 orders), and on-hand is 99. The OR backend will calculate base_stock and order accordingly to maintain the service level where q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (based on P1 and P2 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P7) are: 90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105, 75. The mean demand across these 7 samples is 97.28, with a standard deviation of 22.86. The promised lead time is 4, and arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 have confirmed the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The in-transit inventory of 304 units corresponds to orders from P5 (136), P6 (64), and P7 (104); the order from P4 was 0. The next arrival (P5's order) is expected in Period 9 resolution (visible P10 Start). Since the demand remains relatively stable around 100 per period and the lead time is steady at 4, I will use recent_N (N=7 for demand) to capture the full history since start. L will be set to the confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is 4 periods (P5 shows P1 order arrival, P6 shows P2 order arrival, P7 shows P3 order arrival). Period 8 showed no arrival because the order for Period 4 was 0 units. The promised lead time of 4 is currently accurate. Demand history (Samples + Periods 1-8) shows fluctuations but remains stable around an average of 103 units. Specifically, Period 1-8 demand: 90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105, 75, 79 (Avg ~95). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product descriptions to suggest a pivot, I will use a larger sample size (recent_N=8) to capture the trend while smoothing recent volatility. With L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 5 periods (L+1). Current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 361 units (from orders in P5, P6, P7, P8). On-hand is 90. Total position = 451. Using N=8 for demand ensures we don't overreact to the P4 spike (141) or the recent lower demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 9 consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods (confirming the promised L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 138 units, with 291 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). The demand history since our first arrival in Period 5 shows values of 107, 105, 75, 79, and 88. Prior to that, demand was 90, 79, 84, and 141. The average demand across all 9 periods is approximately 97.6 units. Given the lead time L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5. Using the mean of all samples (97.6 * 5 = 488) and the standard deviation (approx 20.6 * sqrt(5) = 46), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. The current pipeline (138 + 291 = 429) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' for demand parameters as the signal is stable with no clear regime shift or seasonality detected yet.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of the product 'chips(Regular)' shows demand has stabilized since Period 5, following an initial period of volatility. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P5-P10) is 85.83 units with a standard deviation of 17.58. This is lower than the initial sample mean of ~116 (P1-P5). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised, confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, P3, P5, and P6. Note that P4 had an order of 0, which correctly resulted in no arrival in P8. Total pipeline (in-transit) is 354, which includes orders from P7 (104), P8 (57), P9 (66), and P10 (127). The current on-hand inventory is 141. The backend needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Calculating mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the stabilized lower demand (approx 85.83 * 5 = 429) and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower mean (~86 units/period) starting Period 5 compared to initial samples.

Demand analysis suggests a regime shift occurred around Period 5. The initial samples and early periods (P1-P4) showed higher/erratic demand, whereas periods 5-11 show a stabilized lower mean. Specifically, the mean demand from P5 to P11 is approximately 83.4 units (107, 105, 75, 79, 88, 61, 69). To reflect this most recent stable regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a calculation method for L ensures we align with the observed 4-period lead time. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the L+1 period lead time window while preventing excessive holding costs as demand has trended lower.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current system state for chips(Regular) shows an on-hand inventory of 100 units and a pipeline inventory of 218 units (ordered in P9, P10, P12). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P8 order arrived in P12). Demand analysis: While an earlier insight noted a drop to ~86, the last period (P12) saw a spike to 133. However, looking at the regime starting from Period 5 (n=8), the mean is 89.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 23. This regime is more representative of current dynamics than the initial high-variance samples. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean and volatility since the first successful arrival (P5), which covers the stabilized demand period while acknowledging the recent spike and the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe demand has increased significantly over the last two periods (avg=135.5) compared to the previously stabilized mean (~86). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU is now showing signs of higher volatility or a potential holiday/seasonal shift, as demand jumped from 69 to 133 and 138. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (28), but we have a large pipeline (281) expected to arrive over the next 4 periods (ordered P10: 127, P11: 0, P12: 25, P13: 129). To account for the recent demand spike and ensure high service levels, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3 includes periods 11, 12, 13) to capture the upward trend (mean ~113.3, mu_hat = (1+4)*113.3 = 566.5). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased variance. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg increased from ~86 to ~135 (+57%) based on Periods 12-13 data.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift starting at Period 12, increasing from a mean of ~86 units to approximately 129 units based on the last three periods (P12: 133, P13: 138, P14: 117). Actual lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (38 units) and in-transit inventory is 331 units. Setting L to 4 as observed. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current higher demand regime (mean ~129.3, so expected mu_hat over L+1=5 periods is ~646). Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this new regime. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the recent spike while accounting for the full lead-time pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we faced a stockout as on-hand inventory (38) was insufficient for the demand (118). An order placed in Period 11 (0 units) explains why no arrival occurred in Period 15 conclusion. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized (confirmed by P5-P14 history). Demand has shifted significantly since Period 12. From P12 to P15, demand has been 133, 138, 117, 118, averaging ~126.5 units/period. This confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current high-demand state. Given we are at zero stock and have 479 units in-transit (orders from P12-P15), we need the OR backend to maintain a high base stock to cover the L+1 (5 periods) horizon at the new mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 12-15 mean is 126.5 units, significantly higher than the previous 86 units average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 12-16) shows a sustained shift to a higher mean (avg ~133.4) compared to the previous regime. Specifically, the last three periods (14, 15, 16) had demands of 117, 118, and 161. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since we are in a higher-demand regime and facing inventory depletion, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the shift beginning at Period 12 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This will ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock upward to meet the current demand level + safety stock for the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 units of time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $491.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained regime shift that occurred around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, demand averaged ~86 units, but the mean of the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 131.8 units (133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124). This shift is likely linked to the product category or a seasonal driver. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P10, P12, and P13 arriving exactly 4 periods later. We are currently low on stock (on-hand: 5) and have a large pipeline (572 units) due to aggressive ordering since P13. To maintain service levels for this increased demand while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this new mean (~132 units/period, targeting a safety stock for L+1=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also be set based on the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12 confirmed sustained: Period 12-17 mean is 131.8 units compared to earlier 86 units (+53%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a regime shift that began in Period 12. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P12-P18) is 132.4 units, representing a significant increase from the previous average of 86 units. The actual lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, and P14). In Period 18, we received the P14 order (177 units). We have a high in-transit pipeline (509 units) containing orders from P15 (148), P16 (144), P17 (103), and P18 (114). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (Period 12-18). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the volatility in this new period. L will remain at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12 confirmed sustained: Period 12-18 mean is 132.4 units (+54% vs previous mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 12. Since Period 12, the demand samples are: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, 102. The mean for these last 8 periods is approximately 128.8 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the current period (Review=1), the OR system needs parameters covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this updated demand regime (Period 12-19). This shift from the earlier lower mean ensures the pipeline inventory is sufficient to meet the current higher consumption rate without excessive stockouts or holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12 fully sustained through Period 19: mean stabilized at 128.8 units/period across the last 8 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift at Period 12, increasing from a mean of ~86 units to approximately 125 units. The last 9 periods (P12-P20) show demand values of 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, 102, 95, resulting in a mean of 125.1. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 139 and in-transit at 444, the total inventory position is 583. Given (L+1) = 5, and a mean demand of 125, the pipeline needs to support ~625 units. My parameters will use the recent regime (N=9) to capture the higher mean and volatility observed since Period 12, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand levels while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 12, increasing from an average of ~86 to ~128.8 units. The most recent demand samples (P12-P21: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, 102, 95, 90) result in a mean of 121.6 units per period. The standard deviation in this period is approximately 22.3 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (making the look-ahead window L+1 = 5 periods). I will set N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while smoothing recent lower observations (90, 95, 102). Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 422) + On-hand (152) = 574, which roughly covers 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a high service level is optimal. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std. With L=4 (total 5 periods), the expected demand is ~608 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 12-21 mean is 121.6 units/period (std ~22.3), showing slight softening in the last 3 periods compared to the Period 12-20 average.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 12, increasing from a mean of ~86 units to approximately ~121.6 units over the last 11 periods (Periods 12-22). However, looking at the most recent 3 periods (Periods 20-22), demand has softened slightly to an average of 91.3 units. To balance this current softening against the overall high-regime average, I will use a recent_N window of 11 periods for mu_hat to capture the post-shift behavior while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (promised = actual), so I will use the 'calculate' method. For sigma_hat, I will also use a window of 11 periods to reflect the volatility seen since the regime shift. Pipeline inventory is currently 384 units (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22), which covers expected demand during the lead time, but the backend will use these revised parameters to maintain a safe base stock level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 12-22 mean is 121.6 units/period; however, a minor softening is observed in the last 3 periods (avg 91.3).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of sustained high demand (Period 12-19 avg \u2248 129) followed by a slight softening over the last 4 periods (Period 20-23: 95, 90, 89, 113; avg \u2248 96.7). The carry-over insight from P23 noted a mean of 121.6 units for the Period 12-23 range, but current data confirms a cooling trend. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=12 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P12 to the present) to capture the overall higher average while allowing the more recent lower figures to moderate the forecast. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across almost all successful arrivals. On-hand (204) and In-transit (320) totaling 524 units provide roughly 4-5 periods of coverage at current demand levels. I'll maintain L=4 and use recent_N for both mu and sigma to adapt to the recent variability and lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for Periods 20-23 is 96.75, compared to the Period 12-19 average of 128.8 (-25%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While Period 24 indicated a 'cooling' (avg ~96 units in Periods 20-23), Period 24 itself saw a massive spike to 155 units, the second-highest recorded. This suggests the 'cooling' was temporary or variance is higher than previously estimated. The average over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 108.4 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand (136) and high in-transit (342) inventory, the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility and the mean of approximately 108 units, while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for a lead time of 4. This avoids overreacting to the single spike while acknowledging that the 90s average was potentially too low.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 24 (155 units) following a 4-period cooling phase (avg ~97); the mean for the most recent 5 periods is 108.4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $478.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 78 units with 378 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1-P3, P5-P10, and P12-P21). Demand has exhibited significant volatility recently: a cooling phase was observed between Periods 20-23 (avg ~98), followed by a sharp spike to 155 in Period 24 and 139 in Period 25. The current 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 117.2 units. Given this recent fluctuation, I am selecting a recent_N window of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to higher demand and increased volatility (std dev for P21-P25 is approx 28.5). This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to cover the current demand regime across the lead time + review period (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged at Period 24: after a cooling phase (avg 96.75), demand rose to 155 and 139, suggesting a return to a high-demand regime (~120 range).

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 24, demand has rebounded from a brief cooling phase, with the last three periods recording 155, 139, and 101 units respectively (average ~132). This indicates a return to the high-demand regime identified between Periods 12-19 (mean ~129). To account for this sustained return to higher volume and recent volatility, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the current trend (P24-P26). This balances the need for a reactive forecast while maintaining a buffer for the observed high-demand spikes. The pipeline inventory (468) is currently quite high, so the OR backend will likely scale back the order volume to manage holding costs as arrivals replenish on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebounded from cooling phase (P20-23 avg ~97) to high-demand regime starting P24 (P24-P26 avg 131.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. After a rebound to high-demand levels (avg ~131.7 in P24-P26), Period 27 saw a sharp drop to 43 units. However, looking at the broader context of the last four periods (155, 139, 101, 43), the average is 109.5 units. Given the carry-over insights showing a shift at Period 12 and another potential regime change, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current downward trend/cooling while remaining responsive. The on-hand inventory is 86 units and in-transit is 570 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods will help adjust for the recent drop in demand while the backend logic handles the safety stock via the service level q (0.8 in this case).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: after a rebound to avg ~132 (P24-P26), Period 27 dropped to 43. Current 4-period average (P24-P27) is 109.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-145.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited significant volatility in recent periods. After a high-demand phase (avg ~130) and a brief cooling phase (avg ~97), demand spiked to 155 (P24) and 139 (P25) before collapsing to 43 (P27) and 10 (P28). This suggests a sharp downward shift or an outlier phase, possibly seasonal or related to localized event cycles finishing. The recent 5-period average (P24-P28) is 89.4, but the last two periods (P27-P28) average only 26.5. Including too many past high-demand periods would lead to excessive inventory and high holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering P22-P28) to capture the descent without being overly reactive to the extreme low of 10. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (461) relative to current demand trends is high, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order sizes.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting Period 27: mean demand for P27-P28 is 26.5 units, compared to P24-P26 average of 131.7 (-80%).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility in the most recent periods, dropping from a high-demand regime (P24-P26 avg ~132) to a very low-demand phase following Period 27 (P27-P29 avg: 47.3). Specifically, Period 28 saw a demand of only 10, and Period 29 was 89. Given this 'cooling' or 'crashing' pattern after Period 27, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3 periods (P27-P29) where the mean is significantly lower (47.3) than the samples from P24-P26. This prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on the previous spike. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrival data. On-hand inventory (213) plus in-transit stock (344) is high relative to this recent demand drop, so the OR policy will likely minimize new orders to avoid holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed post-Period 27: Average demand for P27-P29 is 47.3 units, a ~64% decrease from the P24-P26 average of 131.7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime since Period 27. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 53.25 units (43, 10, 89, 71), a steep decline from the previous peaks. Simultaneously, on-hand inventory has ballooned to 308 units due to arrivals from previous high-order periods (P24-P26), and there are still 178 units in-transit (P27 order of 178). Given that current on-hand inventory + in-transit (486 units) far exceeds expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), I will set parameters to stop ordering. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and an explicit N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this transition phase. The backend policy will naturally scale down orders as the inventory position exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: mean demand dropped to ~53 units/period (P27-P30) compared to previous regimes, resulting in high inventory accumulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-201.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 27. The most recent demand samples are 43, 10, 89, 71, and 57, resulting in a 5-period average of 54.0 units/period, compared to the previously observed high-demand regime of ~132 units. The on-hand inventory has surged to 429 units, while there are 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent further overstocking while adjusting to this lower demand floor. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower mean (~54 units) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this new regime. The OR backend will see that on-hand (429) + in-transit (0) far exceeds the base stock level (calculated on a mean of ~54), resulting in 0 orders being placed until the inventory is drawn down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: mean demand dropped to ~54 units/period (P27-P31) from previous high-demand levels of ~132.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 32 is approximately 48.7 units per period (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22), which is a sharp decline from the previous high-demand phase (avg ~131-132). Currently, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 407 units due to large orders placed just before the demand crash (P23-P27) arriving now. With no units in transit and a current demand mean of ~49, the on-hand stock covers over 8 periods of demand. This far exceeds the safety stock requirements for a 4-period lead time. To prevent further holding cost accumulation, I am setting parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure no new orders are triggered until inventory levels normalize. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: mean demand dropped to ~49 units/period (P27-P32) from previous highs of ~132.

Currently, the on-hand inventory is 340 units with 0 units in transit. Given the current low demand, this inventory is sufficient to cover more than 6 periods of demand (340 / 51.4 \u2248 6.6). To maximize profit and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit/period), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period regime (N=7). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will likely recommend zero orders (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) because the current on-hand inventory already exceeds the desired base stock for the new low-demand regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 27. Prior to this, demand was roughly 130 units/period; however, since Period 27, the mean has dropped to approximately 57.5 units/period (average of P27-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 278 units with no units in transit. Given the current low-demand regime, this inventory is sufficient to cover nearly 5 periods of demand (278 / 57.5 \u2248 4.8 periods). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, and our total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) already exceeds the likely required base stock for a (L+1) horizon, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (P27-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed sustained through Period 34: mean demand dropped to ~57.5 units/period (P27-P34) from previous highs of ~132. Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new demand rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 35, the average demand is 53.2 units per period (compared to >120 previously). We have been carrying excessive inventory from orders placed during the high-demand phase (P24-P27), leading to high holding costs. On-hand inventory is currently 220 units, with 35 units in transit (due to arrive from the P35 order). Total pipeline inventory is 255. Given the current mean of ~53 units, at a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand, which is approximately 265-270 units. Since 255 is very close to this target and the engine's base-stock calculation will factor in the service level (Profit $4 / Holding $1 gives a 0.8 critical ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 samples (P27-P35) to accurately reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering while the inventory works itself down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 remains stable at a low mean: Period 27-35 average is 53.2 units/period (std ~23.5). This represents a sustained ~60% drop from the Period 24-26 rebound high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower mean since Period 27. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is 56.9 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (130) and in-transit units (93) total 223 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the total pipeline (223) is close to the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods * 56.9 \u2248 285), and earlier large orders from P27 have finished arriving, the inventory level is finally normalizing. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while maintaining the calculate method for lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $470.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 36, rising from a low mean (~53) back to a high mean (~105 over the last three periods: 90, 120, and current period trend). On-hand inventory is now low (10 units), necessitating an order update to meet the resurgent demand. There are 193 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37), with the next arrival expected in Period 39 (ordered P35, L=4). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent upward shift (avg ~90 for P35-37) while maintaining lead time L at 4 as confirmed by historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at Period 36: mean increased from ~53 to ~90 (+70%) over the last 3 periods (P35-P37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 39. Looking at the history, demand has rebounded from its low phase (P27-P35 avg ~53) to a higher level. The last four periods (P35-P38) show demand of 58, 90, 120, and 95, averaging 90.75 units per period. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 334 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, no units have arrived since Period 31 (shipments from P28-P34 appear missing or delayed). The orders from P35-P38 (35 + 58 + 100 + 141 = 334 units) constitute our current pipeline. The first of these (35 units from P35) should arrive in Period 39 resolution, meaning we will be able to sell them in Period 40. Given the recent demand rebound to ~91 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new regime and ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistent when deliveries occur.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed starting Period 36: mean demand for P36-P38 is 101.7 units, up from the P27-P35 average of 53.2 units (+91%).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has confirmed a rebound starting at Period 36, shifting from a low mean of ~53 units (P27-P35) to a higher mean of ~105.5 units (P36-P39: 90, 120, 95, 117). This represents a significant and sustained increase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 432 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, orders placed in Periods 36-39 (58, 100, 141, 133) are expected to arrive in Periods 40-43. Specifically, the P36 order (58 units) should arrive during Period 40's arrival phase, but it won't be visible until the Period 40 conclude message at the start of Period 41. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 36 confirmed: mean increased to ~105.5 units/period (P36-P39) from the previous low of ~53 units (+100%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly entered a new high-demand regime since Period 36. The average demand for the last five periods (P36-P40) is ~108 units, which is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (~53 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P35 and P36 in P39 and P40 respectively. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and the last three periods resulted in lost sales due to stockouts. I need to set parameters to recover from this stockout position and meet the sustained higher demand. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (~108) and volatility, while maintaining L at the stabilized 'calculate' value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 36 sustained: mean demand for P36-P40 is 108.2 units (std ~13.8), confirming a shift back to a higher demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 36, with an average demand of approximately 101 units per period (P36-P41: 90, 120, 95, 117, 99, 69). Although there was a dip in Period 41 (69 units), the overall trend supports a higher mean than the previous low-demand period (P27-P35). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P39-P41). On-hand inventory is low (31 units), but there is a large pipeline (447 units) due to aggressive ordering between P37-P40. We need to ensure we don't over-order while covering the lead time. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately, as the global mean is skewed by previous fluctuations. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 36 sustained through Period 41: mean demand for P36-P41 is 98.3 units (std ~18.5), confirming the high-demand regime persists despite a softer Period 41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 36, with the most recent 6-period average (P36-P41) being 98.3 units. Period 42 showed a strange demand of 0, which is likely a data outlier or a reporting delay rather than a structural shift, given the consistent recent performance around 100 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 172 units, and in-transit is 355 units (from orders in P39, P40, P41, P42). Total pipeline is 527 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * 100 = 500 units. Since current pipeline (527) covers the expected demand (500), the OR backend will likely order a small amount or nothing based on the safety stock calculation. I will use recent_N (N=7 to include the ramp-up and stabilization) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing the Period 42 outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-305.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant pattern change. Following a period of high demand (~98 units/period from P36-P41), the demand has dropped to 0 for the last two periods (P42 and P43). While 0 demand is unusual, it signals a potential cooling phase or data anomaly similar to the drop seen at Period 27. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 305, In-transit: 222), and with the lead time stabilized at 4 periods, we are well-covered for the near future. The combined inventory (527 units) far exceeds the previous high-demand regime levels (approx 100 units/period * 5 periods = 500). To avoid excessive holding costs in the face of this sudden zero-demand signal, I am reducing the demand forecast parameters to a more conservative level. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to include both the high-demand periods and the current zeros, effectively lowering the base stock target while we wait for demand to clarify.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially entered a zero/ultra-low regime starting Period 42: demand was 0 in P42 and P43, following a mean of ~98 units/period (P36-P41).

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility in recent periods.

Given the current high on-hand inventory (389 units) and in-transit units (97), the total pipeline of 486 units far exceeds any reasonable forecast for the remaining 5 periods (P45-P50), especially if the current low-demand trend (avg ~13.7 over the last 3 periods) continues. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (P42-P44) and utilizing a small N for sigma_hat to account for the sudden drop from high to near-zero demand. This will prevent further over-ordering and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Demand dropped from a mean of ~98 (P36-P41) to an average of 13.7 (P42-P44) with two zero-demand periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile. Following a period of zero/low demand (P42-P44), demand spiked again in Period 45 to 127 units. The previous carry-over insight suggested a drop to a mean of ~13.7 (P42-P44), but P45 contradicts a sustained ultra-low regime. Looking at the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 75.8 units, but this includes both the P36-P41 high-demand regime (~98 units) and the P42-P44 anomaly. Given the high on-hand inventory (310 units) and the 49 units in-transit (due P46), we are well-covered for the immediate (L+1) horizon (approx 5 periods), even if demand stays at the P36-P41 high of ~100 units/period (Target base stock ~500). I will use a conservative recent_N approach to account for the most recent volatility without over-ordering into an existing inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: after a 3-period drop (P42-P44, avg 13.7), Period 45 rebounded to 127 units, suggesting the low-demand phase was an anomaly rather than a regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. After a significant drop in Periods 42-43 (including zero demand), it rebounded to 127 in Period 45 and 80 in Period 46. This suggests that the low-demand phase was an anomaly rather than a sustained regime shift. The current mean since Period 36 (most recent high-demand regime, excluding the Period 42-44 anomaly) is approximately 98.7 units. However, including the recent volatile periods (P42-P46), the 5-period average is 49.6 but the 10-period average is 71.3. Given the endgame (Period 47 of 50) and current high inventory (On-hand: 279, In-transit: 110, Total: 389), and the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game horizon. Therefore, my goal is to manage the existing inventory to satisfy remaining demand without incurring unnecessary holding costs for units that won't sell before Period 50. With 4 periods remaining and an expected demand of ~80-100 per period, our current total stock (389) likely covers the rest of the game. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent high-volatility mean while acknowledging the game horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed sustained through Period 46; the Period 42-44 low-demand dip was temporary and demand has returned to a higher range (~80-127).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a sharp dip to zero in Periods 42-43 followed by a rebound to significant levels (127, 80, 78). The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identify that the low-demand dip was an anomaly and demand has returned to a higher range. Specifically, the average demand for the last three periods (P45-P47) is approximately 95 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (confirming L=4). With 201 units on hand and 187 in transit (totaling 388), and a lead time of 4, the system covers roughly 4.08 periods of current demand (388 / 95). Given the proximity to the game end (Period 50) and current pipeline coverage, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average to reflect the return to higher demand while acknowledging the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level appropriate for the (L+1) = 5 period outlook without over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a higher regime after a brief ultra-low dip in Periods 42-44. Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 127, 80, 78, and 118, resulting in a 4-period average of 100.75. This confirms the high-demand regime (~100 units/period) is sustained. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P42 order arrived in P46). On-hand inventory is 83, and in-transit is 365 (including orders from P46, P47, and P48). To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current decision period (total 5 periods), and accounting for current volatility (std ~23 over the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of the current sustained rebound and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 36 sustained through Period 48, despite a temporary 3-period dip (P42-P44); the mean for the most recent 4 periods (P45-P48) is 100.75 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to a high-demand regime following a temporary dip in Periods 42-44. For the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), demand levels were 127, 80, 78, 118, and 141, yielding a mean of 108.8 units. The stock-out in Period 49 (ending on-hand: 0) confirms that on-hand inventory is insufficient to meet this recovered demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 508 units in transit and 0 on-hand, I must ensure the pipeline covers the 108.8 mean demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this current regime accurately while sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the recent volatility (std ~28). The OR backend will use these to maintain the target service level.
