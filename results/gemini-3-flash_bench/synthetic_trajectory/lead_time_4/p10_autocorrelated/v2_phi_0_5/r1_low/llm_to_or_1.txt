Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial demand samples (Period 1 to 5) are 75, 138, 134, 122, 111, with a mean of 116. Since we are in the decision phase for Period 1, we have no history of arrivals or performance yet. Given high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost), overstocking is expensive. The backend formula for base stock is \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 where z* = \u03a6\u22121(profit / (profit + holding_cost)). Here, q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5, so z* = 0. This means the engine targets the median/mean. To cover the risk during the lead time (L=4) plus the current period, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods for the first period to establish a baseline based on all available samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 158 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 0 sales and 0 ending inventory for Period 1. The in-transit pipeline correctly shows 158 units. Observed demand for Period 1 was 131. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 75, 138, 134, 122, 111, with an average of roughly 116. The demand is relatively stable but we must maintain the (L+1) coverage. Since we have only one observed period of 'concluded' data and no lead time arrivals yet to adjust the lead time estimate, I will stick to 'default' for lead time and sigma, but use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the available history to capture the current demand level.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in Period 6's decision phase. Our current 'In-transit' of 324 matches the orders from Period 1 (158) and Period 2 (166). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is long, we have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a mean demand of approximately 116 units/period. The observations from the 'conclude' messages for Period 1 (131) and Period 2 (64) are within the expected range. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting to capture the current mean, and keep L at the promised default of 4 since no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest a drift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 484 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales as demand cannot be met. Historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) and game history demand (131, 64, 99) show significant variability. The mean of all 8 samples is ~109 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to react to the more recent (though lower) demand observations in the game history, while keeping L at the promised 'default' of 4 until we have arrival data to prove otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L=4 sequence: P1 order -> P5 arrival). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for the first 4 periods, resulting in lost sales. The total in-transit is 490 units (158+166+160+6). Historical demand samples are [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], with a mean of 116. Demand observed in the conclude messages for P1-P4 were [131, 64, 99, 70], which averages to 91. Given the discrepancy and early stage, I will use all 5 available demand samples to forecast. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). Mean demand = 116, Std Dev \u2248 25. Expected demand over 5 periods is 580. Current pipeline is 490. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand, using the full history (N=5) to stabilize the estimate.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time for now. Currently, we have 89 units on hand and 332 units in transit (from orders in Periods 2, 3, AND 4). Demand data for the first 5 periods (75, 138, 134, 122, 111 - provided in prompt; though history shows different realized demand: 131, 64, 99, 70, 69) shows high volatility. Using the 5 historical samples provided in the prompt (Avg: 116), the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods is approximately 580. With 421 units already accounted for (89 + 332), we need to ensure the base stock covers the lead time demand plus a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the initial variance while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as one sample is now confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 7. From 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude', we have confirmed that the actual lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The historical demand for periods 1-6 shows a mean of (131+64+99+70+69+127)/6 = 93.33 units per period. In the last 3 periods, demand has been 70, 69, and 127 (mean ~88.7). There isn't yet a strong enough signal to suggest a sustained trend change away from the general mean, although Period 6 saw a jump. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the full history since it provides a more stable estimate of the mean (93.33) and standard deviation (~29). With L=4, mu_hat represents 5 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat \u2248 5 * 93.33 = 466.65. sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5) * 29 \u2248 64.84. On-hand is 128 and In-transit is 178 (from P3: 160, P4: 6, P6: 12), totaling 306 units of pipeline inventory. The parameters will guide the OR backend to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand over the last 7 periods (131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124) averages approximately 97.7 units per period. The 5-sample historical data (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) averaged 116. Combining these, the overall average is around 105. Current On-hand (164) plus In-transit (162) equals 326 units. With L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the observed dynamic in the game) allows the OR engine to adapt to the lower recent demand (avg ~98) compared to historical samples. Sigma is set to default as we haven't seen extreme volatility beyond normal fluctuations yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals, we have consistent evidence that the actual lead time (L) is 4 periods (P5 shows P1 arrival, P6 shows P2 arrival, P7 shows P3 arrival, and P8 shows P4 arrival). The promised lead time is also 4. On-hand inventory is low (18 units) due to the small arrival in P8 (only 6 units ordered in P4). However, in-transit is 301 units, which includes orders from P6 (12), P7 (144), and P8 (145). These are expected to arrive in Periods 10, 11, and 12 respectively. Demand has shown an upward trend over the last 3 periods (127, 124, 152) compared to earlier periods (avgeraging ~80-100). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the median demand over the protection interval. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand parameters to capture the recent volume increase while maintaining stability, and default for lead time as 4 periods matches observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after heavy demand in Period 9 (165 units, only 18 sold). The systematic lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 4. I expect the order from Period 6 (12 units) to arrive during Period 10 (visible in Period 11's start), which will not be enough to satisfy demand. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 477 units, consisting of orders from Periods 6 (12), 7 (144), 8 (145), and 9 (176). Since P1-P4 all arrived exactly at L=4, I will use a lead time of 4. Demand has shown an upward trend in the last 4 periods (127, 124, 152, 165), averaging 142 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts in Periods 9 and 10 due to high demand and low arrival volume (only 12 units arrived in P10). Demand has shifted significantly: the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaged 144 units, compared to 86.6 in the first 5 (P1-P5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on receipts in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10. We have 640 units in transit (ordered P7-P10), but nothing arrived in P9, and very little in P10 because of low order quantities in P4/P5/P6. To recover and maintain a service level for the next (L+1)=5 periods, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the higher demand regime, and keeping L at the promised 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~87 (P1-P5) to ~144 (P6-P10), an increase of +65%.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift. In the first 5 periods, mean demand was approximately 87. From Period 6 to Period 11, mean demand has increased to approximately 134, with the recent 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 122. This shift was previously noted in carry-over insights. Currently, there is an inventory shortage risk as we have 59 on-hand but high recent demand. The pipeline inventory (576) is substantial, accounting for orders from P8-P11. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the higher demand regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the high-demand regime from P6-P11) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility in this new period. The lead time L is set to 4 via the calculate method as the system has consistently hit the promised lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 107 units with 467 units in-transit. Historically, we observed a lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12). Demand history shows a shift around Period 6. Mean demand for P1-P5 was 86.6, whereas P6-P10 was 144. However, the last two periods (P11 and P12) show a potential cooling or lower fluctuation with demands of 85 and 97 respectively. Given this volatility, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the higher demand regime while acknowledging the recent lower figures. L is stable at 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 7 periods (P6-P12) to reflect the current market conditions which average ~116 per period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals from P1 through P9). However, demand has undergone two distinct shifts: a significant increase observed around P6 (from ~87 to ~144), followed by a cooling off starting Period 11. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has averaged 92.3 units (85, 97, 95), which is considerably lower than the P6-P10 peak of ~144. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent deceleration and avoid over-ordering, as current on-hand inventory (188) plus in-transit (362) is quite high (550 total). The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline (550) covers the (L+1=5) period demand window, likely resulting in a small or zero order this period to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 11: mean demand decreased to ~92 from the previous peak of ~144 (period 6-10).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. Initially (P1-P5), average demand was ~87 units. Then, it surged to ~144 units during P6-P10. Most recently (P11-P14), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 93 units (85, 97, 95, 96). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as seen in the conclusion of P5 through P14. With an on-hand inventory of 267 and 187 units in-transit (ordered in P11, P12, P13), the total pipeline is 454 units. Given the formula base_stock = (1+L)*mu, and current mu being ~93 with L=4, the target stock is 465. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock downward from the previous peak, preventing excess holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the 5-period window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown distinct regimes. After an initial period (P1-P5 avg ~87) and a peak (P6-P10 avg ~144), the most recent regime starting from Period 11 has stabilized at a lower mean. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the demand values were 85, 97, 95, 96, and 124, resulting in a mean of 99.4. Although Period 15 showed a slight increase to 124, the previous four periods were very consistent around 90-100. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. My calculation for mu_hat will focus on this most recent regime (N=5) to avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand period of P6-P10. With On-hand inventory at 223 and 120 units in-transit (from orders in P12, P13, and P15), the current stock levels are healthy but need moderate replenishment to maintain the base stock level for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture current market volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the demand history reveals three distinct regimes: Period 1-5 (mean ~87), Period 6-10 (mean ~144), and Period 11-16 (mean ~106). The most recent regime (P11-P16) shows a demand stabilization after a peak, with the last two periods (P15-P16) potentially trending upwards again (124 and 141). lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5 through P16). Currently, we have 118 units on-hand and 208 in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Considering lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using the last 6 periods (N=6) for mu_hat gives an average demand of ~106.3 per period, totaling ~532 for the 5-period window. Given total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 326, the OR backend will target the base stock level derived from these parameters to mitigate stockout risks if demand continues to rise back toward the P6-P10 levels while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand moderated to ~106 (P11-P16) from the previous peak of ~144 (P6-P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a secondary regime shift starting around Period 11. Specifically, periods 11-17 have a mean demand of approximately 115.4 units, which is a decline from the peak seen in periods 6-10 (~144) but higher than the initial periods 1-5 (~87). Most recently, periods 15-17 show a significant upward trajectory (124, 141, 169). Given the date is Period 18 and no specific calendar events are provided, I will focus on the most relevant regime (P11-P17) but bias slightly toward the recent increase. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. With only 20 units on-hand and 279 in-transit, I need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time + 1 period risk (L=4 means covering 5 periods of demand). Using recent_N (N=7) for demand mean captures the current moderated regime effectively, while recent_N (N=7) for sigma captures the recent volatility better than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand moderated to ~115 (P11-P17) with a significant upward trend in the last 3 periods (P15-17 avg: 145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face a stockout (on-hand inventory: 0) following a significant demand surge. Recent demand has been: P15: 124, P16: 141, P17: 169, P18: 146, yielding an average of 145 units over the last 4 periods. This confirms a clear regime shift from the earlier moderation period (P11-P14 avg: 93). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals except for the order from Period 5 which appears lost and is now excluded from the pipeline. To address the current high demand and replenish the stockout, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods of demand (N=4) to capture the recent growth. L remains at the promised 4 periods, and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. The in-transit pipeline of 445 units (from ordered P15-P18) is substantial, but current high demand justifies maintaining a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 15: Average demand increased from ~93 (P11-P14) to ~145 (P15-P18), an increase of +56%. Shipment from Period 5 is confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Based on carry-over insights and recent history, a significant upward shift occurred at Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 144 units over the last 5 periods (P15-P19). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 608 units in transit. The shipment from Period 14 is late and potentially lost, confirming the carry-over insight that shipment Period 5 was lost. The observed lead time for successful arrivals is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~144, so 144*5=720). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent surge while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive ordering if the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Shipment from Period 14 is confirmed lost (promised L=4, current P=20, no arrival). This is the second confirmed lost shipment (Previous: Period 5).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 15) shows a significant increase to an average of approximately 144 units per period (P15: 124, P16: 141, P17: 169, P18: 146, P19: 119, P20: 118). While the last two periods show a slight dip, the average over the last 6 periods is 136. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on concluded shipments, effectively using the promised value. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility. In-transit inventory includes orders from P17 (142), P18 (166), P19 (176), and P20 (91). Shipment from P14 is confirmed lost. The current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), making the upcoming arrival from P17 (due next period) critical.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the current demand regime (starting Period 15) shows a mean demand of approximately 135.2 units (P15-P21 demand: 124, 141, 169, 146, 119, 118, 78). Although demand dipped slightly in the last period, the overall average remains higher than previous troughs. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods for completed shipments. However, we have experienced two lost shipments (P5 and P14), and currently have 533 units in-transit. A significantly large order (166 units) from P18 is expected to arrive this period (visible next period). The current on-hand inventory is 70 units. To maintain the service level across the L+1 period (5 periods) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am using N=7 for recent demand mean and standard deviation to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period arrival pattern for non-lost orders.

The recent demand history shows high volatility with distinct shifts. From Period 15-20, demand averaged ~145, but significantly dropped in Periods 21 and 22 to 78 and 94 respectively (avg ~86). Historical patterns suggest shifts between a high regime (~145) and a lower regime (~87-106). Since we are in Period 23, and the most recent few periods show a downtick, I will use a shorter window (N=8, covering P15-P22) for mu_hat to balance the recent high-demand regime with the immediate softening. This captures both the peak and the recent decline. Standard lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by recent arrivals for P17 and P18). Reliability issues (lost shipments) have occurred at P5 and P14; currently, in-transit includes orders from P19 (176 units), P20 (91 units), P21 (100 units), and P22 (37 units). Assuming the P19 order arrives this period as expected (L=4), inventory levels should remain healthy. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=12 to capture broader volatility over both regimes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 21: mean demand decreased to ~86 (P21-P22) from the previous peak of ~145 (P15-P20).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower regime following a peak. Periods 21-23 show demand values of 78, 94, and 103, averaging 91.6, confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights starting at Period 21. For Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower baseline while maintaining some coverage for fluctuations. The promised lead time (L) remains 4, and historical arrival data (Periods 5-8, 10-13, 15-17, 19-23) consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods. The carry_over_insight confirms two lost shipments (Period 5 and Period 14), which explains why the pipeline inventory occasionally doesn't result in expected arrivals. My current state (Period 24) shows 215 on-hand and 301 in-transit. With an average demand around 92 and L=4 (total protection period L+1 = 5), the target inventory (base stock) would be roughly 92 * 5 = 460. Current total inventory is 516, which is slightly above the projected need, so the OR backend will likely order a minimum or nothing to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~92 (P21-P23) from the previous peak of ~145 (P15-20).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we observe a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 21. The mean demand for the most recent 4 periods (P21-P24) is 88.75 units (78, 94, 103, 80), which is significantly lower than the previous peak regime (P15-P20) of approx 145 units. Current on-hand inventory is high at 226 units, and there is 210 units in-transit (from orders in P21, P22, P23). Total pipeline/on-hand is 436 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P20 order arrived P24). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~145 to ~89 (-38%) based on P21-P24 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-108.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 21. For the last five periods (P21-P25), demand has been 78, 94, 103, 80, and 109, resulting in an average of approximately 92.8 units per period, which aligns with previous carry-over insights of a shift to ~89-93 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent successfully concluded deliveries. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 217 on-hand and 118 in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (base stock \u2248 mean demand over lead time + review period). I will use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent, stable demand regime (P21-P25) while ignoring the previous high-demand spike (P15-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-22.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observe a steady demand regime that started around Period 21. For the last 6 periods (P21-P26), the mean demand is 96.67 (78, 94, 103, 80, 109, 116). This represents a clear shift from the previous higher-demand period (P15-P20 avg ~145). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by several recent deliveries (P21, P22, P24, P25, P26). There are no currently missing shipments based on the 4-period lead time expectation (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26 are still within the in-transit window). On-hand inventory is 138, and in-transit is 197. Given profit = holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, implying we should aim to carry a base stock roughly equal to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility since Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase. From Period 21-25, the average demand was approximately 93 units per period. However, the last two periods (P26 and P27) have shown a significant upward trend with demands of 116 and 137 respectively. This suggests the downward regime identified around Period 21 is potentially ending or shifting towards a higher mean again. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this transition, encompassing the lower period and the recent rise (P21-P27). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent successful arrivals from Periods 22 and 23. Although some shipments were lost in the past (P5 and P14), the current \u2018In-transit\u2019 of 247 units includes orders from P24-P27 (0+8+116+123 = 247). These are within the expected lead time window, so there is no immediate evidence of a new lost shipment. Setting L to 4 and mu_hat to capture the recent seven-period volume ensures we are protected against the resurging demand while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely starting Period 26: mean demand increasing from ~90 (P21-P25) to ~127 (P26-P27), signaling a potential end to the previous low-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear upward shift starting around Period 26 (Demand: P25=109, P26=116, P27=137, P28=150). The mean demand for the last 3 periods is approximately 134 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime (~89 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 28 where demand reached 150. Based on the 4-period lead time, we have 384 units in-transit (P25: 8, P26: 116, P27: 123, P28: 137). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the target service level (q) for the OR backend's inventory calculation is 0.5 (z*=0), aiming to stock the mean demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this rising trend in both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 3 periods represent the most current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments, so 'default' is selected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~90 to ~134 (+49%) based on P26-P28 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0, suggesting a service level (q) of 0.5. The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that started in Period 26. Demand for Period 26-29 was 116, 137, 150, and 113 respectively, resulting in a mean of 129. This is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (P21-P25 mean ~89). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new higher-demand phase for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current volatility (std dev for P26-29 is ~16.7). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29 (lead_time 4). Note that the order from Period 24 was zero, explaining why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 28 conclude message, rather than a lost shipment. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 539 units in-transit, which covers approximately 4.1 periods of the current average demand. The OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock target while considering the 129 mean, the 1-period review time plus 4-period lead time (L+1=5), and current pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-regime phase starting around Period 26. Historical context shows demand often cycles between low (~90) and high (~145) levels. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show a mean demand of 121.2, confirming the upward shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 29). On-hand inventory is low (20), but pipeline inventory is healthy (529). Recent arrivals (P29 conclude, P30 conclude) confirm the actual lead time is holding steady at the promised 4 periods. To respond to the sustained higher demand mean and variance while covering the L+1 window, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this current regime's characteristics. I'll maintain L at 'default' (4) as recent arrivals are consistent with this value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~89 (P21-P25) to ~121 (P26-P30), an increase of ~36%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 26, with a confirmed mean demand of approximately 121 units (based on P26-P30). Recent demand in Period 31 was 114, which aligns with this estimate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have a high 'In-transit' balance (469 units) compared to the current demand level, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally moderate ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting service levels. I am choosing N=6 for demand parameters to capture the current regime (P26-P31) specifically, ensuring the forecast reflects the recent +36% increase over the previous low-demand phase without being skewed by the very low demand seen in P21-P25.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P26-P32) shows an average demand of approximately 119.4 units per period (116, 137, 150, 113, 96, 114, 110). This aligns with the previous insight identifying a regime shift at Period 26. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P22, P23, P25, P26, P27, and P28 all arrived with L=4). However, there is a risk of lost shipments (P5 and P14 were lost previously), so I am maintaining a robust base stock. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the previous low-demand period (P21-P25). The OR backend will use these to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, which targets a 50% service level, but the 'cap' logic provides a safety buffer against lost units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 26, and since Period 31, it has stabilized at a moderate level. Based on data from Period 26 to 33, the mean demand is approximately 117 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (Periods 30-33). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the current regime from P26-P33) to capture this stable post-shift average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect current volatility. Period 33 closed with 103 units on-hand and a pipeline of 379 units (including orders from P30, P31, P32, and the new P33 order), which aligns with the expected lead time and inventory needs to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, showing an increase in mean demand compared to the Period 21-25 low. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 115, which is a stable and sustained level. Recent arrivals confirm the lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 114, and in-transit inventory is 386, which includes orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34. In-transit reconciliation: P31 (63), P32 (107), P33 (103), P34 (113). Total in-transit = 386. No shipments appears lost in the recent window. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current demand regime (P26-P34) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 since Period 30, following a high-demand phase (P26-P30, mean ~121). The last 6 periods (P30-P35) show demands of 96, 114, 110, 116, 95, 85, which averages 102.6. This suggests a transition to a moderate-demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P31 order arrived P35). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization while remaining responsive to the current trend. L is set to default (4) as shipments are arriving reliably on schedule.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~103 (P30-P35) from the previous peak of ~121 (P26-P30).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 30. Analysis of Period 30\u201336 shows a mean demand of approximately 100 units (95.5 excluding P36, but including all P30-36 it is ~100). The specific demand values are: 96, 114, 110, 116, 95, 85, 83. There is a clear downward progression in the most recent periods (85, 83), but to maintain service levels while avoiding excessive inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7). Lead time is verified at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31 arrived P35, P32 arrived P36). There are no new missing shipments since the loss in Period 14. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 periods to reflect current volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~103 since Period 30. Recent demand samples (P33-P37) are 116, 95, 85, 83, 123, which supports this stabilization. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P33 order arrived at P37). The current pipeline inventory (281 units) and on-hand (96 units) are being compared against the desired base stock for an (L+1) horizon of 5 periods. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P30-P37), providing a more responsive but stable forecast than the full history. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the inventory position for chips(Regular) consists of 57 units on-hand and 296 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods remains the stable observation from history. Analysis of recent demand indicates a regime shift at Period 36, where demand has become more volatile with a recent spike (P37 demand: 123, P38 demand: 152). The average demand since Period 36 is approximately 119.3. Given this upward volatility, I am using a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation captures this recent increase in demand and variance, preventing stockouts while balancing the holding cost which equals profit (1.0). Two historical shipments (P5 and P14) were lost, but recent arrivals (P32 order in P36, P33 in P37, P34 in P38) have been consistent with the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely starting Period 37: demand increased from ~103 (P30-P36) to ~137.5 (P37-P38), a ~33% increase with higher volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting Period 37. The mean demand for the last three periods (P37-P39) is approximately 136.3 units, compared to the previous regime (P30-P36) which averaged ~103 units. Total on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), and although there are 380 units in-transit, we must ensure the OR backend uses the most recent demand data to set a sufficiently high base stock for the upcoming lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher demand and higher volatility state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~103 (P30-P36) to ~136 (P37-P39), a 32% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 37. Analyzing Period 37-40, demand values were 123, 152, 134, and 109, resulting in a mean of 129.5 units per period. This confirms the previously noted shift from the ~103 average. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large pipeline of 524 units is in transit, including orders from Periods 37-40 (69, 128, 166, 161). The shipment from Period 37 (69 units) is expected to arrive during Period 41 resolution. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P36 order arrived P40). I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P37-P40) and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 37, currently averaging approximately 136 units (P37-P41 avg: 130, including a peak of 152). Recent demand is consistently higher than the previous Period 30-36 phase (~103). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 579 units (orders from P38-P41). These units are expected to arrive in P42 (P38 order), P43 (P39 order), etc. To maintain an appropriate base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) under the higher demand regime, I am using recent_N=5 (P37-41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend adjusts for the ~130-140 unit mean demand while considering the increased volatility seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 37 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~103 to ~130-136 (+30%) over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime at Period 37 is confirmed, with mean demand stabilized at approximately 130 units (mean P37-P42 = 128.3). While there was a slight dip in the most recent period (120), the overall context since Period 37 shows a significant increase from the previous baseline (~103). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Recent demand volatility (sigma) is also higher in this regime. I will use recent_N with N=6 (P37-P42) to capture this current regime's mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the current high-demand, high-volatility environment while maintaining the promised lead time L=4.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a stabilized high-demand phase that began around Period 37. Mean demand from Period 37 to Period 43 is approximately 135 units/period (values: 123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120, 166). The current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 468 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43 exactly 4 periods later. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean (~135) and volatility since Period 37, ensuring the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) horizon effectively during this sensitive finish to the game (Period 44 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 37 remains stable: Mean demand is approximately 135 units/period (P37-P43) with sustained higher volatility compared to the P30-P36 period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high phase that started around Period 37. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P37-P44), the mean demand is 133.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent 'conclude' messages (P40 order arrived in P44). Current on-hand inventory is 37, and in-transit is 473. The target base stock covers the demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility of this regime while filtering out older, lower demand data. Using L=default aligns with the confirmed stable delivery pattern.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 37 remains stable, with mean demand holding at approximately 135 units. Recent demand observations (P37-P45) show a range between 109 and 166 units, with a mean of 137.4. Despite the high volatility and occasional stockouts, the delivery system is performing reliably at the promised lead time of 4 periods (P41 order arrived exactly 4 periods later in P45). Currently, there is 32 units on-hand and 507 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). To maintain service levels in this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=9 to capture the full Period 37 regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'default', as the observed lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 37 to a higher level (avg ~135). In the most recent periods (P43-P46), demand has stayed consistent with values of 166, 132, 129, and 140. I will prioritize the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stable, higher demand level (approx. 138 units/period) while reflecting recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P46 by the arrival of the P42 order). Current on-hand is 0, but a large pipeline of 562 units (from periods 43-46) is in transit and expected to arrive over the next four periods. The chosen parameters aim to satisfy the current high demand while balancing holding costs through the OR backend's capped base-stock policy.

Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established at Period 37 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 131 units over the last 11 periods (P37-P47). Although Period 47 saw a lower demand of 76, this appears to be a typical outlier in a high-variance environment rather than a regime shift. In-transit inventory is high (557 units), primarily due to large orders placed in the last 4 periods (P44-P47) which are expected to arrive between Periods 48 and 51. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility while ignoring the older low-demand periods. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, essentially targeting a 50% service level modified by the backend's internal logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the penultimate step of the simulation. Current on-hand inventory is 74 units, and in-transit inventory is 441 units (comprising orders from P45-P48 balance). Comparing demand trends, the regime starting at Period 37 remains stable with an average demand of approximately 130-140 units. Specifically, for mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=12 to cover the stable regime from Period 37 onwards (Periods 37-48), resulting in an average demand of ~128.5 per period. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, this aligns the base stock logic with current consumption. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=12 to capture the higher volatility observed in this period. Since the simulation ends in Period 50, the OR backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order relative to the remaining pipeline while maintaining sufficient stock for the final resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 37, with a mean demand around 130-135 units. Recent data (P47-P49) shows slightly lower demand (76, 128, 98), but given the history of regime shifts and the goal of maintaining high service levels (profit=holding=$1.0), I will use a window of the last 13 periods (P37-P49) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 134, and the pipeline is healthy (411 units). Using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we account for the sustained higher volume and volatility observed since the shift at Period 37, while remaining responsive to the recent minor fluctuations.
