The historical demand samples (Period 1-5: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show an average demand of 116 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 158 units based on the promised lead time of 4 periods and a critical fractile of 0.5 (since Profit = Holding Cost). With a lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 580 units. The pipeline is currently empty (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit). The OR recommendation of 158 is likely low because its 'cap' mechanism smooths orders for items with long lead times to prevent over-ordering early on. However, given the zero starting inventory and 4-period lead time, ordering only 158 units now will result in severe stockouts in Periods 5 and 6. I will follow the OR's capped recommendation for this first period to establish a baseline while I observe the actual lead time and demand stability, as over-ordering early with a high holding cost relative to profit is risky.",

Inventory & Arrival Analysis: On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 9 (75 available vs. 165 demand). The order from Period 5 was 0 units, meaning no order will arrive in Period 9 conclude (observed in P10). The next arrival is expected in Period 10 (from Period 6, quantity: 29). This is very low compared to the average demand (~110-120). 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been climbing (P8: 152, P9: 165), while the historical average is closer to 110. The system is currently under-stocked. 4. OR Strategy Alignment: The OR recommendation is 106 units. Given the pipeline inventory of 459 units (29 + 139 + 132 + 159), we are currently replenishing for demand 5 periods out (P14). The current on-hand gap is severe. However, since arrivals are fixed 4 periods out, placing an even larger order now doesn't solve the immediate P10-P12 shortage; it only prevents future ones. 5.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has increased significantly. Periods 1-5 averaged ~87 units/period, while Periods 6-10 averaged ~144 units/period. The last three periods specifically (P8, P9, P10) show demand of 152, 165, and 152. \n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 0.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 42 units is based on historical averages including the early low-demand period. Given the recent demand surge to ~150 units, the current pipeline (averaging 134 units/period for the next 4 periods) is slightly below the consumption rate. To cover five periods of demand (Period 11-15) at a rate of 150/period (750 total) against a current pipeline of 536, we need about 214 units. However, the OR cap is very conservative.

The P8 order (132 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P12). 3. Demand Analysis: Since P6, demand has averaged ~134 units (127, 124, 152, 165, 152, 85). Although P11 saw a dip to 85, the general regime remains much higher than the initial periods. 4. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR recommendation is 18 units. This low value is likely due to the high in-transit total (497) relative to the OR's calculated base-stock. However, the system is just recovering from stockouts in P9 and P10. 5. Strategy: With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At an avg of ~134 units/period, target inventory is ~670.

Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 475 units, consisting of orders from P37 (10), P38 (155), P39 (159), and P40 (151).

If demand averages 132 units/period, we would need 132 * 7 = 924 units. However, we must be careful of holding costs as the game ends at Period 50.

Demand Analysis: The current demand regime is 'high' (Period 37 onwards), with an average demand of approximately 135 units (P37-P44 demands: 123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120, 166, 132). This is significantly higher than the OR baseline's implied lower historical average.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 47. In-transit consists of orders from P41 (155), P42 (135), P43 (0), and P44 (150), totaling 440. \n4. Strategy: We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current high rate (~135 units/period), the target pipeline should be roughly 675 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 47 + In-transit 440) is 487. \n5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 92 is based on a blend of all historical data, which underestimates the current demand spike. To bridge the gap toward the 675 target, a larger order is needed. Ordering ~150 units aligns with the current consumption rate and helps rebuild the safety buffer to prevent stockouts, which occurred as recently as P41.",

Our target pipeline for L+1 periods (5 periods) at an average demand of 135 is approximately 675 units (ignoring the safety factor for a moment). \n5. **OR Comparison**: The OR recommendation of 72 units is based on historical averages which likely underestimate the current sustained high-demand regime (averaging >130 recently). \n6. **Final Strategy**: To meet demand for Period 50 (the game end), we need coverage. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50. Total demand for P46-P50 (5 periods) is estimated at 675 units. Current inventory+pipeline is 508. Gap = 167 units.

This means an order placed now (P47) will arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 51 (47 + 4). Since the game ends after demand resolution in Period 50, any order placed in Period 47 or later will never arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the ending inventory for the score calculation. Current on-hand inventory is 68 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) includes orders from P43 (0 units), P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), and P46 (150 units). Expected arrivals: P47 (from P43: 0 units), P48 (from P44: 150 units), P49 (from P45: 150 units), and P50 (from P46: 150 units). Total units available to satisfy demand through P50: 68 (on-hand) + 150 (P48 arrival) + 150 (P49 arrival) + 150 (P50 arrival) = 518 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) is approximately 135 units/period * 4 = 540 units. We might face a slight stockout in Period 50 or late P49, but placing an order now cannot fix that because it arrives at P51. More importantly, ordering now would only increase 'ending inventory' after the game technically concludes for demand purposes, but would realistically just be a waste of capital or result in excessive holding costs if they were to count at P51.

Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P45 order (placed in P45) is expected to arrive during Period 49 and be available for sale. The P46 order will arrive during Period 50.

Recent demand has been in a high regime, averaging around 130-140 units. Total expected demand for P49 and P50 is approximately 260-280 units. Since 322 units are already scheduled to arrive before the game ends, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (due to 4-period lead time), which is well past the game's conclusion at Period 50.
