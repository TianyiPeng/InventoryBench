  Samples: [('Period_1', 81), ('Period_2', 97), ('Period_3', 100), ('Period_4', 84), ('Period_5', 70)]
  Mean: 86.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical arrivals to infer actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including future samples provided in context) shows a mean of 86.4 and a standard deviation of 11.97. According to the objective to cover (L+1) periods of demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available demand statistics. Since we are at the very beginning and lack specific calendar/product context (beyond 'chips'), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to establish a baseline that accounts for the L=4 lead time, resulting in a 5-period window of coverage.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory, ordered 107 units, and faced a demand of 124 units. Since the actual lead time is at least 1 (promised is 4) and we started at 0, we recorded 0 sales and 124 units of lost demand. The in-transit inventory is 107 units. The historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) give a mean of 86.4. However, Period 1's actual demand was significantly higher at 124. This suggests the initial samples might be a lower regime or there is high volatility. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the current mean of 86.4, 5-period demand is 432. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and subtract the in-transit (107). I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (the length of the provided historical samples) to establish a baseline, while the 'default' L (4) is used until we observe actual arrivals to confirm lead time drift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a total in-transit of 236 units (107 from P1, 129 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order should arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing lost sales every period because we started with 0 inventory and haven't reached the lead time arrival window yet. Demand over the first two periods was 124 and 95 (Avg = 109.5). The historical samples provided (P1-P5) show mean demand around 86.4, but the actual realized demand at P1 and P2 was significantly higher than those samples. Since we only have 2 real data points and the historical seeds, I will use a conservative average. I'll stick to the promised lead time of 4 and set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the average of all available samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95) which is ~93, 5 periods would be 465. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent higher demand specifically.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (107, 129, and 128 units respectively, totaling 364), which is expected given the lead time. The first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Demand across the first three periods was 124, 95, and 66. Excluding the seeding data (which varies from actual game history demand), the observed demand mean is approximately 95. Since we are in the early stages and on-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant pipeline inventory, I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture this early trend. With L=4, the base stock should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this, ensuring pipeline+on-hand meets the target.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning we will only see confirmation of their arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a total pipeline of 507 units (orders from P1-P4). Historically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (including the seed data provided and observed history) is approximately 86.8 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95, 66, 93). There is no strong evidence yet of a regime shift or lead time deviation, as the first order is only due to arrive this period. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using the last 5 periods (P1-P4 plus the last seed sample) to capture the most recent local variance without overreacting to the zero-sales yet (which are due to stockouts, not zero demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, we have seen 5 full periods of demand: 124, 95, 66, 93, 120 (Mean: 99.6, Std: 23). The promised lead time is 4. Period 5 conclude shows that the order placed in Period 1 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived in P5 resolution phase). This confirms the actual lead time L=4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 400 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since L=4, the P2 order should arrive at the end of P6, P3 in P7, and P4 in P8. To maintain target stock, we must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Mean demand is approx 100/period, so 500 units are needed to cover the cycle. With 400 in-transit and 0 on-hand, the pipeline is slightly short. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma (N=5) to capture the stable demand distribution observed so far.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the 6 observed periods has been 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, and 113. The average demand is approximately 101.8 units per period. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet in this generic period numbering. Currently, on-hand inventory is 16, and in-transit inventory is 410 (orders from P3, P4, and P6). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend calculation will use the statistics from all 6 periods to establish mu and sigma. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full available history while remaining sensitive to any upcoming shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend in recent periods (P5: 120, P6: 113, P7: 149), averaging approximately 127 units over the last 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 407 (Orders from P4=143, P6=139, P7=125; note P5 order was 0). Since actual lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend OR calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent increase in demand (avg ~127 per period), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat captures the volatility of this shift. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), setting L to 4 with these parameters ensures that the base stock target reflects current demand levels while the pipeline inventory (407) is deducted to determine the order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $447.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods shows a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8), which aligns with the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-8) shows a mean of approximately 109.75 units per period. Recently (last 4 periods), demand has shown a slight upward shift (mean ~125), peaking at 149 in Period 7. To ensure we cover demand during the leads time plus the review period (1+L = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full trend while remaining responsive to the recent higher volume. This provides a balance between avoiding stockouts (as seen in Periods 5 and 7) and managing holding costs for this $4 profit vs $1 holding cost item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. History confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). However, the order from Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' in Period 9's conclude message. Demand has been relatively stable across the last 9 periods (P1-P9), with an average of approximately 108.7 units and a standard deviation around 23 units. There were stockouts in Periods 1-4, 5, 7, and 9 due to lead-time delays and zero-ordering in P5. To optimize inventory for a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent history (last 9 periods) for demand and the confirmed lead time of 4 periods will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Period 9 was an anomaly where the order from Period 5 (a zero order) resulted in an 'arrived=0' message, which is expected. The order from Period 6 arrived in Period 10, maintaining the L=4 pattern. Demand has fluctuated between 66 and 149, with a mean of approximately 110.7 over the last 10 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly higher (mean ~119). I will use L=4 (promised) and recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline variability while ensuring we cover the lead time + review period (1+4=5 periods). Current on-hand is low (12), but in-transit (450) is substantial, covering nearly 4 periods of average demand. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a 5-period demand window.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 11 (P7 order arrived in P11). Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 112 units across the last 11 periods. However, recent demand (P5-P11) shows a slight upward trend, averaging 122.5 units per period. Notably, the order from Period 5 (which should have arrived in Period 9) is missing, leading to a stockout in Period 9. The current pipeline inventory is 460 units (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), which is approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the 125 units/period rate. To ensure we recover from the stockout risk and account for the slightly higher recent demand, I am using recent_N=6 to capture the current demand level. This sets a higher buffer to protect against the lost Period 5 shipment impact and maintains service levels.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 5 (lead time 4) is confirmed lost; it did not arrive by Period 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time (L) is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8 arrivals). Note: The order from Period 5 was confirmed lost as it did not arrive by P11. Currently, on-hand is 67 and in-transit is 452. The in-transit includes orders from P9 (148), P10 (18), P11 (135), and P12 (151). The P9 order is expected to arrive during P13 (resolving in the P13 conclude message). Average demand over the 12 periods is approximately 111.25 units. Since there is no clear evidence of a significant demand shift (values fluctuating between 66 and 149), I will use the 'default' method for lead time (L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=12 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate base-stock for 5 periods (L+1). This ensures we maintain a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the demand for chips(Regular) appears stable. The mean demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 108 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 109.8 units, suggesting no major regime shift. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 consistently arrive with an actual lead time of 4 periods. The shipment from Period 5 is confirmed lost. Currently, inventory is healthy with 123 units on-hand and 383 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). Since L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5 samples for mu_hat (approx 110/period) and sigma_hat provides a localized estimate of demand and volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock as roughly 110 * 5 = 550 plus safety stock, then subtract the 383 in-transit and 123 on-hand to determine the order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4. Observation of completed arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised value. The order from Period 5 is definitively lost. Demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (mean ~88 vs historical ~100), but given the product (regular chips) and the lack of specific calendar date information, I will use a slightly more responsive average. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand level while smoothing volatility. For lead time, I'll use the 'calculate' method as it aligns with the consistent 4-period observations. Pipeline inventory is currently 441, which includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14. An order placed now (P15) arrives in P19. Inventory on-hand (80) plus pipeline (441) must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~90, 5 periods require ~450 units. We are currently adequately covered, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a minor shift. In the first 11 periods, the average demand was approximately 115 units. In the last 4 periods (P12-P15), it has decreased to an average of 82.5 units. Given the inventory level (on-hand 137) and the significant pipeline (386 units), we need to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory to cover the lead time. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (except for a lost shipment in Period 5). The pipeline currently contains orders from P12 (151), P13 (79), P14 (76), and P15 (80). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the lower demand trend and ensure the base stock calculation reflects reality. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to match the current volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods as it has proven stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: average decreased from ~115 to ~83 (-28%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 12) shows a significant decrease in mean demand compared to the initial periods. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand is 80.4, compared to the earlier average of ~115 (-30%). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Current on-hand inventory (216) and in-transit units (235) are relatively high relative to the new demand level, so the OR backend should naturally reduce or skip ordering to minimize holding costs while the lower demand regime persists. Using N=5 for sigma_hat also helps adjust the safety stock for the current variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $315.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12. Calculating the average demand from Period 12 to 17 (99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122) gives a mean of 87.3 per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target window is L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat will capture this shift while smoothing the recent spike in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory (173) and in-transit units (156) provide a significant buffer (329 total) against the current forecast (87.3 * 5 = 436.5). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods since the initial resolution, and the lost shipment from Period 5 is long past. No new parameters are needed to adjust for volatility beyond standard calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12, though recent samples (Periods 17-18) show a slight uptick (122 and 107). The average demand from Period 12 to 18 is approximately 90 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 142 units, and in-transit is 204 units. Orders from Periods 15 and 18 are expected to arrive in Periods 19 and 22 respectively. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we target a high service level. I will use the recent demand regime (last 7 periods) to calibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). This approach accounts for the recent slight increase in demand while respecting the overall lower regime detected earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 12: Average demand from Period 12-18 is 90 units, a recovery from the initial drop to 83, but still below the original ~115 level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20. The history shows two distinct demand regimes: Period 1-11 with a mean of ~115 and Period 12-19 with a mean of ~90. Recent demand (P12-P19) has stabilized around an average of 90 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P15 order arrived at P19), with the exception of one lost shipment from P5. On-hand inventory is 139 units, and in-transit is 250 units (from P18, P19 orders). Total pipeline + on-hand is 389 units. Given the promised and observed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 90 = 450 units. Currently, we have 389, suggesting the OR backend will order around 60 units to reach the base stock level. Setting L to 4 reflects the consistent observed behavior. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=8, covering P12-P19) to reflect the lower stable demand regime, and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture the current volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 39 units, and 345 units are in-transit. Based on historical data, specifically since the demand regime shift at Period 12, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 90 units per period (Periods 12-20 average is ~87.4). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistent except for one lost shipment in Period 5. The total in-transit units (345) are composed of orders from Period 18 (124), Period 19 (126), and Period 20 (95). The order from Period 16 was 0 units, and the order from Period 17 was 0 units, explaining the 'arrived=0' in the Period 20 conclude message (arrival for P16) and the expected 'arrived=0' in the upcoming Period 21 conclude message (arrival for P17). I will set L to the promised 4 periods using the 'default' method. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (Periods 12-20) to reflect the stabilized post-shift demand regime, which averages ~87.4 per period. Total mu_hat will be (1+4) * 87.4 = 437. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, demand was higher (~115). From Period 12 to 21, the mean demand is approximately 88.5 units per period. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (Periods 12-21). Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 4. Observations confirm this: P1->P5 (L=4), P2->P6 (L=4), P3->P7 (L=4), P4->P8 (L=4), P6->P10 (L=4), P7->P11 (L=4), P8->P12 (L=4), P9->P13 (L=4), P10->P14 (L=4), P11->P15 (L=4), P12->P16 (L=4), P13->P17 (L=4), P14->P18 (L=4), P15->P19 (L=4). However, shipments from P16 and P17 (expected in P20 and P21) have not arrived, though the OR engine placed 0 orders in P16 and P17. No arrival messages were generated for P20/P21 because no orders were placed in P16/P17. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 449 units in-transit (ordered in P18, P19, P20, P21). I will stick to L=4 as it remains the consistent observed lead time for all successful deliveries.

The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with orders typically arriving 4 periods after being placed (e.g., P18 arrived in P22). However, there is a recurring issue with lost or delayed shipments: the order from Period 5 was lost, and similarly, no arrivals occurred in Periods 20 and 21 (corresponding to orders from Periods 16 and 17, which were zero, explaining the gap). For Period 23, we are relying on a pipeline of 355 units. With an on-hand stock of 36 and an average demand of ~88, the total inventory (oh + in-transit) significantly exceeds the projected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), which would be roughly 440 units. Since the current pipeline is healthy but we want to maintain a service level for a lower demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (Periods 12-22) to reflect the new stabilized demand of ~88. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the demand regime continues to stabilize following the decline observed around Period 12. Calculating the average demand from Period 12 to 23 (12 data points) yields approximately 92.1 units per period. I will use recent_N=12 for the mu_hat calculation to capture this specific post-shift regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 seeing P18 arrival, P23 seeing P19 arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units with 315 in-transit (P20, P21, P22, P23 orders). Since on-hand + in-transit (367 units) is significantly lower than the expected pipeline requirement for (L+1)=5 periods (approx 92 * 5 = 460 units), setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods will prompt the OR backend to increase base stock levels while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 95 units per period after a shift observed around Period 12 (demand for Periods 18-24: 107, 83, 100, 73, 88, 110, 109; mean \u2248 95.7, std \u2248 14.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 22, 23, and 24. While a shipment from Period 5 was lost previously, recent shipments (ordered P18, P19, P20) arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4. Current inventory status reflects 38 units on-hand and 339 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level while managing a relatively modest holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility parameters to capture the post-regime-shift behavior (N=7 to reflect Periods 18-24) and 'default' for lead time (4 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 18: mean is approximately 96 units/period (observed P18-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized around a mean of 96 units/period since Period 18. Specifically, demand from Period 18-25 was 107, 83, 100, 73, 88, 110, 109, 85, averaging 94.4. The lead time appears stable at the promised 4 periods, with orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21 all arriving with a lead time of 4. There are currently 355 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, P25), which aligns with the expected pipeline for a 4-period lead time. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect the consistent history. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the stable period from P18 onwards) to capture the current mean of ~95 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture recent volatility (standard deviation ~13.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly after earlier regime shifts. Analyzing the period from P18 to P26, the demand mean is 95.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 412 units in-transit. Based on the lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from P23 (86 units) to arrive in P27. The OR backend uses a base stock policy where base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting L to 4, mu_hat to (1+4)*95.2 = 476, and sigma_hat to sqrt(5)*16 \u2248 35.8, the system will target a pipeline inventory level that covers 5 periods of demand plus safety stock for volatility. This approach balances the stockout risk (given 0 inventory) against holding costs in a stable regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-27) has stabilized with an average of approximately 95.3 units/period (Demand: 107, 83, 100, 73, 88, 110, 109, 85, 102, 96). Current on-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit inventory is 416 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods since early in the game. To align the OR backend with the current demand level, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable regime. For lead time, I'm using the 'calculate' method as it has been consistently 4 periods (excluding the single lost shipment from Period 5). The parameters (1+L)*demand_mean will help target a stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (lead time + current period).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime following a shift around Period 18. Based on demand from Period 18 to Period 28, the average demand is 98.6 units with moderate variability. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 25-28 matching orders from Periods 21-24). Inventory is currently low (on-hand 27) but there is a significant pipeline in-transit (382 units). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (capturing the period from P18 to P28) allows the OR backend to target the current demand level of ~98.6 units/period across the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods). This strategy balances the need to replenish safety stock after recent stockouts without over-ordering given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 18 to 28: average demand is ~98.6 units/period (N=11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P29) has averaged approximately 98.6 units per period, showing a significant spike to 151 in the most recent period (P29). Despite this outlier, the general regime remains stable around the 98-100 mark. Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods for all successfully delivered orders. The in-transit inventory is 351 units, which covers nearly 3.5 periods of demand, but the current on-hand inventory is 0 after the P29 spike. To maintain the service level while accounting for the recent spike without overreacting, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=12, covering the stable period P18-P29) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the increased volatility from the recent demand peak. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant upward shift starting from Period 29. Demand in P29 was 151 and P30 was 122, following a stable regime of ~98.6. This suggests a potential structural change or seasonal peak (e.g., a holiday effect). The average demand over the last 12 periods (P19-P30) is approximately 101.5. To capture the recent spike while maintaining stability, I am using recent_N=12 for the demand mean (mu_hat). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 397 units in-transit (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). The OR backend uses a service level based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), aiming for an 80% cycle service level. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 12 samples balances the historical average with the most recent high-demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected between Periods 29-30 (avg 136.5) compared to the Period 18-28 average (~98.6).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a demand spike regime that began around Period 29. Demand over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) has averaged 136 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~98.6 units. This spike coincides with the most recent 'conclude' messages showing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) despite arrivals. We need to adjust parameters to reflect this higher volume to avoid further lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent completed cycles (P24 arriving P28, P25 arriving P29, P26 arriving P30, P27 arriving P31). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spike (136 * 5 = 680), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained for 3 periods (P29-P31) with average demand of 136 units/period, roughly 38% higher than the previous Period 18-28 baseline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A demand spike was detected starting at Period 29. The average demand for Periods 29-32 is approximately 128.25 units, which is significantly higher than the previous Period 18-28 baseline of ~98.6 units. Despite ordering more in recent periods, on-hand inventory has remained zero for the last 4 periods due to this sustained demand increase. The current in-transit inventory is 518 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the new higher rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher mean (approx 128) and the associated volatility of this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents stockouts during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained for 4 periods (P29-P32) with an average of ~128 units/period, compared to the P18-28 average of ~99.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a sustained demand spike that began at Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 33 is 126.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~99 units observed between Periods 18-28. Although the demand in Period 33 (119) was lower than the peak in Period 29 (151), it remains approximately 20% above the former long-term average. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 32 and 33). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 589 units in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~80%). I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent higher-demand regime (Periods 29-33) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the spike. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current 126.4 average rather than the historical 100-110 average.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained for 5 periods (P29-P33) with average demand of 126.4 units/period, roughly 28% higher than the P18-28 baseline (~99).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a significant spike between Periods 29-33 (average ~126 units) compared to the Period 18-28 baseline (~99 units). However, Period 34 saw a drop to 85 units, suggesting the spike might be leveling off or returning to a slightly higher mean than the previous baseline. To balance the risk of stockouts during this volatile phase with the cost of holding inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P29-P34) to capture the elevated average (approx 119.5 units/period) while acknowledging the most recent decrease. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility observed during the spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent consistent arrivals (P22-P34 excluding P21's lost shipment logic). Current on-hand is 48, and in-transit is 532, which is substantial, so the OR backend will moderate the order size accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike from P29-P33 (avg ~126) moderated in P34 (demand 85), suggesting a potential new mean around 115-120 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct shift pattern. After a period of high demand (P29-P33, avg ~126), the last two periods (P34-P35) have cooled significantly to an average of 86 units. This suggests the earlier spike might have been a temporary seasonal or promotional event that has now concluded. The current on-hand inventory is 97, and the pipeline is substantial at 457 units. Given the inventory level and the recent moderation in demand, the objective is to prevent overstocking while maintaining a service level for a mean demand that likely sits between the low of 86 and the previous baseline of 99. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the tail end of the spike and the recent drop, smoothing the transition. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike (P29-P33, avg 126) has ended; demand in P34-P35 moderated to avg 86, suggesting a return toward the P18-P28 baseline (~99).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike (Periods 29-33, mean ~126) has clearly subsided. Demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) dropped to 85, 87, and 52 respectively, averaging 74.7. This is lower than the previous baseline of ~99 (P18-P28). I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory has risen to 205 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: average decreased significantly from 126.4 (P29-P33) to 74.7 (P34-P36).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-160.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a spike between Periods 29-33 (average ~126), demand has dropped sharply over the last four periods (P34-P37), averaging 66.25 units/period (85, 87, 52, 41). This represents a substantial decrease compared to the previous baseline and the spike. With 324 units on-hand and 204 units in-transit (ordered in P34, P35, P36), the current pipeline is very high relative to this new lower demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs and inventory bloat, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent 4-period regime. I'm using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend immediately, while keeping lead time at the stable observed value of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 continued: 4-period average (P34-P37) is 66.25 units, significantly lower than the P29-P33 spike (126.4) and the P18-P28 baseline (99).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 34. Following a temporary spike (P29-P33, avg ~126), demand has plummeted to an average of 64.4 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38: 85, 87, 52, 41, 79). This represents a decrease of approximately 49% from the spike phase and 35% from the long-term baseline (P18-P28, avg ~99). Current on-hand inventory is very high (321 units) relative to this new demand level, and there are still 128 units in-transit (ordered in P35-P36). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. To prevent excessive holding costs given the inventory surplus, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (L=4 implies a review+lead period of 5 units). The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) is significantly higher than the calculated base stock and will correctly place zero orders until inventory is depleted to appropriate levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: 5-period average (P34-P38) is 68.8 units, significantly lower than the P29-P33 spike (126.4) and the P18-P28 baseline (99).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 34. Following a spike (P29-P33, avg 126.4), the current regime (P34-P39) shows a much lower average demand of 74.7 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104). The most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) averaged 74.7, while the 6-period average since the drop is 74.7. Currently, the on-hand inventory is very high at 278 units due to large orders placed during the previous spike arriving now. With an in-transit quantity of 67 (ordered P36), the total pipeline + on-hand is 345 units. Given the new lower demand level, this stock is sufficient to cover demand for approximately 4.5 periods at the current mean. To avoid excessive holding costs while the inventory levels normalize to the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, from P34-P39) to reflect the recent downturn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: 6-period average (P34-P39) is 74.7 units, a significant decrease from the P29-P33 spike (126.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted multiple times. After a spike between Periods 29-33 (avg ~126), demand decreased significantly starting at Period 34. For the most recent 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is 76.1 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104, 111). The last few periods (P38-P40) show a slight upward trend (79, 104, 111), suggesting the mean might be stabilizing around 80-90 rather than the lower 60s seen initially after the spike ended. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is high (234) due to large orders placed during the demand spike arriving after demand dropped. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the recent mean of 76.1 units. With L=4, base stock targets 5 periods of demand (~380 units). Given current on-hand (234) and in-transit (73), the system is currently overstocked, but alignment with the current mean is necessary to prevent future stockouts as inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 stabilized: 7-period average (P34-P40) is 76.1 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized after the significant drop observed starting at Period 34. The 8-period average demand from Period 34 to 41 is approximately 80.1 units per period (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104, 111, 108). While recent demand (P39-P41) has ticked upward, the overall average remains lower than previous baselines. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the most reliable estimate based on recent history. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=8 to capture this current regime while acknowledging the recent slight increase in volatility and mean. Given the current high ending on-hand inventory (126) and substantial in-transit stock (195), the OR backend's capped policy should naturally moderate ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the $4.0 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: 8-period average (P34-P41) is 80.1 units/period, showing a recovery toward the P18-P28 baseline (~99) from the initial P34 drop but still significantly lower than the P29-P33 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has transitioned from a period of low demand (P34-P41 avg ~80) toward a stronger level, with the last three periods (P40-P42) averaging 109.7 units. This is very close to the historical baseline of ~115 and the stable P18-P28 period of ~99. Given the Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). The inventory position is currently 337 (16 on-hand + 321 in-transit). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. If we assume the recent mean of ~110 holds, expected demand over the lead time is 550. Our current pipeline (337) is significantly below this, though arrivals in Period 43 (ordered P39: 0) and Period 44 (ordered P40: 73) will be low. To prevent stockouts four periods from now, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the recovery phase (P34-P42) for both mu and sigma, allowing the OR backend to adjust our ordering upwards to reflect the returning demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: 3-period average (P40-P42) is 109.7 units/period, returning to near long-term baseline after the P34-P39 slump.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P43) has stabilized at a higher level than the P34-P39 slump, with a 4-period average of 105.25. This indicates a return to the longer-term baseline of approximately 100 units/period seen earlier in the game. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 450 units, but this includes potentially lost or delayed shipments from P41, P42, and P43 which have not yet concluded. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, order arrivals from Period 40 (73 units) and Period 41 (122 units) are expected in Period 44 and 45 respectively. To prevent stockouts during this recovery phase, I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend of the last 4 periods (avg 105) and setting sigma_hat with a longer window (N=10) to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully recovered from the P34-P39 slump; the 4-period average (P40-P43) is 105.25 units, aligning with pre-spike baseline levels.

The 5-period average is 105.0 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight that demand has fully recovered to pre-spike baseline levels (~99-105). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P40 order arriving in P44. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline (ordered P41-P44) is 499 units. Since the backend OR uses an (L+1) demand coverage model, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized recovery. I will also use the recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility accurately. This approach ensures the base stock is calculated using the most relevant and stable demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability reached: 5-period average (P40-P44) is 105.0 units/period, confirming a full return to baseline levels after the P34-P39 slump.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level after recovering from the slump between Periods 34-39. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 110.3 units, confirming the return to the pre-spike baseline. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory, and the pipeline inventory is 418 units. Order arrivals from Periods 37, 38, and 39 appear to be lost or severely delayed (matching the pattern observed in Period 12), as we are now in Period 46 and they should have arrived by Periods 41, 42, and 43 respectively. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and considers all in-transit units, I must account for these lost shipments to ensure the order calculation is not suppressed by 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to a recent average (4 periods), use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean (~110), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This will prompt the system to reorder sufficiently to cover demand through the lead time, given the empty on-hand state and the likely loss of previous transition orders.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are confirmed lost/delayed (did not arrive by P45). Demand stabilized at ~110 units/period (P40-P45 average 110.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P46) shows a sustained recovery and stabilization at a higher level than the P34-P39 slump. The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 114.7 units/period, with the most recent two periods (P45-P46) showing spikes of 137 and 145. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are definitively lost as they are well past the 4-period window and have not been recorded in 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for recent volatility (sigma_hat, recent_N=7). Period 50 is the game end, so L will remain at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P40-P46): average demand is ~114.7 units/period, showing a return to and slight exceeding of pre-slump baseline (~99-105).

Daily Profit: $516.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level than the previous baseline. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P40-P47) is approximately 119.75 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods (P45-P47) showing a further increase to 144.3 units/period possibly indicating a new peak or upward trend. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture this recovery and shift, resulting in a base stock calculated off an average of ~120 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and shipments from P37, P38, and P39 (which would have arrived by P43) are confirmed lost. The pipeline reflects orders from P44-P47. I will maintain L=4 as the observed lead time remains consistent for arriving shipments. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=8 will account for the increased volatility seen in recent periods (std \u2248 21.6), ensuring a sufficient service level for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P40-P47): Average demand increased to ~120 units/period, significantly higher than the P34-P39 slump (~75) and exceeding the P18-P28 baseline (~99).

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 9 periods (P40-P48), recovering from a mid-game slump. The average demand from P43-P48 is 148.2 units, and the most recent demand (P48) reached 165 units. This suggests a new higher-demand regime or seasonal peak. Shipments from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are confirmed lost, which explains why the 'In-transit' balance remained high while 'On-hand' was depleted. Because promised lead time (4) is stable for successful deliveries, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent high-demand window (P43-P48, average ~148), which protects against stockouts during this surge. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P43-P48): Average demand increased significantly to ~148 units/period, a ~50% increase over the P18-P28 baseline (~99).

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a significant upward shift, with the last 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 147.8 units, compared to the previously stabilized baseline of ~110-120. This suggests a new higher-demand regime. The stockout situation is severe (on-hand: 0) due to several orders from P37-P39 being confirmed lost and demand outstripping supply. Current in-transit inventory is high (618 units), with orders from P46-P49 (totaling 618) expected to arrive starting next period (P50). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is approximately 80%. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent surge and sigma_hat likewise to reflect the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 45: 5-period average is 147.8 units/period, a ~50% increase over the P18-28 baseline (~99) and significantly higher than the P40-P44 recovery period (~105).
