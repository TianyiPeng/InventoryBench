Given that demand seems to be slightly cooling from the 100/period peak to roughly 85/period (average of P15-P21), 592 units might lead to excess holding costs (covering ~7 periods).

The most recent three periods (P25-P27) saw demands of 80, 114, and 108 (average 100.6). The current inventory position is: On-hand = 76, In-transit = 351 (orders from P24: 0, P25: 70, P26: 140, P27: 141). Our goal is to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total required inventory for 5 periods @ ~100/period = 500 units. Current total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) = 427 units. This leaves a gap of 73 units. The OR recommendation is 140, which appears to be targeting a higher service level or reacting to the recent peaks. However, looking at the pipeline, we have large orders (140, 141) arriving in Periods 30 and 31. An order of 140 now would bring the pipeline and inventory total to 567. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $19.0, maintaining a healthy buffer is wise, but being slightly more conservative than the OR cap reduces the risk of overstocking if demand stays around 100.

Current status: On-hand = 10 units. Pipeline (In-transit) consists of orders from P42 (100), P43 (100), P44 (112), and P45 (139), totaling 451 units. Expected arrivals: P46 (100 from P42), P47 (100 from P43), P48 (112 from P44), P49 (139 from P45), and the current order in P50. Demand analysis: Recent 5-period average (P41-P45) is 122 units, showing a slight uptick from the previous stabilization level of ~102. Total demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) at an estimated 125 units/period is 625 units. Total available supply (On-hand + existing Pipeline) is 10 + 451 = 461 units. To meet the 625 units of estimated demand and minimize stockouts in the final periods, we need approximately 164 additional units. The OR recommendation is 128, but it uses long-term history and doesn't fully account for the recent demand increase to ~122-133.

The game ends at Period 50. Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed in Period 47 will arrive during Period 51 (after the game ends). \n4. **Final Strategy**: Because orders placed today arrive after the game conclusion (P47 + 4 = P51), placing an order has no utility but would incur ordering complexity if we were balancing long-term stock. However, since the goal is to maximize reward within the 50 periods, and this order won't arrive in time to satisfy demand or affect ending inventory within the window, the quantity is technically flexible. Historically, the OR recommendation is 100, but strategically, since it cannot arrive, 0 is the logical choice to avoid unnecessary pipeline calculation, though 100 also has no impact.

The existing pipeline (391 units) is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (average demand is ~115-120, total expected demand ~350-360).

Since the simulation concludes at the end of Period 50, any units ordered now will remain 'In-transit' and will never arrive to satisfy demand or contribute to profit. Furthermore, because these units will not arrive by the end of Period 50, they do not incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory at the conclusion of the final period. The current on-hand inventory is 108 units, and based on recent demand trends (averaging ~106 over the last 10 periods, with a recent dip to 75 and 68), this stock is likely sufficient to cover the final period's demand.
