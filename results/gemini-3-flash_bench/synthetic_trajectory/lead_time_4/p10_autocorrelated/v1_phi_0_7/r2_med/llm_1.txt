Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand of [81, 97, 100, 84, 70], averaging ~86.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I need to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods) to avoid stockouts. Based on the average demand of ~86 units, total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 430 units. Considering there might be some variability or growth, I will order 450 units to establish a pipeline that meets demand until the first shipment arrives in Period 5.",

Historical data (P1-P5 samples) shows an average demand of approximately 86.4 units, while the actual P1 demand was 103. Given the 4-period lead time, I need to cover demand for a window of L+1 (5 periods). Total units needed for P2 through P6 is roughly 5 * 90 = 450 units. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 450 in-transit. To maintain a safety stock and account for the high P1 demand, I will place a supplemental order. Although 450 is already coming, it won't arrive until P5. To ensure I don't run out immediately after that arrival and to build a buffer for the next cycle, I'll order another batch.

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48. We need to cover demand for Periods 44 through 48 (5 periods total) using our Current Inventory (135) and In-transit arrivals. The pipeline includes orders from P40 (120), P41 (110), P42 (80), and P43 (80), totaling 390 units. Total available stock for the target window is 135 (on-hand) + 390 (in-transit) = 525 units. At an estimated demand of 110 units/period, we need approximately 550 units to cover until Period 48. This leaves a small gap of 25 units. Ordering 100 units provides safety stock for the arrival in Period 48 and ensures we are positioned for the final two periods (49 and 50) without carrying excessive inventory relative to the end-of-game holding costs.",

My objective is to manage the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) to cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. As we are at Period 46 of 50, I must also avoid over-ordering, as excess inventory at Period 50 incurs holding costs without potential for future profit. Inventory Checklist: On-hand is 115. In-transit consists of orders from P42 (80), P43 (80), P44 (100), and P45 (60), totaling 320. Total inventory position is 435 units. Expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is approximately 575 units (115 units/period * 5). Current inventory position (435) leaves a projected deficit of 140 units. However, an order placed now at P46 will arrive at P50 (P46+4). It will only be available to satisfy demand for one period (Period 50) before the game ends. Orders placed after P46 (P47-P50) will arrive after the game concludes and should be avoided.

With the game ending at Period 50, the order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the payoff window. However, inventory management must account for the units already in the pipeline arriving in Periods 47-50. Pipeline status (L=4): Period 47 arrival (P43 order: 80), Period 48 arrival (P44 order: 100), Period 49 arrival (P45 order: 60), Period 50 arrival (P46 order: 120). Calculating projected stock: Current OH: 75; P47: (75 + 80) - 120 = 35; P48: (35 + 100) - 120 = 15; P49: (15 + 60) - 120 = -45 (Stockout). To maximize total reward, I need to prevent stockouts in remaining periods without over-ordering for post-game inventory. Since orders placed now arrive after the game ends, I will not place any new orders to avoid holding costs on inventory that won't contribute to profit. However, it's noted that Period 49 and 50 may face stockouts based on the current pipeline, but those stockouts are unavoidable now as the lead time is 4 periods and we are at Period 47.",

This indicates a slightly higher stabilization regime compared to the previous ~105-115 range. (c) Lead time: Confirmed stable at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 49. In-transit consists of orders from P44 (100), P45 (60), and P46 (120), totaling 280. Total pipeline (OH + IT) = 329. (e) Final order logic: We are at Period 48. Lead time is 4. An order placed now arrives in P52. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed in P47, P48, P49, and P50 will never arrive in time to satisfy demand. The arrivals we have left are: P48 (ordered P44: 100), P49 (ordered P45: 60), and P50 (ordered P46: 120). Total stock available to cover periods 48, 49, and 50 is 49 (OH) + 100 + 60 + 120 = 329. Expected demand for P48-P50 (3 periods) at ~119/period is ~357. We are slightly short (~28 units), but since any order placed now (P48) arrives in P52, it is impossible to satisfy this shortfall.

The effective lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed in Period N arrives during the arrival resolution of Period N+4. Therefore, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive during Period 53's resolution phase, which is beyond the game's horizon (Period 50). Current inventory on-hand is 74 units, and based on 'In-transit' data and history, we expect the following arrivals: Period 49 resolution (order from P45: 60 units), Period 50 resolution (order from P46: 120 units). Total units available to cover demand for the final two periods (49 and 50) is 74 (on-hand) + 60 (arriving P49) + 120 (arriving P50) = 254 units.
