Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), showing a mean of approximately 100.4. Since the lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, an initial order is critical. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the baseline for the backend OR engine.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 138 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As per the sequence, this order should arrive during Period 5 (visibility in Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 138 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 89, which resulted in 89 lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The historical demand data (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an average of 100.4 units per period. I am using the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available historical data points) to provide a stable forecast. Since inventory and in-transit units are currently low relative to the (L+1) window, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand until the first replenishment arrives.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) and Period 2 (135 units) are currently in-transit (total 273 units), with the first batch expected to arrive in Period 5. Demand for the first two periods was 89 and 107. Since lead time is 4, we must provide coverage for 5 periods (L+1). Given only 5 historical samples provided in the prompt (averaging ~100 units/period) and two actual demand observations (89, 107), a mean of ~100 seems appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (defaulting to the provided historical samples) to stabilize the forecast while we wait for the first arrivals. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand until the next possible arrival.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence). Current on-hand is 0, meaning demand in Periods 1-3 resulted in zero sales and lost profit. Historical demand samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) show an upward trend with a mean of ~100. Over the last 3 concluded periods (P1-P3), demand was 89, 107, 129. This trend suggests demand is increasing from the initial samples. I will set L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the rising demand trend observed in the concluded history. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility from the available samples. Our goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory (currently 408) covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). At an average demand of ~108, we need ~540 units in the pipeline; we are currently slightly under-buffered given the 0 on-hand situation and rising demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, and we have 542 units in-transit (P1-P4 orders). Demand history shows samples of 89, 107, 129, 75, and we are given a pre-history of 74, 108, 88, 98, 134. Combining all available data (9 samples), the mean demand is approx 100.2 units/period. The standard deviation is approx 20.7. Since we haven't confirmed any lead time deviations yet, I will use the default lead time (L=4). To capture the slightly higher variance and recent mean, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard deviation to be more responsive to recent fluctuations while awaiting the first pipeline arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Our demand history for the first five periods is [89, 107, 129, 75, 93], with an average of 98.6. There is no clear trend or seasonality yet. We currently have 45 units on-hand and 404 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 2 to arrive in Period 6. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). My parameters will use all 5 samples to establish a stable baseline for mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Profit: $92.00, Daily Holding Cost: $88.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 5 periods of demand and 2 confirmed arrivals. The promised lead time is 4, and the observed lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 88, with 313 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Demand history shows [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] from pre-game data and [89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92] from game history. The average demand across all 11 samples is approximately 99 units per period. Since L=4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 99, 5 periods requires 495 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 88 + in-transit 313) is 401 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it aligns with the observations, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical average and variance, which appear stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-49.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Demand remains relatively stable with samples: 89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87 (Mean \u2248 96). Current inventory status is 136 on-hand and 272 in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). Following the lead time definition (L=4), the inventory must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Although holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the high demand variability (Std Dev \u2248 17) necessitates a moderate safety stock to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and variance to capture the post-initial-noise regime, while maintaining L=4 as confirmed by recent conclusions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-4). Demand history for the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 97.5 units per period (sample values: 89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87, 108). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as the demand fluctuates around 90-110 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 210 units, consisting of orders from Periods 6 (44 units), 7 (94 units), and 8 (72 units), all of which are expected to arrive in Periods 10, 11, and 12 respectively. Given the promised lead time (L=4) is being met exactly, I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time. For demand forecasting, the full history (N=8) provides a stable baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs which are equal to profit ($1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). No arrival occurred in P9 because no order was placed in P5 (ordered=0). The current on-hand inventory is 104 units, with 326 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand across the 9 concluded periods has a mean of 93.2 and a standard deviation of 19.8. There is no clear shift in demand regime (range 58-129). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it matches the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full recent history since the start, providing a stable estimate for the base stock calculation. High holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($1) result in a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target a service level near the median to balance costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 38. In-transit inventory is 318, consisting of orders from P7 (94), P8 (72), P9 (116), and P10 (36). Based on history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). The demand for the last 10 periods (P1-10) is [89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87, 108, 58, 110], with a mean of 94.8 and a standard deviation of 19.3. I will continue using the promised/actual lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stable mean. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect current volatility. Note that in Period 9, the order placed in Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in 0 arrivals as expected, which did not break the lead-time pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the 'Period 11 conclude' message, we see an order placed in Period 7 arrived in Period 11, confirming lead_time = 4. Period 11 ended with 0 inventory, even though we sold 132 units out of a demand of 138 (lost sales = 6), indicating we are under-stocked. The demand over the last 11 periods (89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87, 108, 58, 110, 138) averages approximately 98.8 units. The promised lead time L=4 is consistent with observations. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P8 (72), P9 (116), P10 (36), and P11 (118), totaling 342 units. To prevent further stockouts given the volatility (std dev approx 21.6), I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent demand distribution while accounting for the recent spike to 138.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out (on-hand 0) despite 72 units arriving, as demand (95) exceeded supply. This confirms a service level issue. Looking at lead times: Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P8 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time. The order from P5 was 0, so no arrival was expected for it. However, P9 (ordered 116) should arrive in P13, P10 (ordered 36) in P14, P11 (ordered 118) in P15, and P12 (ordered 137) in P16. Current In-transit (407) matches these four pending orders (116+36+118+137). Demand is fairly stable but shows variance; the mean of the training samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) is 100.4. Game history mean (P1-P12) is approx 99.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full game history demand pattern. Lead time 'L' is stable at 4. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~500 units). Since current in-transit is 407 and on-hand is 0, the OR backend will likely order ~93 units to reach the target.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following three consecutive periods (P11-P13) of stockouts where demand exceeded arrivals. Demand has shown a slight upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 104.6 units compared to the overall average of 100.3. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated across multiple arrivals from P5 to P13). In-transit inventory stands at 377 units, consisting of orders from P10 (36), P11 (118), P12 (137), and P13 (86). The order from P10 is expected to arrive this period (P14), which is only 36 units and unlikely to meet the forecasted demand (~105), necessitating a protective order. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand intensity, and sigma_hat to default to ensure adequate safety stock during this recovery phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to 4 consecutive periods of stockouts where demand significantly outpaced arrivals (P11-P14). Historical demand mean for 'chips(Regular)' has trended upwards (~100 units/period overall, but ~118 units over the last 5 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in P5-P8 and P10-P14. The in-transit pipeline (481 units) includes orders from P11 (118), P12 (137), P13 (86), and P14 (140). The P11 order (118 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P15, which should temporarily alleviate the stockout. To recover service levels and account for the recent demand elevation, I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for demand forecasting to capture the current mean of ~102 units, while keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 provides a balanced look at the current regime while recovering from the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the historical data (P1-P4 and P6-P11 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments currently; the orders from Period 12, 13, 14, and 15 are still within the lead time window. Demand has been fluctuating but relatively stable. Given the stockouts between Periods 11-14, it is crucial to maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent demand trends (Periods 6-15) which represent the current regime. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 4, which aligns with observed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 16 has averaged approximately 105.1 units per period, which is higher than the initial seed data. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 11, we have faced stockouts due to high demand and slightly delayed inventory arrivals (e.g., Period 11, 12, 13, and 14 all ended with 0 inventory). Currently, we have 67 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Based on a lead time of 4 periods, we need to satisfy demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the current demand regime (~105/period * 5 = 525). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to account for higher volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 58 to 138). This approach ensures we target a base stock level that covers the lead time demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level internally by the OR engine).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 6 onwards: average demand increased to ~105 units/period (compared to ~100 initially) with higher variance (range 58-138).

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1-13 regularly arriving 4 periods later. The demand regime shift noted in Period 17 (mean ~105, higher variance) continues to be the best representation of the current state. The order placed in Period 14 (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 18 resolve phase. With current on-hand inventory at 59 and 358 units in-transit, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 12 periods (P6-P17) captures the current regime's higher demand and volatility while excluding the initial lower-demand seed data. This sample size (N=12) balances responsiveness with statistical stability. Given profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level targets the 50th percentile (the mean), and the OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent excessive over-ordering if volatility increases further.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-18) shows an average demand of approximately 101 units per period, but with significant variability (range: 58 to 138). Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 140 and in-transit is 305, totaling 445 units. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). A base stock target aiming to satisfy a critical ratio where profit = holding cost (q = 0.5) would typically suggest a target around 5 * 101 = 505 units. With 445 pipeline units, the system needs to maintain a flow of orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the detected regime from Period 6 onwards) and 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the consistently observed lead time of 4. This setup allows the backend to handle the current volatility while acknowledging the stable lead time behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20. The current state shows 51 units on hand and 319 units in transit. Looking at the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19). Demand has stabilized since the shift at Period 6. Calculating the mean demand from Period 6 through Period 19 gives approximately 101.4 units per period (1420 units total / 14 periods). The variance is somewhat high, with demand ranging from 58 to 138. The backend OR logic uses q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5. At q=0.5, the base stock targets the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). With L=4, the interval is 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the current demand regime starting from Period 6. This allows the system to calculate the mean and standard deviation from the most relevant recent history to set the base stock level efficiently.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 6 to a higher mean (approx. 104 units) with increased volatility. In the recent 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 109.6 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 351 units (orders from P17-P20), and on-hand is 23. The OR backend will use the 'recent_N' method to focus on the current demand regime. A value of N=15 is chosen to capture the full extent of the behavior since the regime shift at Period 6.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all reported arrivals (P1 through P17), so I will use the default lead time. Regarding demand, since Period 6, there has been a sustained regime with an average demand of approximately 104 units (calculated from P6-P21) and a standard deviation of about 23 units. The current on-hand inventory is 38 units with 383 units in transit (ordered in P18, P19, P20, and P21). To ensure sufficient stock covering the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), the backend needs to target a base stock level around ~520 units. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the current demand regime starting from Period 6, which provides a stable baseline while ignoring the initial startup phase.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 6) shows an average demand of approximately 102 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21. Lead times have been stable at exactly 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base-stock level should target the median of the demand distribution over the (L+1) horizon. Current on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 371 units (Total Pipeline = 410). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the identified regime shift) and for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment for chips(Regular) shows a stable actual lead time (L=4) and a recent demand regime established since Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (88) exceeded available stock (82). In-transit inventory stands at 411 units, which roughly covers the expected demand for the lead time pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). However, frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P11-P14, P23) suggest that the current target stock level needs adjustment to account for demand volatility. I am choosing L='calculate' to maintain the observed 4-period lead time. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, starting from the demand regime shift at Period 6 through Period 23, to capture the more volatile and slightly higher demand average (~98 units/period in the full history, but slightly higher recently) and ensure a robust safety stock in the OR backend calculation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable within the previously identified regime of ~105 units/period. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 10), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units with a standard deviation of about 20 units. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 21, 22, 23, and 24 which arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). No shipments appear lost; the in-transit inventory of 366 units accounts for orders from Period 21, 22, 23, and 24 (128+75+83+80 = 366). Current on-hand inventory is low (23), and the order from Period 21 (128 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 25). To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (given profit=holding cost=1.0, implying a 50% target service level for the base stock calculation, though the OR engine's cap provides safety), I will use the recent 15-period demand data (N=15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and continue using the promised/calculated lead time of 4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable within the previously identified regime of ~105 units/period starting around Period 6. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 99.8 units, while the full history since Period 6 averages 100.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on several confirmed arrivals (P21 order arrived at P25). Current inventory state: On-hand (30) + Pipeline (355) = 385. With a lead time L=4, we must cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. At ~100/period, target inventory is 500+. The system is currently slightly understocked relative to this target. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime since P6) and recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 17 onwards) shows an average demand of approximately 97 units per period with a standard deviation of about 15. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock level at the median of the demand distribution over the (L+1) risk window. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units) while in-transit is high (391 units). Historical arrivals confirm that orders from Periods 23, 24, 25, and 26 are currently in the pipeline. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters to reflect the current regime's mean and volatility, and maintain the stable lead time estimate of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a total in-transit of 378 units. We are in a regime with an average demand of approximately 100-105 units. Examining the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 97.3 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P24-P27 for orders placed in P20-P23). Since demand often exhausts on-hand inventory (e.g., P27 had 0 ending inventory), I will use a slightly larger N for mu_hat to stabilize the forecast around the current 100-unit mean while allowing for the observed variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time and using recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters provides a robust estimate for the current (L+1) horizon.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 406 units in-transit. Based on the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has stabilized into a regime with an average of approximately 100 units per period (the last 10 periods average is 98.3). The 'current status' shows an in-transit balance of 406, which accounts for orders placed in periods 25 (117), 26 (111), 27 (70), and 28 (108). The order from Period 25 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 29. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the very early initialization phase. Lead time remains 'default' (4), which aligns with the observed 4-period duration. This setup allows the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) at a 50% service level (as profit equals holding cost), preventing stockouts while minimizing excess inventory costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 49 units, with 378 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has stabilized into a regime with an average of approximately 100-105 units and moderate variance. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current demand regime's statistics while filtering out the initial startup volatility. This approach ensures the inventory covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) while maintaining a high service level given the equal cost of underage and overage (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% critical fractile, though the OR backend's capped policy provides a buffer).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the regime established around Period 6, with an average of approximately 100-105 units and a standard deviation around 15-20. Recent periods (P26-P30) show an average demand of 94.6, suggesting no significant recent shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 37 and in-transit is 338. Given the promised and observed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the very early startup data.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of ~100 units since Period 6, though recent periods show slightly higher values (Period 30: 123, Period 31: 114). Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods throughout the history (e.g., P27 order arrived on P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 31 demand exceeded supply, meaning we are in a stockout situation. To stabilize, I am setting mu_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current demand regime reliably. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect the current volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) to recover from the stockout and maintain service levels despite equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (approx. last 15 periods) confirms a stable regime with a mean of ~102 units and a standard deviation of ~17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent conclusion (P28 order arrived in P32). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 387 units, and on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Given that the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 allows the OR backend to synchronize with the current demand regime (+30% increase detected at Period 17). This setting balances the risk of stockouts (which have occurred recently in Periods 27, 28, and 31) with high holding costs, aiming for a base stock level sufficient to bridge the arrival of the next 4 in-transit shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 17 onwards) shows a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 400 units in transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have been experiencing frequent stockouts (P31 and P33 concluded with 0 ending inventory), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=17 to capture the demand characteristics of this stable regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), totaling (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=17 to reflect the observed volatility within this same timeframe, ensuring the safety stock adequately protects against demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 100 units since the regime shift noted at Period 6. Recent demand (P28-P34) averages 96.7 units, and the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 417 units in transit (covering roughly 4 periods of future demand), the objective is to maintain a steady order flow to satisfy the lead time + current period (L+1) demand. I will use a recent_N of 20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and variance, which covers the behavior from Period 15 to the present. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the observed volatility (~12-15 units std dev) while targeting the ~100 unit mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100-105 units. Looking at the last 15 periods (P21-P35), the average demand is 99.7 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Current inventory status shows 29 units on-hand and 361 units in-transit. The in-transit units correspond to orders from P32 (101), P33 (102), P34 (88), and P35 (70), totaling 361, which matches the system's pipeline report. This confirms no lost shipments. To maintain the inventory position for a 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stable current regime, while using 'default' for sigma_hat as the variance remains consistent with the historical profile.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a identifiable regime since Period 6, with an average demand of approximately 100-105 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all concluded arrivals. My current state shows 49 units on-hand and 358 units in-transit. The in-transit units correspond to orders from Periods 33, 34, 35, and 36 (102, 88, 70, 98 units respectively). Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods, I will continue using L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to encompass the stable regime observed since Period 6, which provides a robust sample size for both mean and variance (sigma_hat) calculations. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 17) remains stable with an average around 100 units. Period 37 concluded with 56 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since 'profit' equals 'holding cost' ($1.0 each), the target cycle service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime while smoothing out recent volatility. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for approximately 500 units in total pipeline + on-hand inventory to meet the service level target.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 39. History shows a stable lead time of 4 periods consistently. Demand since Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of ~100-105 units. Recent demand samples (Periods 34-38) are 100, 97, 81, 95, 112, with a mean of 97. Given the target service level (q = 0.5 since profit = holding cost = $1), the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the current mean and variance more accurately than a long-term average, while smoothing out very recent noise. This N=10 covers more than two full lead-time cycles (L+1=5).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 40. Historical demand shows a stable regime since Period 6, with an average of approximately 98 units per period and a standard deviation around 16. Leading up to Period 39, we've observed consistent 4-period lead times (e.g., Period 35 order arrived in Period 39). The on-hand inventory is low (18 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 393 units across the lead time. Given the Profit of $1 and Holding Cost of $1, the OR backend logic targets a 50% service level (z=0), effectively aiming to cover median demand. To maintain stability and account for the recent variance, I will use a 20-period lookback (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'post-Period 6' regime accurately without being over-reactive to single-period fluctuations. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 41 with 9 periods remaining. Examining the history up to Period 40, the lead time has been consistently stable at 4 periods. The demand regime identified around Period 17 continues to hold, with demand averaging approximately 100 units per period. Specifically, the average demand over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) is 98.4 units, and the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 93.4 units, indicating no significant recent shifts. On-hand inventory is 21 units, and there are 373 units in-transit (orders from P37-40), which aligns with the pipeline required for a 4-period lead time. To ensure optimal coverage while accounting for demand volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stable regime since Period 20. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect the current variance levels. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the established historical average of 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42. Historical data confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods and a demand regime that has leveled out around 100-105 units per period since Period 6. Specifically, looking at the last 15 periods (approx. Since Period 27), demand has stabilized with a mean of ~99 units and a standard deviation of ~14 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (5 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (376 units) which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable regime since Period 6 with a mean demand of approximately 100 units and a standard deviation of about 17. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently low (on-hand: 16), but there is a significant amount in-transit (398 units) scheduled to arrive over the next four periods. Period 42 showed a demand of 75, which is within the historical range. Since the Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which aligns with setting mu_hat based on the mean demand over (L+1) periods. To adapt to the established regime while remaining responsive to recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20, covering a sufficient history of the current regime. Lead time is set to default as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 39-43) shows a mean of approximately 102.4 units, consistent with the regime shift identified at Period 17 (avg ~105). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by Period 43's arrival (ordered P39, arrived P43). Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the pipeline is substantial (346 units). The upcoming periods (44-50) require covering demand through both the lead time (4 periods) and the current period (total 5 periods). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1/unit), the optimal service level is 50%, roughly targeting the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current demand regime's mean and variance while smoothing out the spike seen in Period 43 (demand=136). The methods 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend uses data from this established regime to calculate the base stock and order amount.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 45 out of 50. Analysis of the history shows a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has stabilized around a mean of approximately 98 units per period, with recent fluctuations between 62 and 136 units. The inventory position currently has 19 units on-hand and 396 units in-transit. With 5 periods remaining in the simulation, we are entering the final phase. To maintain service levels while accounting for the confirmed lead time, I will set L to 'default' (promised 4 periods). For and mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime observed over the last 20 periods (Period 25 to 44), where the average demand is approximately 97.4 and standard deviation is approximately 18.5. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock across the relevant (L+1) horizon while adapting to current volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46 out of 50. Analysis of historical data from Period 6 to Period 45 shows a stable demand regime with an average of approximately 98.7 units per period and a standard deviation of about 18 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 41-45). With the game ending in 5 periods, the objective is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 1 unit, and there are 379 units in-transit (orders from P42-P45). The pipeline is already significant relative to the remaining periods and expected demand (~400 units total demand remaining vs 379 in transit + 1 on hand). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=30 to capture the long-term stable regime since Period 15, and 'default' for L (4 periods) as it is reliable. This should keep the base stock level aligned with the current average demand and volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 47, with just 4 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 50). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since an order placed now (Period 47) would only arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 51 (observed at the start of Period 52), it will not arrive within the game's horizon. Therefore, the pipeline inventory of 374 units (ordered in Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46) plus the current on-hand inventory of 61 units is the total stock available to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50). Total available stock is 435 units. Historical mean demand since Period 6 is approximately 96.5 units per period. Over the remaining 4 periods, expected total demand is ~386 units. Given that any new order will not arrive in time and the current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) already exceeds the expected remaining demand (435 > 386), I will set L to 0 and mu_hat to a very low value via 'explicit' to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders that would only incur holding costs or arrive after the game ends. Sigma_hat is also set low to minimize safety stock calculations for non-arriving orders.

Daily Profit: $119.00, Daily Holding Cost: $13.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The game is nearing its end. On-hand inventory is 13, and in-transit inventory is high (303 units), consisting of orders from P44 (128 units), P45 (72 units), and P46 (103 units). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P44 order is expected to arrive in Period 48 resolution, P45 in P49, and P46 in P50. Since the game concludes at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 48) with a 4-period lead time would not arrive until Period 52 (after the game ends). Thus, ordering now only incurs inventory costs if it were to arrive earlier, and provides no profit benefit within the horizon. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are triggered, while maintaining a baseline forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the current regime (~100 units/period). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand volatility while effectively letting the OR backend see that pipeline inventory (303) far exceeds remaining demand for the final 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent history). Demand since Period 6 has averaged ~105 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows some volatility with a slightly lower mean (approx 96), but given the game is ending at Period 50, my goal for Period 49 is to set a final order that ensures we meet demand in Period 49 and 50 while minimizing ending inventory for the final calculation. Currently, we have 59 on-hand and 314 in-transit. The orders arriving in Period 49 (placed P45: 72 units) and Period 50 (placed P46: 103 units) are already committed. In-transit breakdown based on history: P45 (72), P46 (103), P48 (139). Note: P47 order was 0. The order placed now at P49 will arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game end (Period 50). Therefore, the order placed this period will not affect the total reward as it won't arrive in time to be sold or incur holding costs before the game ends. However, for policy consistency, I will maintain the current regime parameters. I'll use recent_N=10 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations.

Daily Profit: $131.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (conclude messages) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 324 units in-transit. Demand since Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of ~100-105 units per period. The recent demand (last 10 periods) shows some volatility (ranging from 48 to 137). Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), any order placed now will arrive in Period 54 (due to L=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to function. I will maintain the lead time at 4 and use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=20 to capture the current stable but variable regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent historical average (~100/period) and variance.
