Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an average of 100.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no prior 'conclude' message yet to evaluate actual lead time performance, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) and include all 5 available historical samples to set the initial baseline. The backend base stock calculation will account for the critical ratio (19/(19+1) = 0.95), and the parameters help the system cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods while the first order is in transit.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 138 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected for L=4, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrivals occur during the period and are reported in the next period's 'conclude' message). Customer demand in Period 1 was 98 units, but since starting inventory was 0 and nothing arrived before demand resolution, all demand was lost (sold=0). The order placed in Period 1 is now in-transit (138 units). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an average of approximately 100 units per period. With L=4 (total exposure period = 5), the expected total demand is ~500. I will maintain the default lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or missing shipments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) and Period 2 (135 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts/lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data) shows a mean of approximately 100 units (74, 108, 88, 98, 134). More recent demand in Period 1 and 2 was 98 and 83. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most relevant recent trends while accounting for lead-time protection. Since no orders have arrived yet, I will use the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 3 periods was {98, 83, 136}. Including the provided pre-game samples {74, 108, 88, 98, 134}, the mean demand is approximately 102.3 and the standard deviation is approximately 21.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet, which is expected as the earliest arrival (ordered P1, L=4) would occur during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (seen at Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is 138+135+149 = 422 units. Since the actual lead time is not yet verifiable, I will stick with the promised L=4. For demand estimation, I will use all 8 available samples (5 historical + 3 game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet (values fluctuate but stay within a reasonable range for regular snacks).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and become visible in the Period 5 conclusion message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-4 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time deviation or lost shipments. Demand in the first 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) averages 100.4 units. There is a slight upward trend in the most recent period (134), but with only 5 data points, it is early to declare a regime shift. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics since the start of the game, which results in a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1382.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming the promised lead time L=4. Demand history (Periods 1-5) shows values of 98, 83, 136, 91, and 76. The mean demand is 96.8 with a standard deviation of 23.3. There is no evidence of a regime shift yet; the fluctuation is within normal bounds for a new product/SKU. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our total pipeline inventory is high (496 in-transit + 62 on-hand = 558), while 5 periods of average demand is ~484. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and order amount based on the parameters provided. I will use 'default' for L to match the confirmed 4-period lead time, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the most relevant recent behavior as we establish a baseline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2103.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand over the last 6 periods averages 100 units (98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115). Lead time is confirmed as a consistent 4 periods based on orders from Period 1 and 2 arriving in Periods 5 and 6 respectively. The current inventory position is: On-hand (82) + In-transit (374) = 456 units. With a lead time (L) of 4, our base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At an average of 100/period, target inventory is 500. Currently, we have 456 units in the pipeline, which is reasonable. No significant demand regime shift is detected yet (values range between 76-136). I will use L=4 (default) and recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variability accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $809.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52], averaging ~93 units per period. The standard deviation is approximately 26. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 8 decision, L=4. This means we are covering demand for 1+L = 5 periods. Using recent_N=7 for demand statistics captures the full historical range while acknowledging the latest lower demand (52 in P7). mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 93 = 465. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(5) * 26 \u2248 58. On-hand (179) plus In-transit (350) equals 529 units, which is already above the likely base stock level. However, the backend OR logic calculates the order capped by pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to provide the most stable estimate of demand behavior observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1641.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (validated by deliveries from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4). The current on-hand inventory is 221 units, with 246 units in transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Total pipeline inventory is 467. The recent demand history (last 8 periods) shows a mean of approximately 93.8 units per period (98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98). The standard deviation over these 8 periods is roughly 24.6. Since we are at Period 9 and have 8 actual demand observations from the game history, plus 5 initial samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture all available data points (8 game + 5 initial). This stabilizes the forecast against the higher volatility seen in earlier samples. The lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods, so the 'default' method is appropriate for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1647.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1-5 arrived in Periods 5-9 respectively). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 9 periods has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift; the mean demand is approximately 94 units per period (Samples: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98, 97). Current inventory is healthy: On-hand is 196, and In-transit is 275 (composed of orders from P6: 13, P7: 125, P8: 36, P9: 101). Total pipeline and on-hand (471) covers roughly 5 periods of average demand. Given the stability, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand (N=9) and sigma to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1431.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 127 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit. Based on the 'conclude' messages from Periods 5 through 10, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N+4). The backend OR parameters need to cover demand for lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand (including the seed data and Periods 1-10) shows a mean demand of approximately 96.5 units per period. I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior, which includes the historical seed data and the initial periods of the game. Using 'recent_N' for L with N=6 (the periods where arrivals have occurred) confirms the 4-period lead time. This strategy ensures the base stock (mu_hat) accounts for ~483 units over the 5-period risk horizon, balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1948.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-11). The rolling average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 94.8 units. Recent demand exhibits some volatility but no clear regime shift (ranging from 52 to 136). The pipeline inventory including the Period 11 order is 296 units (unconcluded orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, 11). Current on-hand inventory is 142. Since (L+1) demand is roughly 5 * 95 = 475 units, and our total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 438, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order. We use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the full stable history since start, and 'default' for sigma_hat and L to align with the confirmed stability of the system.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 28 units. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods based on history (Periods 1-8 arrivals confirmed L=4). Average demand over the first 12 periods is approximately 99 units per period (sum=1188/12). Recent demand in Period 12 spiked to 150, which is significantly higher than the average. To prevent stockouts during the 4-period lead time (plus the current period, total L+1=5), I need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 5 periods of demand. The existing in-transit (pipeline) is 374 units + 28 on-hand = 402 units. Given the mean demand of ~100, 402 units covers about 4 periods, which is tight. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent upward trend (means of last 5: 97, 82, 110, 150, plus the user-provided context samples). N=5 is chosen to balance the long-term mean with the recent volatility and high demand in P11-P12.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as observed in the arrivals for orders placed in periods 1 through 9. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and we have 423 units in transit. Historical demand shows relative stability with some fluctuations. Excluding the initial seed data (Periods 1-5 of user provided history), the demand average since Period 1 is approximately 97 units (Periods 1-13 mean = 97.46). To calculate mu_hat, we need to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there are no distinct regime shifts or seasonal markers identified (categorical 'chips' with generic dates), I will use the most recent 10 samples (Periods 4-13) to capture recent volatility and mean demand while staying responsive to any subtle shifts. This provides a stable baseline for the OR backend's service level calculation.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight upward trend, with the average demand over the last 14 periods being approximately 99 units, while the peak demand reached 150 units in Period 12. Lead time is stable at exactly 4 periods based on 10 consecutive observations (Orders from Periods 1-10 all arrived with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 434 units. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($19/$1 holding cost), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect recent demand volatility. I will use the last 10 periods for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current demand regime and default settings for lead time and sigma_hat as they are well-behaved.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1596.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory for 'chips(Regular)' reached 0 in Period 15, resulting in 19 units of unmet demand. The promised and actual lead times have been consistently 4 periods. Since Period 11, demand has fluctuated but shows a slight uptick (mean of last 5 periods: 113.4 vs. overall mean: 99.8). To recover from the stockout and maintain high service levels (critical given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods to capture the recent volatility and higher mean accurately. Using N=10 for mu_hat (103.1 avg) and sigma_hat (21.5 std) balances responsiveness with smoothing. Lead time L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Stockout occurred (19 units lost demand) due to cumulative demand exceeding arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1186.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility with a mean around 98 units per period based on the 16 observed demand samples. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all reported arrivals (Periods 5-16). There was a critical stockout in Period 15 because the starting on-hand inventory (84 units) was insufficient to meet a demand of 103 units, which can be attributed to a sequence of lower arrivals (86, 73) relative to recent higher demand. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, with 493 units in transit. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lead time (L=4) and ensuring the pipeline is replenished correctly, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture recent consumption patterns more accurately than a total history average. Specifically, N=10 is chosen to balance responsiveness to recent fluctuations (like the Period 12 spike to 150) against data stability.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed since Period 5 (L=4). Demand appears relatively stable but exhibits significant variance. Recent demand samples (P12-P17) are 150, 77, 127, 103, 65, 118, with an average of approximately 107. Although there was a stockout in Period 15, the system has recovered with an on-hand inventory of 81 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 389 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%). I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime which averages higher than the initial samples. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current variability while the pipeline replenishment logic accounts for the units already in transit.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 14 concluded deliveries (Periods 5-18). Demand remains relatively stable but with high variance, averaging 106.6 units since Period 10. The stockout in Period 15 was caused by back-to-back high demand in Periods 12 and 14 combined with lower-than-average arrivals from smaller orders placed in P8/P11. In-transit inventory is currently 451, representing orders from Periods 15 (138), 16 (108), 17 (46), and 18 (159). The Period 15 order (138 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 19. Using recent_N=9 for demand statistics (Periods 10-18) captures the current mean (approx 107) and variance efficiently, ensuring the (L+1)=5 period pipeline target covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer to prevent further stockouts. No regime shift or lead time drift is detected.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival confirmation from Period 5 through Period 19. Demand remains relatively stable with some fluctuations; the most recent 19 samples show an average of approximately 100 units per period. The stockout in Period 15 was caused by a period of lower-than-average arrivals from previous orders (specifically Period 11's order of 73 units followed by demand exceeding on-hand inventory). Currently, on-hand inventory is 118, and there are 457 units in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time as the consistency is high. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture the full observed history of demand after the initial period, ensuring the OR backend has a robust estimate of mean and variance to maintain the required service level while balancing holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 16 arrived orders (P1 through P16). Demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts, though it peaked slightly between Periods 12-14 and dipped around Period 19. The mean demand over the last 20 periods (including initial samples) is approximately 100.8. Current inventory (96 on-hand + 366 in-transit) is sufficient for about 4.5 periods of demand at current rates. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical demand variability while staying responsive to the overall mean. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the chips(Regular) SKU has an on-hand inventory of 21 and a significant pipeline of 459 units (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods as promised. Demand remains volatile but shows a slight upward trend in mean over the last 10 periods compared to the very early game (avg ~105 vs early 90s). The stockout at Period 15 was due to a series of lower orders following the Period 6 arrival burst. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am using a recent_N window for demand to capture recent volatility while relying on the stable lead time of 4. Since the pipeline is large (459 units), the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally temper the current order size to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring the (L+1) window is covered.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable with an average of around 100 units per period. Data shows a slight increase in volatility in the most recent 10 periods (standard deviation approx 26) compared to the overall history. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-14, 16-22). The objective is to maintain a high service level (approx 95% target given $19/$1 holding cost) while preventing stockouts like the one seen in Period 15. On-hand inventory is currently 98 units with 459 in-transit. I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent consumption patterns while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2238.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility but remains within a consistent range. Over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has been 65, 130, 121, 82, and 124, averaging 104.4 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for orders from P1 through P19. With a current on-hand inventory of 118 and 370 units in transit (expected arrivals in P24-P27), the pipelines are reasonably full. I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both lead time (L) and demand (mu_hat) to capture recent trends while smoothing out high-frequency noise. This helps maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which justifies holding a safety stock buffer to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 15.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 16 to 24 shows a mean of approximately 105.7 units per period, while the overall history suggests a mean of 98.6. There is no clear seasonal or date-based peak, but demand remains volatile. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 21, demand has fluctuated between 65 and 124 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level (mean ~104.3) and volatility, as the signal from Period 15's stockout indicated that a wider look-back might be insufficient to prevent stockouts during demand clusters. Currently, on-hand inventory is 70 and pipeline inventory is 497 (encompassing orders from Periods 21, 22, 23, and 24). The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent history helps adjust for any slight upward drift in demand compared to the initial periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized into a recognizable range with moderate fluctuations. Examining the last 10 periods (Periods 16-25), the average demand is 101.3 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods throughout the entire history (all observed arrivals from P1 to P21 arrived exactly in 4 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 116, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 399 units. This total inventory position (515) is relatively healthy considering the lead time of 4 and a demand rate around 100. Based on the profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 captures the most stable recent demand regime while filtering out the lighter volatility seen in the earliest periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current variability for the safety stock calculation. Lead time is kept at 'default' as it perfectly matches the promised value.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 26 periods, with a mean around 98 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. In Period 26, demand was 59 units, and an arrival of 159 units (from Period 22) brought the ending on-hand inventory to 216. Currently, we have 216 units on-hand and 329 in-transit (orders from Periods 23, 24, 25, and 26). The total pipeline inventory is 545 units. Given that we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 5 * 98 = 490 units), our current position is sufficient. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the representative demand behavior since the early initialization phase, ensuring we maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2189.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met based on historical data (orders from P1 up to P23 have all arrived with L=4). Therefore, L is set to 'default'. Demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized into a consistent regime after some early volatility. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 13), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods) has shown a slightly lower average (approx 91) but with high variance. Using a window of N=15 for mu_hat provides a robust estimate of 100 per period, leading to a total mu_hat of (1+4)*100 = 500. For sigma_hat, using recent_N=15 captures the current volatility better than the full history, ensuring the base stock level (around 620 units given profit/holding ratio) provides enough buffer to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 15, while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1848.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 28 periods is approximately 99 units. Recent demand has fluctuated between 59 and 123 units, with the most recent Period 28 at 107. Lead time has been consistently stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (185) plus in-transit (306) equals 491 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of average demand (approx 495), the system is well-stocked. To maintain this balance and account for the (L+1) = 5 period planning horizon, I will use a recent 10-period window to capture current volatility while Smoothing out temporary dips (like Period 26). The methods chosen ('recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat) will look at the last 10 samples to calculate mean and standard deviation, which are then scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively by the backend OR engine.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a slightly increasing trend in mean from the initial training periods (average ~100) to more recent periods, but remains volatile. Looking at the last 15 periods (approx. three lead-time cycles), the average demand is 97.4, which is consistent with the long-term mean. No significant regime shift is detected that would warrant a restricted N. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods since Period 5, matching the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently healthy (138 on-hand + 361 in-transit = 499 total coverage), which covers approximately 5 periods of average demand (approx. 500 units), aligning well with the (L+1) coverage requirement for a lead time of 4. I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available data points for the highest statistical stability, as no distinct seasonal or trend-based changepoints are yet confirmed beyond normal noise.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since the beginning, with an average demand of approximately 98.7 units per period across all 30 periods. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes visible in the data. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrival data (e.g., Period 26 order arriving in Period 30). With a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Current on-hand inventory is 101 units, with a significant pipeline of 361 units (orders from periods 27, 28, 29, and 30). I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean demand from all samples to drive the base-stock calculation, as the variance and mean are stable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-31) shows an average demand of approximately 100 units per period (1095 total over 11 periods), with historical volatility remaining significant. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals at L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is very low (22 units) coming off several high-demand periods (126 and 127 in P30 and P31). To prevent a stockout while waiting for the next large arrivals (which should be 128 units from P28 and 96 units from P29), I am using a recent_N window (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current demand regime. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated against recent mean demand (~500 units total), which aligns with the OR engine's objective to maintain service levels given high profit margins ($19) relative to holding costs ($1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been stable with a slight upward trend in recent variability. Current on-hand inventory is 29, and there are 450 units in transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Since Period 28, demand has stayed within the 88-127 range (avg ~114). The OR backend's base-stock calculation will account for the lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5) to ensure sufficient coverage. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the backend will target a high service level. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 captures the current demand regime's mean and volatility effectively for the upcoming cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 30-33) has averaged 131.5 units, significantly higher than the overall historical mean (~100). Period 33 resulted in a stockout (27 units of lost demand), with on-hand inventory hitting 0. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current lead time is 4 periods and demand has stepped up, I need to adjust the backend parameters to target a higher base stock. My calculation of (1+L) * mu_hat must cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=10 captures this recent upward trend in demand more effectively than the long-term average, while staying robust against single-period noise. mu_hat will be based on N=10 to reflect the 100-150 range observed recently. sigma_hat will also use N=10 to account for recent volatility. This should trigger an order that refill the pipeline to cover the higher demand and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 30: Average demand increased from ~100 to ~130. Stockout occurred in Period 33 (27 units lost) due to this shift and low starting on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1171.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a higher regime starting around Period 30. The average demand in the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34) is 117.8, compared to the earlier average of ~100. A stockout occurred in Period 33, indicating that previous inventory levels were insufficient for this new demand level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a clear regime shift, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and the increased volatility observed in recent periods (standard deviation of the last 5 periods is approximately 34.6, vs ~20 earlier). This ensures the OR engine targets a higher base stock (covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand) to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand spike.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 30. Comparing the demand from Period 1-29 (avg ~96) to Period 30-35 (avg ~124, with peaks over 150), there is a clear regime change. Recent periods (31, 32, 33, 35) show demand consistently exceeding the previous average, leading to stockouts in Periods 33 and 35. To address this, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this higher demand level (approx 124 units per period). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in the new regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of Period 31's order in Period 35 (exactly 4 periods). With 0 on-hand inventory and high current demand, the OR backend needs to set a higher base stock to recover service levels and prevent further lost sales.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~130. Recent demand (last 7 periods) averages approximately 123.5, but with significant volatility (highs of 150+ and lows around 60). We have experienced stockouts at Period 33 and 35, indicating that previous base stock levels were insufficient for this higher-demand regime. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since we are in Period 37, we must ensure the 'pipeline' (on-hand + in-transit) covers demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the shift) and sigma_hat to adjust to the new volatility. This will increase the order quantity to better buffer against the recent demand spikes and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high in-transit amount of 600 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with average demand increasing from ~100 to ~130. Recent demand (last 8 periods) shows an average of approximately 117 units per period with significant volatility, including periods of stockouts in P33 and P35. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations. To ensure adequate coverage during the L+1 window (5 periods) and account for the higher demand volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the period since the regime shift). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current higher demand mean and variance, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost while mitigating stockout risks observed in recent history.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 34 continues to be evident, with demand since Period 30 averaging approximately 126.6 units (samples: 126, 127, 121, 152, 63, 157, 57, 130, 133). While there is significant volatility (standard deviation), the mean is clearly higher than the earlier periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 35-38). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=9 to capture this higher demand regime starting from Period 30. Similarly, sigma_hat will use N=9 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2645.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shifted to a higher regime starting around Period 30. Analyzing demand from Period 30 to Period 39, the mean is approximately 121 units/period, compared to the earlier average of ~100. Recent periods (P37-P39) show even higher sustained demand (130, 133, 144). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 91 and in-transit at 487, the total pipeline is 578. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand phase (last seen in P33 and P35), I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This will set a base stock level that accounts for the L+1 (5 period) risk window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P30 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~121 (+21%) with recent peaks exceeding 140.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 30 is well-documented and sustained, with an average demand of approximately 121 units compared to the pre-P30 average of ~100. Recent periods (P37-P40) show consistent demand between 115 and 144, supporting this higher baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 156 units on-hand and 460 units in-transit (covering orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), the current pipeline is healthy. To align the OR backend with the current demand regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering Period 30 to Period 40). This allows the base stock calculation to reflect the higher mean (~121) and the observed volatility of this new regime, ensuring the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio is maintained while adapting to the recent structural shift.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) successfully shifted upward around Period 30, increasing from a mean of ~100 to ~121. Recent observations show volatility with frequent peaks exceeding 130 and 140. I am using a recent_N approach (N=11) to capture this higher demand regime starting from Period 31. This N provides a robust estimate of the new mean and variance for the OR optimizer while filtering out the pre-shift lower demand data. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 order arrival in P41). On-hand inventory is currently healthy (134), and the pipeline (524) is well-populated with orders placed during the high-demand regime. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput and volatility required to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 33 and 35.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with the mean increasing from approx 100 to 121. Recent fluctuations (P30-P42) show a mean of ~114 and a standard deviation of ~33. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture this higher demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13) to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (observed consistently throughout the history). The inventory position (On-hand: 162 + In-transit: 444 = 606) is being monitored to ensure it covers the (L+1)=5 period lead time window, which at a mean of ~114 units/period requires approx 570 units. Current pipeline is sufficient, but OR engine will refine the order based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1724.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 120 units per period compared to the earlier mean of 100. Recent demand (P41-P43) has been slightly lower (64, 103, 101), but the overall trend since P30 remains consistent. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P44-P50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1=5) based on the elevated demand regime. Currently, On-hand (195) + Pipeline (402) = 597 units. Based on a mean of 120, expected demand over 5 periods is 600. Using 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the period since the regime shift at P30) will allow the OR engine to capture this higher mean and variance accurately, ensuring the base stock level reflects the new normal and avoids stockouts observed in P33 and P35 while accounting for the high critical ratio (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 30, with the mean increasing from approximately 100 to 121 units per period. Recent data (P30-P44) shows an average demand of 113.3, but the Carry-over Insights suggest a higher shift (+21%) was observed. The period is nearing the game's end (P45 of 50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 260 units on-hand and 341 in-transit (Total pipeline = 601), we are well-covered for the remaining 5 periods given the current demand rate (~115-120). To capture the recent higher-mean regime and ensure sufficient stock for potential late-game peaks while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end, I will use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the post-shift performance. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 30 has stabilized at a higher mean. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P31-P45), the average demand is approximately 112 units per period, while the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45) show a slightly lower average of 107. However, peak demands still reach 144-157. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 241 units on-hand and 313 in-transit (P42-P45 orders), the pipeline is healthy. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the elevated demand level since the shift, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficiently high to prevent stockouts while balancing against the holding cost. Sigma_hat will also use N=15 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 of 50. The demand regime shifted upward around Period 30, averaging approximately 121 units per period compared to the earlier average of 100. Recent demand (P30-P46) remains consistent with this higher level, though with some volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., P42 order arrived in P46, a 4-period lead time). The current on-hand inventory is 205, and 'in-transit' is 386 units (total pipeline of 591). Using a 5-period window (P47 to P51) to cover the lead time (L=4), we look at the mean demand of the last 17 periods (N=17) since the regime shift. mu_hat will be set using recent_N with N=17 to capture this higher mean (~114-121 per period). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=17) to account for the increased volatility seen in the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of 50. The demand regime shifted around Period 30, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~121 units per period. In the most recent periods (P41-P47), demand has moderated slightly, averaging ~91, but the overall volatility remains present. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 228 units, with 374 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given we are nearly at the end of the game (P50), we need to ensure we don't over-order and incur unnecessary holding costs for the final two periods while still covering potential demand spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the period from the P30 shift to now) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the higher mean and variance of the current regime. This helps the OR backend maintain a safe service level for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1320.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, with only two periods left in the simulation. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods throughout the game. Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift around Period 30, where average demand increased to approximately 121 units per period. In the most recent block (P41-P48), demand has moderated slightly, averaging ~90 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 238 and in-transit inventory is 342, our total pipeline (580 units) far exceeds any possible demand for the remaining two periods, considering the 4-period lead time. Any order placed now at Period 49 will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, to maximize total reward and minimize unnecessary holding costs for the final transition, we set parameters that reflect the current demand regime (last 19 periods since the P30 shift) while acknowledging that no new orders are functionally required to meet the remaining demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 30, characterized by an increase in mean and variability (reaching peaks above 140). However, the last 10 periods (P40-P49) show a slight cooling or stabilization compared to that peak transition, with an average demand of approximately 91.6 units and a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as promised. With a critical ratio of 0.95 ($19/$20), the OR backend needs to maintain a relatively high service level. Given the recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current 'stabilized' post-shift regime, while maintaining the L=4 parameter. On-hand + In-transit (237+337=574) is healthy compared to the 5-period demand window (~460 units), suggesting the system is well-buffered.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-shift (P30+) has stabilized between P40-P49 at a mean of ~92 units, lower than the P30-P39 peak (~121) but higher than the pre-P30 baseline (~100).
