Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have a set of historical demand points (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). The most recent value (69) is significantly lower than the previous four, which may indicate a drop in demand or a data outlier. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To initialize, I will use all 5 historical samples to estimate demand and set L to default (0). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is high (~0.95), suggesting we should carry enough stock to avoid stockouts even with the recent drop.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 191 units was placed and arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The demand for Period 1 was 105 units, leaving 86 units on-hand. Based on the historical demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) and the first game period (105), the demand seems lower than the initial historical average (approx 131). However, Period 5's historical demand of 69 was an outlier. Currently, with an on-hand inventory of 86 units and a base stock calculation target of approximately 1.5 - 2 periods of demand (since lead time is 0), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the game period) to catch current demand levels while maintaining a safe stock level to cover potential spikes. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand in Period 1 was 105 and Period 2 was 118. The current on-hand inventory is 44 units. Looking at the provided historical demand samples (Period 1: 150, Period 2: 163, Period 3: 134, Period 4: 139, Period 5: 69), there is a discrepancy between the 'Game History' (P1: 105, P2: 118) and the 'Historical Demand Data' list (P1: 150, P2: 163). I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand (mean ~111.5) as it reflects the actual sales/inventory impacts seen. Using a lead time of 0 (L=0), the OR backend needs effectively a 1-period lookahead (1+L). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the most recent realized demand mean and variance to set the base stock level, ensuring we cover the upcoming demand while keeping holding costs low given the $1/unit cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1733.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that all orders (Period 1, 2, and 3) arrived within the same period they were placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand across the first three periods has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend (105, 118, 93), averaging 105.3 units. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is approximately 95% (19/(19+1) = 0.95), meaning we should aim to cover demand variability to avoid stockouts. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent mean and volatility, which better reflects the current demand regime than the full history as it adjusts for the specific characteristics of the product 'chips(Regular)' over the available data points. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1994.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with historical samples: 105, 118, 93, 106. In Period 5, there was a significant drop in demand to 69 units (noted in the prompt's historical demand data). While the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time observed in Periods 1-4 has consistently been 0. However, I must ensure current on-hand inventory (20) plus the new order covers the expected demand for the remainder of this period and the next, especially since demand dropped recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to smooth out the Period 5 drop while acknowledging the previous stable regime. The critical service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95, which means the OR engine will target a 95% service level. Setting L to 'calculate' effectively uses the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1757.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is 29 units with nothing in transit. Based on the historical arrival data from Periods 1-5, all orders placed have arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across Period 1 to Period 5 is 105, 118, 93, 106, and 94 respectively (Note: The user-provided samples for Period 5: 69 contradicts the 'conclude' message value of 94; I will prioritize the 'conclude' logs which show actual demand satisfied). The demand appears stable with a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of about 10. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat across all available samples (N=5) to capture the baseline demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2394.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first six periods, with an average demand of approximately 107.3 units per period. The observed actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The most recent demand in Period 6 (128 units) is slightly above the average but within a normal range of variation. To capture this recent stability while allowing for slight fluctuations, I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (the full available history). Since the lead time is consistently 0, the explicit value of 0 is used for L. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers immediate demand with a high service level, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1010.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period (P1-P7). Demand analysis for the last 7 periods shows an average of ~100 units per period. However, Period 7 showed a significant drop to 57 units (a ~40% decrease from the previous average). This drop might be a temporary outlier or a regime shift. Given the product (Regular Chips), demand is usually stable but can fluctuate based on promotions or seasonal dips. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=4) to give more weight to recent performance while not overreacting exclusively to the P7 dip. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 5 samples to capture the recent volatility increase observed between P6 (128) and P7 (57).

Daily Reward (R_t): $821.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-8 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods in every instance. Demand analysis shows a significant drop starting in Period 7. The mean demand for Periods 1-6 was approximately 107.3 units, whereas the mean for Periods 7-8 dropped to 52.5 units (a ~50% decrease). Given this clear regime shift, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent data points (Periods 6, 7, and 8) while still having enough samples to calculate variance. This choice helps the OR backend adjust the inventory level downward to avoid excessive holding costs in the face of lower observed demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~107 to ~53 units (-50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $610.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downward shift starting from Period 7. Before Period 7, demand averaged approximately 107 units. Over the last three periods (P7-P9), demand has dropped significantly to 57, 48, and 38 units respectively, averaging 47.7 units. This represents a reduction of over 50%. On-hand inventory is currently high (112 units) relative to this new demand level, being nearly 2.4 times the recent average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed across all history. To prevent further inventory buildup and minimize holding costs while the inventory depletes, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (P7, P8, P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1648.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 1-6, the average demand was approximately 107 units. Starting Period 7, demand dropped significantly. The sequence of demand for Periods 7-10 is 57, 48, 38, and 88. While Period 10 shows a spike to 88, the overall average for this recent 4-period window is 57.75 units, which is a clear departure from the initial high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all orders arriving within the same period they were placed. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the characteristics of this new, lower-demand regime while including the recent volatility seen in Period 10. The on-hand inventory is currently low (24), so the OR backend should trigger an order to rebuild safety stock for the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1786.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand spiked unexpectedly to 146 units, resulting in a stockout (94 units sold, 0 ending inventory). This spike contradicts the previous 'low demand' regime (avg ~48 in periods 7-9). Over the last 5 periods (7-11), the mean demand is (57+48+38+88+146)/5 = 75.4. Given the volatility (ranging from 38 to 146), I will use the last 5 periods to capture this recent increase in both volume and variance. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I set N=5 to balance the low-demand valley and the recent high-demand peaks, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for this renewed volatility to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand volatility significantly increased starting Period 10; previous low-demand regime (avg ~48) replaced by higher, more variable demand (avg 117 over P10-P11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1632.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted again. After a low-demand regime (Periods 7-9, avg ~48), the demand jumped significantly starting at Period 10. The last three periods (P10, P11, P12) show demands of 88, 146, and 89, respectively, resulting in a new mean of approximately 108. This is a clear regime shift compared to the previous 'carry-over insight' which noted an average of 48. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods across all historical arrivals. Given the increased volatility in this new regime (standard deviation is roughly 33 over the last 3 periods), I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-variance behavior and prevent stockouts (as seen in Period 11).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 10: Average demand increased from ~48 to ~108 (+125%) with significantly higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3097.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting at Period 10. The average demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) is 124 units (88, 146, 89, 173), which is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~48). In Period 13, demand spiked to 173, leading to a stockout as only 163 units were available. I am on-hand 0 with no in-transit inventory. Promised lead time remains 0, and historical arrivals consistently show 0-period lead time. To address the increased demand and high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 42 for P10-P13), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 173+ peaks while balancing the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. Using N=4 specifically targets the regime change detected at Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 10 confirmed as high-volume and high-variability: P10-P13 average demand is 124 units (up from ~48) with a standard deviation of approximately 42.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 10, moving from a low-demand period (~48 units) to a high-volume, high-variability regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14), demand values were 88, 146, 89, 173, and 103, resulting in a mean of 119.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 36.9. These values align with the carry-over insight from P14. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is 91 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the goal is to maintain a high service level to capture the volatile upside of this new regime. I will use the recent 5-period window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime's characteristics while ignoring the previous low-demand phase.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 10, moving from a low-demand phase (avg ~48) to a high-volume, high-volatility phase. Over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand has averaged 116.5 units, though with substantial fluctuations (ranging from 88 to 173). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 83 units and the high target service level (95% based on profit/holding cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand volatility regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand data. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts seen in Period 11 and 13.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a high-volume, high-variability regime starting at Period 10. While Period 16 showed a sudden drop to 40 units, demand in this regime (P10-P16) has averaged approximately 106 units with significant fluctuations (ranging from 40 to 173). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to the single low data point in Period 16 while acknowledging the regime's inherent volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 (covering the entire high-variability regime from Period 10 to Period 16). This captures the current mean of 106.3 and the elevated standard deviation of approximately 45.8, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the frequent demand spikes observed in this segment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2003.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the high-volume, high-variability regime established around Period 10. Excluding the low-demand valley from Period 7-9, the more recent periods (P10-P17) show a mean demand of approximately 107 units per period, but with significant swings (e.g., 173 in P13 followed by 40 in P16). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this volatility while weighting recent high-demand observations (P17 demand was 109), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P10-P17). This N is chosen to isolate the current high-volatility regime and provide a representative mean (approx 107) and standard deviation for the OR engine to buffer against the seen spikes while avoiding over-stocking during the occasional drops like P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1048.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that began around Period 10. While the average demand from P10-P18 is approximately 101 units, the variance is significant with values ranging from 40 to 173. The last three periods (P16-P18) have shown lower demand (40, 109, 61), averaging 70 units, but this follows a peak of 100+ earlier. Given the wide fluctuations and the stock-out events in P11 and P13, it is safer to use a slightly longer window to capture the volatility of this regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to cover the entirety of this high-volatility period (P10-P18), ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated from the current regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by all historical arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with no clear stable mean since Period 10. Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), demand has ranged from 40 to 173 with an average of approximately 98.9 and a standard deviation of 39.5. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show demands of 109, 61, and 80 (avg 83.3), suggesting a slight cooling compared to the P10-P14 peak, but still significantly higher than the P7-P9 low. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this high-variability 'new normal' while remaining responsive to the recent data, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=10 for mu_hat captures the full scope of the high-variance regime starting at P10, while setting N=10 for sigma_hat reflects the high volatility (standard deviation ~40) observed in this period. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover potential spikes (like the 173 seen in P13) while acknowledging the high service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the demand was 94 units, align with the sustained high-volatility regime that started at Period 10. For Period 21, the current on-hand inventory is 69 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed), so L=0 is maintained. The demand regime from Period 10 to Period 20 (N=11) shows an average demand of approximately 98.4 units with significant fluctuations (ranging from 40 to 173). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 to capture the properties of this current high-variability regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer appropriate for the observed standard deviation, reaching the optimal 95% service level while minimizing holding costs for this specific demand pattern.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 10 to a higher-volume, high-variability state. Over the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the average demand is 98.3, but the volatility remains high with significant fluctuations (ranging from 40 to 173). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the system target service level (q) is approximately 95%, making it critical to buffer against the observed demand spikes to prevent stockouts like those seen in P11 and P13. I am using recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability regime while smoothing recent smaller fluctuations.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-volume, high-variability regime since Period 10. While the peak demand spikes seen earlier (averaging 124 units in P10-P13) have slightly leveled off, the average for the last 13 periods (P10-P22) is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of 36. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, matching the promised lead time. Since the critical ratio (q) is high at 0.95 ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), the priority is ensuring enough stock to cover demand spikes and avoid stockouts. I am setting N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full profile of this current regime while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the high target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2162.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 10. Reviewing the demand from Period 10 to Period 23, the average demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of about 33. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 42 units and there are 0 units in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 0, the OR backend needs to set a base stock that covers the current period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the period from P10 to P23) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the high historical variance (standard deviation ~33) while maintaining a high service level, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% critical fractile).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 10. Over the last 15 periods (P10-P24), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of about 34.6. This is a significant shift from the low-demand period (P7-P9). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (100% arrival rate in the same period for all placed orders except Period 10 where no order was placed). To best capture the current behavior and balance the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target service level ~95%), I am selecting the last 15 periods for the demand and volatility estimates. Setting L=0 explicitly as it is consistently verified. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus 1-period review cycle demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P10-P24): Mean demand ~101, Std Dev ~35. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 10, following an earlier shift. Analyzing the demand from Period 10 to Period 25, the average demand is 101.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving in the same period it was ordered. For Period 26, I will use recent_N with N=16 (the length of the stable regime from P10-P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend captures the current volume and volatility accurately while ignoring the outdated low-demand periods (P7-P9). The high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a high service level, which the base stock policy (using q \u2248 0.95) will naturally provide given these parameters.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 10, despite historical volatility. Recent demand (P22-P26: 131, 116, 106, 88, 91) shows an average of 106.4 units. I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the Period 10-26 stabilized regime) to capture this behavior. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units, and the pipeline is empty. The OR backend with mu_hat and sigma_hat derived from N=17 will naturally aim for a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer based on the observed volatility (Std Dev approx 35 in that period), ensuring high service levels given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the stable regime established around Period 10. In the most recent periods (P25-P27), recorded demand was 88, 91, and 67 units respectively. Calculating the average over the last 18 periods (P10-P27) provides a robust mean of approximately 100.8 units with a standard deviation of 33.9. These statistics are consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 25. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period), as verified by the 'Period 27 conclude' message showing an order from P27 arrived in P27. Since the next decision P28 faces this stable demand, I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture this established regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistent since Period 10, following a high-variability regime. In the most recent window (Periods 25-28), demand has been slightly lower (avg ~81.75) compared to the long-term regime average (~101), but it remains within normal volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent history. I am using a recent_N approach with N=19 (covering Period 10 to present) to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation for the OR backend to calculate the optimal base stock. This balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level while accounting for the significant variability observed since Period 10.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a stable regime since Period 10, characterized by a mean of approximately 98 units and a standard deviation of ~33 units over the last 20 periods (P10-P29). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. Current on-hand inventory is 79 units. Recent demand (P27-P29) has been slightly lower (avg 72), but the overall regime average (last 20 periods) is more robust for parameter setting. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime's statistics while keeping L at the default (promised 0) or using the calculated average (0). Balancing the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost indicates a high service level (~95%) is optimal, which the base-stock policy will maintain using these parameters.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 10, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 35, as noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 25). Recent demands (P26-P30: 91, 67, 81, 69, 111) yield an average of 83.8, suggesting a slight recent softening compared to the long-term regime average, though P30 spiked to 111. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 35 units. To balance the high profit margin ($19) against low holding costs ($1), the OR engine needs to maintain a service level approximately equal to 19/(19+1) = 95%. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable regime starting roughly at Period 11, which provides enough samples to estimate both the mean and volatility accurately while reflecting the current stable demand environment.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand surged to 153 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). The most recent demand regime (Period 25-31) shows a mean of approximately 94.4 units with a standard deviation of 29.5 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs in this higher-volatility environment, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this latest stabilized regime for both mean and standard deviation. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical performance of 0-period arrivals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-volume/high-variability regime that began around Period 10. Recent demand from Period 25 to Period 32 shows a slight upward trend in volatility (P31 demand hit 153), though the mean remains relatively stable around 100-110 units. Specifically, the average demand of the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 102.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period in the history. To handle the recent volatility and prevent stockouts (as seen in P31), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8, capturing the most recent stable yet variable behavior. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 103 units while accounting for the ~28 unit standard deviation observed in this window. With a high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the backend will naturally target a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1551.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but high-variability regime since Period 10. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 98.1 units. Although there was a stockout in Period 31 due to a demand spike of 153, the subsequent recovery and the most recent demand (85 units) suggest that the regime is still consistent with the long-term stabilization noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 0. I will use 'recent_N' for a sample size of 15 (covering P19-P33) to capture the current mean and variance while smoothing out the recent stockout spike. This approach provides a robust base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0), ensuring adequate service levels for this high-variability sku.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 10, but recent periods (P30-P34) show a slight increase in volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 28.5) and a mean of approximately 112.4, which is slightly higher than the P10-P24 average. Current Period 35 begins with an on-hand inventory of 56. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture the most relevant demand characteristics while filtering out the noise from the early periods (P1-P9), I will use the last 20 samples (P15-P34). This captures the stable behavior observed since Period 25 and includes the recent higher-demand spikes (P31, P32). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 0-day lead time history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in the high-volume/high-variability regime established around Period 10. While the Period 25 insight noted a mean of ~101, more recent history (P30-P35) shows a cluster of higher demand periods (153, 129, 85, 84, 84), averaging approximately 107 units with noticeable volatility. To capture this slightly higher and variable demand profile while staying responsive to the most recent data, I am using a recent_N window of 10 periods (P26-P35). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods according to history. Using N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable yet updated forecast that covers the recent stabilization around these levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable within the regime identified around Period 10, though there was a slight dip in the most recent period (P36 demand = 52). Examining the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units with a standard deviation of about 29.5. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is 89 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current stabilized regime while staying responsive to recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to target a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) while managing inventory appropriately for the 0-period lead time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1037.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a potential new downward shift over the last two periods (P36: 52, P37: 59) compared to the long-term stable average of ~101 (P10-P35). While it's too early to confirm a permanent regime change (only 2 periods), a more responsive forecasting method is needed to avoid overstocking. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by P37's arrival in the same period. I will use EWMA with a gamma of 0.3 to weigh recent observations more heavily while still considering historical context, as this allows the model to adjust quickly to the recent lower demand levels without over-reacting to a two-point signal. L is set to calculate as it accurately captures the consistent 0-period lead time history. Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility accurately.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a moderate decline in mean compared to the high-volume regime noted around Period 25. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P31-P38) show a mean demand of approximately 91.3 units, down from the earlier average of 101. However, volatility remains present (e.g., P31 demand of 153). The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to hold based on recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current mean of ~91 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent variability and ensure a defensive buffer against potential stockouts like the one seen in Period 31. The OR backend will use these with the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) to calculate the order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2493.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate within the established regime that began at Period 10. In the most recent periods (P30-P39), demand has shown high variability, with a peak of 153 and a low of 52. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 97.4, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 25 stating a mean of ~101. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To balance the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (high critical ratio), I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the full stability of the post-Period 10 regime, which includes the higher volatility observed recently. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to cover demand peaks (like the 132 units in Period 39) while minimizing the risk of stockouts which occurred in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1593.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but high-volatility regime since Period 10. Over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is approximately 91.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 28.5. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no evidence of delays or losses. In Period 40, demand was 87, and the ending on-hand inventory is 60. To maintain a safe service level given the high volatility and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which suggests a target service level of ~95%), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 15 periods of data (N=15). This captures the current demand regime more accurately than long-term historical data while remaining robust to recent fluctuations.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but high-volatility regime since Period 10. The average demand since Period 25 is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of 34 units. Period 41 ended with 0 inventory after a high demand of 146 units (stockout of 8 units). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 95%. I will use the recent period data starting from the stabilization point at Period 25 (N=17) to provide the most relevant mean and volatility estimates for the current environment. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in Periods 31 and 41.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2716.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P39-P42) shows a significant increase, with samples of 132, 87, 146, and 143 (average ~127). This is a shift from the previous average of ~101 identified in Carry-over Insights for P25. Current on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) due to high demand in P41 and P42 nearly exhausting stock. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time remains 0, I will use recent demand data to capture this upward movement. I'll set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically target this latest high-demand window (P39-P42) and ensure the base stock is high enough to avoid further stockouts in this more volatile period. The lead time L remains at 'default' (0) as history consistently confirms immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Average demand increased from ~101 to ~127 (+25%) based on samples from P39-P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2608.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 39. In the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has been: 132, 87, 146, 143, and 139. This averages approximately 129.4 units per period, a substantial increase from the previous average of ~101. The volatility is also elevated. Using a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-volume/high-variability state accurately for the current period's order. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages (P43 order arrived in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 33, and there is no in-transit stock. Setting parameters based on the last 5 samples (N=5) allows the OR engine to establish a base stock that covers this higher demand floor and mitigates the risk of stockouts seen in Period 41.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: P39-P43 average demand increased to ~129 (from ~101) with sustained higher levels (>130 in 4 out of 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1430.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 39. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged 121.1 units, but with a high level of variability (individual observations: 132, 87, 146, 143, 139, 80). Although the Period 44 demand was lower (80), the preceding periods consistently exceeded 130, justifying a higher safety stock level. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding in the same period it was placed. To capture the current higher-volume/high-volatility regime while being responsive to the most recent evidence, I am using recent_N with N=6 (covering P39-P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses parameters reflecting the current 120+ unit average and the associated variance to maintain a high service level for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime shift identified at Period 39 continues to hold, with demand averaging approximately 119 units over the last 7 periods (P39-P45). While Period 44 saw a dip to 80 units, Period 45 returned to a more typical level of 107 units. The actual lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history, matching the promised lead time. For the OR engine, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime (post-P39) while filtering out the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~119) and the observed volatility of this period, maintaining the 95% service level goal given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift at Period 39. Over the last 8 periods (P39-P46), the mean demand has increased to approximately 111 units, which is a significant change from the previous baseline. However, recent demand (P44-P46) has shown lower values (80, 107, 55), suggesting a potential stabilization or slight cooling of that peak. In Period 46, demand was particularly low at 55. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime while respecting the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this observed stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-168.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand dropped to 0, which is highly unusual even for this high-variability regime. Looking back at P39-P47, the average demand is 114 with a high standard deviation (approx 44). The zero demand in P47 significantly pulls down most recent averages, but it is likely an outlier or a very brief dip. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level (~95% quantile) is optimal to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the last confirmed shift (P39), treating P47 as part of the volatility of this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly at Period 47: Demand dropped to 0 units despite previous average of ~129; monitoring to see if this is a new low-regime or a one-off outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2040.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand returned to a significant level (111 units) after the anomaly of 0 demand in Period 47. This confirms that Period 47 was likely a one-off outlier rather than a permanent regime shift. The current demand regime (starting Period 39) has shown higher volume, though Period 46 (55) and Period 48 (111) show increased volatility. I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current regime (P39-P48) while smoothing out the Period 47 zero-demand outlier. On-hand inventory is 69 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the higher volume and recent volatility to maximize profit while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Period 47 demand (0 units) confirmed as a one-off outlier; demand returned to previous levels in Period 48 (111).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1483.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volume regime that began around Period 39. Although Period 47 saw a demand of 0, Periods 48 (111) and 49 (83) confirm this was a transitory outlier rather than a regime shift. Over the most recent stable high-volume window (P39-P46, P48-P49), excluding the outlier, the average demand is 113.6 units with significant variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. I'm using a recent window of 11 samples (P39-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while smoothing out the single outlier at P47. This allows the OR engine to maintain a sufficient safety stock for the high-profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) environment.
