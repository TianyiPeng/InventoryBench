The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 131 units (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). The drop in Period 5 (69) might be an outlier or a shift, but without further context, I will treat the average demand around 130-140 units as the baseline. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in the current period and is available for this period's demand. To satisfy the expected demand of ~130 units and provide a small buffer for variance (since on-hand is currently 0), I will target an order of 150 units.
