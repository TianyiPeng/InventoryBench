Given the lead time is 0, the order arrives and is used to satisfy demand in the same period. Total inventory available to satisfy Period 39 demand will be (On-hand 26 + Order Qty). 4. **Adjustment**: Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some periodic fluctuation but generally averages around 100.

Recent demand (P43-P47): 107, 126, 105, 102, 31.\n   - There was a significant drop in demand in Period 47 (31 units), which followed a steady period of demand around 100-110 units.\n\n3. **Strategy**: \n   - We are at Period 48 of 50. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 48 demand.\n   - The OR recommendation is 31 units. This recommendation is likely influenced by the recent low demand observation in Period 47. \n   - Given the current inventory of 103 and the sudden drop in demand, we need to be careful not to overstock as we approach the end of the game (Period 50) and minimize holding costs.\n   - If demand reverts to the recent mean (~105), we need 105 units total (including on-hand). If demand stays low (~31), 103 units is already plenty.\n   - Order calculation: If we expect demand to be ~105, we need 105 - 103 = 2 units. The OR suggests 31, aiming for a higher safety stock. However, a middle ground of following the OR's 31 units ensures we have 134 units available, providing a buffer if demand recovers to its previous levels (avg ~100) while keeping ending inventory manageable.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: Historical data (P1-P48) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. 2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current on-hand inventory is 72 units. There are no units in transit. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has slowed (P47: 31, P48: 62) compared to the long-term average (~100). The current on-hand inventory of 72 units is sufficient to cover approximately one period of average demand. 4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommendation of 61 units targets a base stock level of roughly 133-134 (On-hand 72 + Order 61 = 133). 5. **Game Context**: We are in Period 49 of 50. This is the final ordering period that will result in sales (since orders arrive same-period L=0). Any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will only incur holding costs. 6. **Decision**: Following the OR recommendation of 61 units aligns with the historical 'target stock' of ~134 observed in many successful periods (e.g., P40-P47 starting inventories were all 134-135). This provides safety against a demand spike in the penultimate period while minimizing excess stock for the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation of 68 units for Period 50 is based on a base-stock level targeting approximately 132-140 units of total inventory (on-hand + in-transit). Since on-hand is currently 64 and lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods (meaning the order arrives and is available for sale in the same period), ordering 68 units will bring the starting inventory for Period 50 to 132 units. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has mostly fluctuated between 31 and 171, with the most recent periods (P48-P49) showing demand in the 60s. An inventory level of 132 units provides a safety buffer that covers the recent historical mean while limiting high holding costs. Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, there is no need to carry inventory into a future period. The goal is to maximize profit by meeting demand while minimizing ending inventory. Ordering 68 to reach a total of 132 units is a balanced approach, though demand could occasionally exceed this value, the current holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) ratio justifies not over-stocking excessively at the very end.",
