The profit per unit ($1.0) is equal to the holding cost per unit ($1.0), resulting in a Critical Ratio of 0.5. At this ratio, the optimal stocking level typically aligns with the mean or median to balance the risks of stockouts and excess inventory costs. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive during this period's resolution phase to satisfy this period's demand. I will order 160 units to align with the historical average and satisfy the immediate demand for Period 1.",
