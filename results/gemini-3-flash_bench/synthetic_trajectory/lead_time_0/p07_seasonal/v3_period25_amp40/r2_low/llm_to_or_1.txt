Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The historical demand data (Periods 1-5 provided: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average demand of approximately 158 units per period. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no prior carry-over or calendar events to adjust for, I will use the mean of the available historical samples (N=5) to establish initial parameters. L is set to default (0). mu_hat will be estimated based on the last 5 samples to capture the recent mean, and sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to capture recent volatility. Given Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level (q) target is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will aim to cover the median demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 138 units, which is close to the first sample provided (118) but slightly higher. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory starts Period 2 at 20 units. Looking at the five historical demand samples [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], there is a slight upward trend or at least a higher mean than the first period's performance. The average of the 5 samples is 158. Since L=0, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use the mean of the available samples (158) as the estimate for mu_hat and the standard deviation of these samples (~33.5) for sigma_hat. Since N is small (5 samples), using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will effectively reflect these 5 samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in those same periods). Demand for P1 was 138 and P2 was 121 (averaging 129.5). Historical samples provided in the prompt (P1: 118, P2: 153, P3: 211, P4: 153, P5: 155) suggest a significantly higher mean (approx 158) than what we have experienced in the game so far. Specifically, P3 is forecasted to have a demand of 211. Since on-hand inventory is low (34 units) and there is 0 in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the forecasted spike in P3. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the OR engine will target the mean demand. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the specific P3 forecast of 211 units, adjusted for L=0 (total mu = (1+L)*forecast = 211). For sigma, I will use 'default' to capture the variability shown across all historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)': P1=138, P2=121, P3=113 (Note: The user provided demand list says 118, 153, 211, but the game history conclude messages show actual demand was 138, 121, 113. I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages as ground truth for what happened). The mean demand over the first 3 periods is ~124 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (P1-P3) confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory is currently 98 units. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Since demand appears relatively stable with a slight downward trend, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current mean and variability. This will set the base stock to cover Period 4's demand, adjusted for the 98 units currently on hand.

Daily Profit: $74.00, Daily Holding Cost: $50.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by history, as orders placed in Periods 1-4 all arrived in the same period. Demand has shown a downward trend from Period 1 to Period 4 (138, 121, 113, 74). The historical samples provided at the start (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) seem to represent a different distribution than the actual observed demand in the game history. Given the recent drop in demand in Period 4 (74), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the game's actual realized demand levels while smoothing the recent volatility. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will likely be closer to the mean demand. I'll stick to 'default' for L as 0 is stable.

Daily Profit: $112.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we experienced a stockout because demand (142) exceeded our starting inventory (112), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods is currently holding true, as per the history of Period 1 through Period 5. The demand history shows: P1:138, P2:121, P3:113, P4:74, P5:142. The average demand across all 5 periods is 117.6 units. Since we are at 0 inventory and there is no in-transit stock, our order must cover the upcoming period's demand (L+1 = 1 period) plus a safety stock. The OR backend uses p/(p+h) to determine service level; here profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), leading to a critical fractile of 0.5 (z=0), meaning it aims for the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (all available data) to capture the trend, while using 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure some safety margin is computed based on historical variance to prevent another stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the item chips(Regular) stocked out again, with demand (157) significantly exceeding the inventory available (118). Over the last 6 periods, demand has shown a slight upward trend despite some volatility (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157). The last two periods show a significant step up in demand compared to the mid-period dip. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we should aim for the median demand. However, given the lost sales in the last two periods (P5 and P6), the 'samples' provided in the prompt (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) seem to represent a different distribution or prior compared to the actual sequence of demand observed in history (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157). I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture the upward shift to ~137.6 units/period to prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (H=P).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 5: average increased from ~111 (P1-P4) to ~149.5 (P5-P6), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 5. For the last three periods (P5, P6, P7), we have experienced stockouts because demand (142, 157, 132) has consistently exceeded both our starting on-hand inventory and our recent orders. The average demand over these three periods is 143.67, significantly higher than the average of 111.5 from periods 1-4. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the history. To address the stockouts and capture the current demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to focus on this new higher-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility. This should raise the base stock level sufficiently to prevent further lost sales while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~111 to ~144 (+30%) over periods 5-7, causing three consecutive periods of stockouts (P5-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9. The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 5. Historical demand for P1-P4 averaged ~111.5, whereas P5-P8 has averaged ~153.75, with a peak of 184 in P8. This surge has resulted in four consecutive periods of stockouts (P5-P8), meaning the 'sold' quantity is equal to the available inventory, and true demand is likely higher than recorded sales. Total inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from stockouts and adjust to this new regime, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current period. Given the recent stockouts, mu_hat will use N=4 (spanning the high demand period) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Mean demand increased from ~111.5 (P1-P4) to ~153.75 (P5-P8), a ~38% increase, causing four consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 5. The initial mean (P1-P4) was approximately 111.5 units, but from P5 to P9, the mean demand rose to approximately 150.8 units (142, 157, 132, 184, 139), representing a ~35% increase. This shift caused consecutive stockouts from P5 to P8. In Period 9, the demand was 139, which was finally met with 15 units of ending inventory, indicating that our previous 'explicit' adjustments are beginning to catch up. However, the volatility has also increased (standard deviation of P5-P9 is ~19.8). The lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue to focus on the recent demand regime (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 captures the post-shift behavior accurately while allowing the OR backend to balance the high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($1) using the actual data from the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized around 150 units from P5-P9 (compared to 111 in P1-P4), with increased volatility. Stockouts were resolved in P9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting in Period 5, moving from a mean of ~112 (P1-P4) to a higher mean of ~150 (P5-P9). Period 10 shows a significant drop in demand to 85 units, which may be a one-off fluctuation or the start of a cooling period. Since specific calendar info is not provided, I will treat Period 10 with caution but recognize it pulls the mean down. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (W = X - Z) is consistently 0 (e.g., P10 order arrived P10). Stockouts from P5-P8 have been resolved as of P9. Using N=6 for mu_hat (P5-P10) to capture the higher-demand regime while including the recent dip. Using N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the history. The target service level (q) is 0.5 (Profit=1/(1+1)), so the backend will target the median demand (mu_hat).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear regime shift. Early demand (P1-P4) averaged ~111.5. A significant hike occurred from P5 to P9, averaging approximately 151 units, which led to multiple stockouts. However, demand in the most recent two periods (P10: 85, P11: 114) has cooled significantly, averaging 99.5. This suggests the high-demand regime may be Ending or moving into a more volatile phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the P5-P9 spike while still covering potential volatility, I will use a recent window of 7 periods (P5-P11) which covers both the spike and the recent cooldown. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a mean of approximately 136 units/period. Given the high volatility observed (range 85-184), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this increased standard deviation and ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling: After a spike averaging ~151 (P5-P9), the last two periods (P10-P11) averaged 99.5, suggesting a return toward baseline or increased volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown two distinct regimes: an initial lower demand phase (P1-P4, mean ~111), followed by a high-demand spike (P5-P9, mean ~151) which caused several stockouts. Since P10, demand has cooled significantly, with the last three periods (P10-P12) recording 85, 114, and 105 respectively, averaging 101.3. This suggests either a return to the original baseline or a new low-demand regime. L is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this cooled demand phase, while keeping sigma_hat at a recent_N of 8 to capture the volatility observed both during the spike and the subsequent drop, ensuring the OR backend maintains a buffer for the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Mean demand for P10-P12 is 101.3, a ~33% decrease from the P5-P9 peak of 151, returning close to P1-P4 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a cooling period. The high-demand regime (P5-P9) averaged ~151 units, while the most recent four periods (P10-P13) have averaged 99.25 units (85, 114, 105, 93), which aligns with the initial baseline. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout history. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock equal to the mean demand over the lead + review period (1+L). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized 'cooled' demand level and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This approach prevents over-ordering based on the previous high-demand spike while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current mean demand of ~100 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the peak observed between Periods 5-9 (average ~151). Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the actual demand has been 85, 114, 105, 93, and 74, resulting in a mean of 94.2. This confirms the 'cooling' noted in earlier periods. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level (especially since holding cost and profit are equal at $1.0), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this current demand level and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that reflects the current mean (~94) and standard deviation rather than the historical spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P10-P14 mean demand is 94.2, compared to the P5-P9 peak of 151 and P1-P4 baseline of 111.5.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10. The mean demand for the last six periods (P10-P15) is 93.8, significantly lower than the P5-P9 peak of 150.8 and even lower than the initial P1-P4 baseline of 111.5. Observations show that actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring an order to cover the upcoming demand. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stable regime. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level targets the median (q=0.5), which helps minimize total cost by avoiding excessive holding while demand is low.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the peak from P5-P9. From P10 to P16, demand has averaged 91.86 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80). This is a significant drop from the 151 average seen during the spike and is even slightly lower than the initial baseline (P1-P4). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for every period in the history. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current, stable lower-demand regime while excluding the high-variance spike data from earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P10-P16 mean demand is 91.9 units, compared to the P5-P9 peak of 151 and P1-P4 baseline of 111.5.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 10. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 90.5 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81), which is significantly lower than the P5-P9 peak of 151 and closer to the initial baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 10, the demand has been relatively stable with moderate volatility (standard deviation of ~13 units). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime, aligning inventory levels with current market reality while ensuring enough safety stock to cover the observed volatility. Holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), so the target service level is 50% for the base stock calculation, which the OR backend will handle naturally.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 10. For the last 9 periods (P10-P18), mean demand is approximately 92 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81, 84), which is significantly lower than the P5-P9 peak of ~150. Given the consistent standard deviation in this period, N=9 is chosen to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time L=0 has been consistently observed in all 18 periods (orders arrive same-period), so L is set to 'default'. Current on-hand inventory is low (7), so the backend needs accurate recent statistics to maintain the service level (q=0.5 where profit=holding) while preventing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the most recent period (Period 19), with demand dropping to 38, which is less than half the average of the preceding low-regime period (P10-P18 mean was ~91). While one period is not a trend, the 'Carry-over Insights' already noted a stabilization around 90-100 following a peak of 150. Given the current on-hand inventory of 52 units and the recent demand of 38, I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=10, covering P10-P19) to ensure we don't over-order if the demand is indeed slowing further. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting N=10 for mu_hat captures the lower demand stability observed since Period 10, averaging 84.6 units per period, which aligns with the current context and helps avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a 50% service level target (Profit $1.0 / (Profit $1.0 + Holding $1.0)).

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially shifting significantly lower: Period 19 demand was 38, following a stable regime of ~92 (P10-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high degree of volatility following a period of stability (~92 units in P10-P18). Period 19 saw a sharp drop to 38 units, followed by a rebound to 82 units in Period 20. Given the on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (3 units), we must set parameters that respond to the return of standard demand levels while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To calculate mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 to capture the regime that started around Period 10, which averages approximately 86 units per period. This covers the cooling trend and the recent volatile periods. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=11 to ensure the variance calculation reflects the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 19: Demand dropped to 38 (P19) then returned to 82 (P20), deviating from the stable ~92 unit mean observed in P10-P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility (P19-P20). The demand in P21 was 76 units, following 82 units in P20, suggesting the demand is settling back into the established regime observed between P10 and P18. I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent_N of 12 (covering P10-P21) to capture this stable regime of ~90 units/period while accounting for the recent low outlier in P19. The sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=12 to reflect the recent variance. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed in history, and the backend logic for base_stock calculation (q=0.5 since Profit=Holding=$1.0) will handle the balance between service level and holding cost for this single-period lead time product.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for P10-P21 is 85.3 units, confirming a return to a lower stable level after the P5-P9 peak (~151).

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 13 periods (P10-P22), the demand has stabilized significantly compared to the earlier spike (P5-P9). The mean demand for this recent stable period is approximately 83 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. In the most recent period (P22), demand was 66 units, which is slightly below the recent average but within the normal variance. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the equal weight of profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level corresponds to a 50% quantile (z=0), which effectively targets the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this stabilized regime (P10-P22) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=13 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' given the consistent arrival pattern.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P20-P23) shows a consistent downward trend (82, 76, 66, 55), confirming the shift noted in Period 22. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is 69.75, which is significantly lower than the P10-P18 average of ~92. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 4 periods to capture this downward trajectory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift lower confirmed: Period 20-23 mean demand is ~70 units, a ~24% decrease from the previous P10-P18 stable regime of ~92.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted lower over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), with a mean of approximately 77.2 units. While P24 saw a sudden spike to 107 units, resulting in a stockout, the overall trend from P20 onwards is lower than the previous stable mean of ~92. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently observed in the history. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent downward-trending but volatile regime while adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the P24 spike and ensure the OR backend orders enough to prevent a repeat stockout. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate the base stock near the median demand of the recent window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after a lower regime shift; P24 demand spiked to 107 (+52% from P23) causing a stockout after 4 periods of lower demand (mean ~69).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand was 89 units, which followed a spike to 107 in Period 24. This has resulted in two consecutive stockouts as current inventory levels (on-hand = 0) were insufficient. While demand for Periods 20-23 averaged ~70, the last two periods averaged ~98, indicating a shift away from the low regime back toward the long-term stable mean of ~92 seen in P10-P18. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but given the recent stockouts, I must ensure mu_hat reflects the higher recent volatility. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the low dip (P20-23) through the current spike (P24-25). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 24-25 demand averaged 98 units, ending the lower regime of ~70 (P20-23) and returning to the previous baseline of ~92 (P10-18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift and high volatility. After a period of lower demand (P20-P23 avg ~70), the last three periods (P24-P26) have seen demand of 107, 89, and 139, averaging ~111.7 units. This return to higher demand has resulted in three consecutive stockouts because the OR system's base stock was likely calibrated to a lower regime. The current 'on-hand' is 0. To capture this shift and ensure sufficient stock while balancing holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the model to the recent spike (mean ~112) and the significantly increased volatility (standard deviation of {107, 89, 139} is approximately 25). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward: P24-P26 demand averaged ~112 units, causing three consecutive stockouts and ending the previous low-demand regime (~70).

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upward again. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P24-P27), demand values were 107, 89, 139, and 105, resulting in an average of 110. This is significantly higher than the preceding low-demand regime (P20-P23) which averaged ~70. We have experienced three stockouts in the last four periods due to this sudden surge. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this new elevated regime while maintaining enough volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against the high variance observed (e.g., the jump to 139 in P26). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift upward confirmed: P24-P27 mean demand is 110 units (up from ~70 in P20-P23), resulting in stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another regime shift upward, starting around Period 24. For the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 118.4 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152), which is significantly higher than the preceding low-demand regime of ~70 units (P20-P23) and even the stable regime of ~92 units (P10-P18). This shift has caused stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods (P24, P25, P26, P28). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. The target inventory level needs to increase to meet this higher demand and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward significantly: P24-P28 mean demand is 118.4 (up ~70% from P20-P23), resulting in stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 24. For the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 126.3 units, compared to the previous low-demand regime of ~70 units (P20-23) and the medium regime of ~92 units (P10-P18). This surge has resulted in 5 stockouts in the last 6 periods. The most recent demand (P29) hit a peak of 166 units. Given a lead time of 0 (consistently observed), I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-volume, high-volatility regime to prevent further stockouts. I will use a N=6 period window for recent_N to capture this specific upward trend (starting P24) which includes the recent demand levels of 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, and 166.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward continues to intensify: P24-P29 mean demand is 126.3 units, with the last two periods (P28-P29) exceeding 150 units, resulting in stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 24. For the most recent regime (P24-P30), the average demand is approximately 124.7 units, compared to the previous low regime of ~70 (P20-P23) and the prior stable baseline of ~92 (P10-P18). Over the last three periods (P28-P30), demand has averaged 144.3 units, leading to frequent stockouts (5 out of the last 7 periods). Although demand dropped slightly to 115 in Period 30, it remains high. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime that began at Period 24, and recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this period. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current upward trend and protects against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed: P24-P30 mean demand is 124.7 units (up ~78% from P20-P23 mean of 70). High demand persists with stockouts in 5 of the last 7 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward starting around Period 24. Since then, the average demand has been approximately 124.5 units (P24-P31), compared to the previous low regime of ~70. Recent periods (P28-P29) even saw spikes above 150. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P24-P31) to capture this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this upward shift. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. This approach aims to minimize the frequent stockouts observed in the last 8 periods (5 out of 8 periods) by aligning base stock levels with the current high-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly starting Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has averaged approximately 124 units (P24-P32), which is a substantial increase from the prior low regime of ~70 units. Recent periods (P28-P32) have shown even higher volatility and peaks, with demand hitting 152, 166, and 131 units respectively, causing frequent stockouts (ending Period 32 with 0 on-hand). To capture this high-demand regime and ensure higher service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9, covering the entire period since the most recent changepoint at Period 24. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, but the base stock must be elevated to handle the recent demand spikes and prevent further stockouts in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward significantly: P24-P32 mean demand is 125.2 units, a ~79% increase from the P20-P23 mean of 70. This regime is characterized by high volatility and frequent stockouts (6 out of the last 9 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 24. For the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 125.8 units, compared to the previous low regime of ~70 units (P20-P23) and the even earlier baseline of ~92 units. There have been frequent stockouts (7 out of the last 10 periods), indicating the previous inventory targets were insufficient to handle the higher mean and increased volatility. Since the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (as confirmed by the 'conclude' messages), I am focusing on capturing this new demand regime. I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to reflect this current high-demand state while incorporating the recent volatility into the sigma calculation to better buffer against stockouts. This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock level appropriate for the current demand mean of ~125-130 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward sustained: P24-P33 mean demand is ~125.8 units (up from ~70 in P20-P23), with stockouts in 7 of the last 10 periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly around Period 24 and has remained elevated. Over the last 11 periods (P24-P34), the mean demand is approximately 124 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131, 131, 104), which is a clear departure from the previous low-demand regime of ~70 (P20-P23) and the medium-demand regime (~92). Although Period 34 saw a slight dip to 104, the overall trend supports keeping mu_hat aligned with the recent mean to avoid further stockouts (which occurred in 7 of the last 11 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I am using recent_N=11 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime for both mean and volatility calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime continues to be elevated and volatile since Period 24. For the most recent 12-period window (P24-P35), mean demand is approximately 126.8 units. The last period (P35) showed a significant spike to 149 units, depleting all inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this higher sustained demand level (approx. 127 units) while providing a buffer for the observed high volatility (stdev in this regime is approx. 20-25), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on this current regime. Setting N=12 captures the shift that started in P24 while providing enough data points to stabilize \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 against the frequent stockouts and spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward sustained through Period 35: Mean demand for P24-P35 is 126.8 units (up ~81% from P20-P23 mean of 70). High demand persists with stockouts in 8 of the last 12 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime that began around Period 24. Since then (P24-P36), the mean demand is approximately 125.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous low-demand period (P20-P23) and even higher than the initial baseline. In the most recent periods (P34-P36), demand has fluctuated between 104 and 149, with a mean of 122.3. Given the frequent stockouts in this regime (8 out of the last 13 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full scope of this current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This period count covers the volatility and the mean shift since the onset of the current trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent '0 periods' arrivals in the history, so I will maintain the 'default' lead time setting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the elevated phase that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, the mean demand has been approximately 124 units, which is a significant increase from the previous low (Period 20-23 mean ~70). The most recent three periods (P35-P37) show demand of 149, 114, and 90, maintaining this higher average albeit with high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period). To capture this sustained higher demand level while reflecting recent fluctuations, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 (covering P24 to P37). This N captures the entirety of the current high-demand regime, providing a stable yet representative forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that minimizes stockouts, which were frequent earlier in this regime, while managing holding costs as demand shows signs of potential softening (P37 demand was 90).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly starting at Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 125 units from P24 to P35, compared to 70 units from P20-P23. Over the last three periods (P36-P38), demand has slightly softened (114, 90, 117), averaging 107 units. However, given the high volatility and frequent stockouts in this recent regime, I will use recent_N=15 to capture the high-demand period while slightly weighting the recent moderation. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering P24-P38) ensures we maintain a safety stock appropriate for the current volatility (std dev remains significant).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting P24: P24-P38 mean demand is ~122 units, a ~74% increase from the P20-P23 mean of 70 units. Volatility remains high.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 24. While earlier periods in this regime saw extreme spikes (up to 166 units) and frequent stockouts, the last four periods (P36-P39) have shown slightly more moderate demand (114, 90, 117, 111), averaging approximately 108 units. The overall regime mean desde P24 is still significantly higher at ~121 units compared to the previous low of ~70. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio q = 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime (P24-P39) to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained upward shift and high volatility while smoothing out the most recent moderate fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high-demand state: P24-P39 mean is ~121 units (up from ~70 in P20-P23), with the last 4 periods showing a slightly lower but consistent average of 108 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 24. While earlier spikes in this regime reached averages over 125 units, the more recent data (P37-P40) indicates a slight cooling or stabilization, with demand values of 90, 117, 111, and 70. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 113.6 units, while the mean for the total high-demand regime (P24-P40) is ~118.8. Given the current on-hand inventory of 52 units and the consistent 0-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=17 (covering P24 to P40) to capture the full scope of this current regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR engine maintain a safety stock sufficient to handle the observed variance while accounting for the recent high-demand stabilized state (approx 120 units). Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observe that the high-demand regime (P24-P38 avg ~122) has shifted downward over the last three periods (P39-P41), with demand values of 111, 70, and 58 respectively. The mean for these last three periods is approximately 79.7, which is a significant drop from the previous average. This suggests a return to a lower demand state, similar to the P20-P23 regime (~70). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 61 units with no pipeline. To avoid overstocking while demand is cooling, I am moving to a recent_N calculation for both mean and volatility. I will use N=18 (P24-P41) for mu_hat to capture the broader high-to-low transition but reduce N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased instability during this shift. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling: P39-P41 demand averaged 79.7 units, a ~35% decrease from the P24-P38 average of ~122 units, suggesting a shift away from the high-demand state.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a cooling phase. For the last 4 periods (P39-P42), demand has been 111, 70, 58, and 89, averaging 82 units. This is a significant drop from the high-demand regime (P24-P38) which averaged ~122 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will prioritize the most recent 4 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering during this cooling trend while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation remains significant). Using recent_N=4 aligns the base stock with the current observed mean of ~82 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling confirmed: P39-P42 average demand is 82.0 units, a ~33% decrease from the P24-P38 high of 122 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a lower regime starting from Period 39. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 78.2 units (111, 70, 58, 89, 63), which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime (P24-P38) that averaged ~122 units. This indicates a sustained cooling of demand. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding Cost=$1.0, the critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand to balance the risk of stockouts against carrying costs. Given the clear regime shift, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (approx 78) and the recent volatility, preventing over-ordering based on the older high-demand data. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P39-P43 mean demand is 78.2 units, confirming a ~36% decrease from the P24-P38 peak of 122 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a sustained high-demand period. Since Period 39, mean demand has shifted from approximately 122 units down to 76.2 units (P39-P44). Period 44 demand was 55, continuing this lower trend. Transitioning to a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this cooling trend (P39-P44) more accurately than the long-term average, preventing over-ordering and high holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which is reflected in the 'calculate' method. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower mean and volatility, balancing the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P39-P44 mean demand is 76.2 units, a ~38% decrease from the P24-P38 peak mean of 122 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 39. The most recent demand (P45) was quite low at 37 units. The average demand for the current period regime (P39-P45) is 70.4 units, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime (P24-P38 mean of ~122). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this specific lower-demand regime. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the base stock policy with a 95% cap provides a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P39-P45 mean demand is 70.4 units (a ~42% decrease from the P24-P38 peak of 122 units).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 39. The mean demand from P39 to P46 is approximately 73.1 units, representing a substantial cooling from the previous high-demand peak (P24-P38 mean ~122). Specifically, the last four periods (P43-P46) show remarkably consistent lower demand (63, 55, 37, 78), averaging 58.25 units. Although Period 46 resulted in a minor stockout (78 demand vs 69 on-hand), this was driven more by lean ordering based on previous cooling signals rather than a return to high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the start of the cooling trend in P39) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend captures this lower mean and adjusted volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the high-demand peak (P24-P38). The most recent cooling phase (P39-P47) shows an average demand of approximately 71.8 units. This is significantly lower than the ~122 mean observed previously. The last two periods (P46-P47) resulted in stockouts due to under-ordering in response to the cooling trend, with demand rising slightly back to the ~80 range. I will use a recent_N of 9 periods (P39-P47) to capture this new lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. The OR backend will use these stats to set a base stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 39. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean demand is 68.7 units. The most recent three periods (P46-P48) show an average demand of 68 units (78, 83, 43), confirming this regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With profit and holding cost both at $1.00, the critical ratio q = 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable lower-demand regime while filtering out the previous high-demand volatility (P24-P38). Currently, there are 29 units on hand and 0 in transit. Setting parameters for a 0-period lead time expects the order to arrive and meet the demand in the same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we assess the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The previous high-demand regime (P24-P38, mean ~122) shifted to a lower regime starting around P39. Analysis of the most recent data (P39-P49) shows an average demand of approximately 71.7 units. However, recent periods (P46, P47, P49) have exhibited spikes (78, 83, 105), while others have been quite low (P45=37, P48=43), indicating significantly higher volatility than the earlier baseline. Specifically, the P39-P49 period has a mean of 71.7 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, which means the base stock should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this current regime (P39-P49) for both mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine reacts to the lowered mean while accounting for the increased relative variance compared to the stable periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a moderate-volatility state (P39-P49): Mean demand is 71.7 units, a ~41% decrease from the P24-P38 high of 122 units, but with significantly higher coefficient of variation compared to earlier regimes.
