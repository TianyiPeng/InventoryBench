Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since this is the first period, we have no prior conclude messages to verify lead time, but the promised lead time (L) is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), the average demand is 158 units with a standard deviation of approximately 33.6. Demand showed a spike in Period 3 but has stabilized around 153-155 in the last two samples. Given that L=0, the order cycle covers only the current period (1+L = 1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 158 units plus a safety buffer based on the observed volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 64 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples (118 to 211, mean ~158). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time was 0), confirming the current lead time is 0. Since we only have 123 units on hand and historical demand suggests a mean around 158, we need to ensure we have enough stock for Period 2. However, the Period 1 demand (64) might indicate a downward shift or just a low outlier. Given the limited data after the 'conclude' message, I will use a conservative approach. I'll use 'recent_N' for demand to weight the recent historical samples and include the Period 1 observation (total 6 samples now). With L=0, mu_hat should cover 1 period of demand (1+L). The mean of {118, 153, 211, 153, 155, 64} is 142.33. The OR engine will use this to calculate the base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history for Periods 1 and 2, the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand in Period 1 was 64 and in Period 2 was 87. The provided historical sample data (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests much higher demand than what has been observed in the first two periods of the live simulation. However, since the goal is to maximize total reward and minimize holding costs while covering demand, I will adjust for the observed lower demand while respecting the variability seen in the samples. I will set the lead time (L) to 0 (explicitly confirmed). For mu_hat, I will use a conservative average based on current observations and the lower end of the samples to avoid overstocking, as holding costs are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit ($1:$4 ratio). I'll use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to lean into the current realization of demand (~75 units/period) while the OR backend still considers historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $526.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear upward trend over the last three periods (64, 87, 134). The current on-hand inventory is very low (10 units), and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 0, which has been consistently met so far (observed lead times for P1, P2, and P3 were all 0). Given the sharp increase in demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth while remaining responsive. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher usage levels. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current demand regime and low inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the history; orders placed in Periods 1-4 all arrived in the same period. Demand has been steadily increasing: 64, 87, 134, 127 (averaging 103 over 4 periods). However, the historical demand data provided in the prompt (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests a significantly higher regime than what was actually 'concluded' in the first 4 periods. I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt as it likely represents the true distribution for the current phase. The mean of those 5 samples is 158. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for 1 period (1+L). Using recent_N=5 captures this higher demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the volatility seen in those samples (~34).

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be shifting from an initial lower level (avg ~100) to a higher level as indicated by the historical sample data (avg ~158). Lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $525.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is very low at 11 units. Historically, demand has shown a significant upward trend (Period 1: 64, P2: 87, P3: 134, P4: 127, P5: 134). The provided 'Historical Demand Data' sample set (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests even higher potential demand than observed in the 'Game History' for the first 5 periods. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent history to capture the current demand level. Using N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the recent stabilization around 130-134 units while still accounting for the volatility shown in the sample data (P3 high of 211). This ensures we buffer enough to prevent the stockout seen in Period 4 and meet the rising demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a higher level (averaging 131.7 over last 3 periods) compared to initial periods, confirming the shift noted in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows a stable promised and actual lead time of 0. Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) and recent realized demand (P4: 127, P5: 134, P6: 125) confirm a demand regime shift to a higher mean compared to the very first periods. The average demand over the last 3 concluded periods (P4-P6) is 128.67, which is consistent with the demand samples provided. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher-demand regime while filtering out the initial noise. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the 0-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system faced a stockout as demand (148) exceeded available inventory (138), confirming that demand is currently higher than previous estimates. Demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 134, 127, 134, 125, 148) averages 133.6 units, compared to the initial two periods average of 75.5. This represents a sustained regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for slightly higher volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods of data (N=5) and using the same window for sigma_hat to capture the recent variance in this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~134 units from Period 3 onwards (+77% from initial levels). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The demand history shows a clear regime shift after Period 2. Periods 1-2 had demand (64, 87), while Periods 3-8 show a higher sustained demand: [134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126], averaging approximately 132.3 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock levels appropriately cover the (1+L) = 1 period of demand required to maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs on the 16 units currently on hand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 3-9) shows a clear regime shift where average demand has stabilized at approximately 131 units, compared to the initial periods. However, Period 9 saw a significant drop to 91 units. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 0, the backend should focus on the recent regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the demand behavior since Period 3, while allowing the slightly lower demand in Period 9 to adjust the forecast downward moderately but not excessively. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 25. Historical data shows demand is relatively stable but exhibits a regime shift observed since Period 3. Comparing early periods (Period 1-2 avg 75.5) to recent periods (Period 3-10 avg 122.75). The last three periods show demand of 126, 91, and 117 (avg 111.3), showing a slight cooling from the mid-teens peak, but remaining significantly higher than the start. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 as confirmed in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1 through 10. Given the stability of the new higher demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean (approx 123) and sigma_hat to capture the associated volatility. I will maintain L at default as 0 is consistently achieved.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. Looking at the last 9 periods (Period 3 to Period 11), the mean demand is approximately 124.6 units per period. The recent demand values are 91, 117, and 123. Lead time (L) is consistently 0, as confirmed by all concluded periods. To optimize the base stock calculation, I am using a recent_N window of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the current stable regime and filters out the significantly lower demand observed in the first two periods. This allows the OR backend to calculate a safety stock that balances the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio = 0.8) against the observed volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a significant drop in demand (41 units) compared to the established regime mean (~130 units). However, looking at the history, similar fluctuations occurred in Period 1 (64) and Period 2 (87) before stabilizing. The demand in Period 9 (91) also showed some volatility. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', this could be a random negative fluctuation rather than a permanent regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0. Since the current on-hand inventory is high (98) due to the low demand in Period 12, I will keep parameters relatively stable to avoid over-reacting while still accounting for the recent volatility. I will use recent_N=10 to encompass the stable period (Periods 3-12) while gradually incorporating the low outlier from Period 12.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime that was established around Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 through Period 13 (excluding Period 12 as a potential low outlier with a demand of 41), the average demand is approximately 125 units per period. I am using a recent_N window of 11 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently supported by the history, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Therefore, I'll set L to 'default'. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' for the same 11-period window to accurately reflect the observed volatility in this current demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 3. Initial demand in Periods 1-2 averaged ~75, but from Period 3 onwards, the average demand is approximately 115.5 units per period. However, there is a recent increase in volatility, with demand dropping to 41 (P12) and 90 (P14), while remaining higher in other periods. To capture this stabilized but more volatile regime while responding to recent fluctuations, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 (covering the post-shift period from P3 to P14). This balances the higher average seen since the shift with the recent variability, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for both the mean (~116) and the observed variance to maximize profit while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 3 with an average of ~116 (up from ~75), but shows increased period-to-period volatility between Period 12 and 14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 16, current on-hand inventory is 52. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). Demand analysis: after an early spike (Periods 3-8 avg ~130+), demand has recently softened and become more volatile. Periods 9-15 show an average demand of approximately 95 units (ranging from 41 to 123). Given this recent variance, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this lower but more volatile demand regime (Periods 9-15). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). By using N=7, the backend will calculate a mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) based on the most relevant recent history to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand and safety stock while minimizing holding costs on the 52 units already held.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend in recent periods (P14-P16: 90, 87, 64). Comparing the mean demand of the last 5 periods (~80 units) to the broader post-shift mean of ~116 (P3-P15), there is evidence of a cooling market or a secondary regime shift. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all concluded periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent deceleration. The on-hand inventory of 56 units is relatively high given the lower recent demand, so a more conservative mu_hat will help normalize stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed from Period 14-16: average demand dropped to ~80 units compared to previous stability at ~116 (P3-P13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 114 units, which is higher than the average of the previous three periods (P14-P16 avg: ~80) and caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). However, it remains within the broader post-P3 regime range (~75-150). The 'deceleration' noted in the previous insight from P14-P16 seems to have been a temporary dip rather than a sustained new regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts (as seen in P17) with holding costs, I will use a recent window that captures the post-fluctuation behavior. Using N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~91) and sigma_hat (std ~21) provides a conservative buffer that accounts for the recent demand volatility while acknowledging the shift from the multi-period lows.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a deceleration compared to the high-demand regime observed from Period 3-13. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 83 units (90, 87, 64, 114, 60), whereas the previous regime averaged around 116 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed and delivered same period). To optimize inventory levels and avoid overstocking while maintaining a 0.8 service level (calculated as Profit/(Profit+Holding) = 4/5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this lower-demand regime. This provides a more responsive forecast to the recent trend than using the full historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed from Period 14-18: average demand dropped to ~83 units compared to previous stability at ~116 (P3-P13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand was 57, confirming a sustained lower demand regime that began around Period 14. Over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), the average demand is approximately 78.6 units (90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57), significantly lower than the previous average of ~116 seen from P3-P13. The Lead Time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this lower demand while managing inventory efficiently, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility of this lower-demand period. This will allow the base stock calculation to align with the current lower sales volumes, reducing the risk of excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower from Period 14-19: average demand is ~79 units compared to previous stability at ~116 (P3-P13), a decrease of approx 32%.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower-volume regime that began around Period 14. The average demand from Period 14 to Period 20 is approximately 78 units, compared to the previous regime of ~116 (P3-P13). This confirms a sustained deceleration of about 32%. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To align the OR backend with this lower demand and maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the Period 14-20 regime). This will reduce inventory levels to match current demand trends and minimize holding costs while avoiding stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained shift to a lower demand regime. Since Period 14, the average demand has dropped to approximately 78 units, compared to the earlier higher average (~116). Period 21 saw a particularly low demand of 36, which suggests either continued high volatility or a potential further downward trend. Given the high stock-out cost relative to holding cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a service level around 80% is targeted by the OR engine. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering Periods 14-21) to capture this lower regime accurately while smoothing out the outlier at Period 21. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on all historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward starting around Period 14. Over the last 9 periods (P14-P22), the average demand is approximately 71 units, compared to the earlier regime of ~116. More recently, in the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged 55.75 units (57, 75, 36, 55). Given this deceleration, I will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this lower regime while maintaining enough buffer for the volatility seen in P17 (114 units) and P20 (75 units). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level of ~71 units from Period 14 onwards (P14-P22 avg), a decrease from the ~116 avg seen in P3-P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, demand spiked to 107, causing a stockout as on-hand was only 91 units. This spike contrasts with the recent trend (P14-P22 average ~71). Since lead time is 0 (confirmed by all 23 history periods), the system replenishes instantly. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 (covering periods 14-23) to capture the lower demand regime while incorporating the recent high-demand outlier (107) in the volatility estimation. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to handle recent fluctuations without over-reacting to a single spike. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 23 and 24) shows a sharp increase to ~107.5 units, significantly higher than the previous low-regime average of ~71 units observed since Period 14. This suggests a potential new demand regime shift or a temporary peak. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have faced stockouts in the last two periods (Period 23 demand 107 vs 91 sold; Period 24 demand 108 vs 96 sold), I must increase the base stock. I will use the last 11 periods (P14-P24) for the demand mean to capture the broader low-regime baseline while acknowledging the recent spikes, but I will rely on 'default' or a wider window for sigma to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since the OR engine calculates base stock as base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat, and we have zero on-hand, the order will target this new requirement. However, to be more responsive to the immediate jump without being overly influenced by just 2 data points, I'll set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P20-P24) to capture the accelerating trend (avg ~76.4) and sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect the higher uncertainty seen throughout the latter half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand surged from an average of ~71 (P14-P22) to ~107.5 (P23-P24), a ~51% increase, causing consecutive stockouts. Monitoring for sustained high-level demand.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand dropped to 59 units after two consecutive periods of high demand (~107.5 average) which resulted in stockouts. The carry-over insight from P25 noted a surge, but P25 itself shows demand returning towards the recent mean (P14-P22 average was ~71). Current on-hand is 39 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility observed recently (shifts from 108 to 59), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher activity (avg 91.3 over P23-P25) while remaining responsive to the shift. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for this increased volatility (standard deviation of [107, 108, 59] is ~28). This approach balances the need to recover from stockouts while being wary of the sudden drop in P25.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Following a lower demand period (avg ~71), a new higher-demand regime emerged starting at Period 23. In the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has been 107, 108, 59, and 101, averaging 93.75 units. Period 25's lower demand (59) is currently seen as volatility within this higher regime rather than a new shift, as Period 26 returned to 101. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this latest higher-demand regime efficiently, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents the stockouts witnessed in Periods 23 and 24. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: average demand increased from ~71 (P14-P22) to ~94 (P23-P26), an increase of ~32%.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards starting from Period 23. While the previous regime (P14-P22) averaged ~71 units, the current regime (P23-P27) is averaging 97.4 units (samples: 107, 108, 59, 101, 112). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with arrivals concluding in the same period they are ordered. Given the stockouts in P23 and P24 and the low ending inventory of 2 units in P27, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent higher demand level while maintaining responsiveness to volatility. The target service level (q) is approximately 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which the OR backend will calculate based on profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 23. Analyzing the demand from P23 to P28, the values are 107, 108, 59, 101, 112, 107. The average for this most recent regime is approximately 99 units per period. The lead time remains zero, as evidenced by every order since Period 1 concluding in the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is low (9 units), necessitating an order that reflects this higher stable mean and guards against recent volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the characteristics of this current demand regime (P23-P28).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at a higher level from Period 23-28, with mean demand ~99 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the demand spiked to 142, which is significantly higher than the average of ~99 observed between P23-P28. This resulted in a stockout (sold 116, available 116). This suggests either a new upward regime shift or high volatility. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable but subject to periodic spikes. I will set a higher mu_hat to account for this recent surge and provide a safety buffer. I'm using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat (covering the period since the last major shift at P23) to capture the current higher-demand environment (approx 105 per period). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand surge observed in P29 (142 units) following a stable period (avg ~99), leading to a stockout. Monitoring if this initiates a higher demand regime (>110/period) or is an outlier spike.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the demand surge observed in P29 (142 units) and P30 (136 units), the product has experienced two consecutive stockouts despite ordering at or above the previously identified mean of ~99. These two data points suggest a significant demand regime shift starting at Period 29. The average demand for P29-P30 is 139 units, which is a 40% increase over the P23-P28 average. Lead time remains consistently at 0. To prevent further stockouts and capture the higher demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to weigh these recent high-demand periods heavily. This will recalibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat to the new higher levels (approx 139 units/period) while the OR backend maintains a high service level (q = 0.8) based on the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Demand surged from an average of ~99 (P23-P28) to ~139 (P29-P30), a ~40% increase. This has resulted in consecutive stockouts at Period 29 and Period 30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 29. While previous demand (P23-P28) averaged ~99 units, the last three periods (P29-P31) have recorded demand values of 142, 136, and 139 respectively, representing a ~40% increase. This sustained elevated demand has caused multiple stockouts. To capture this new regime and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus exclusively on this high-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Demand increased from ~99 (P23-P28) to ~139 (P29-P31), a ~40% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand spiked to 189 units, significantly higher than the previous high regime average of ~139 observed since Period 29. This has resulted in a stockout (selling 142 on a demand of 189). Looking at the trajectory: P29 (142), P30 (136), P31 (139), and now P32 (189). This latest jump suggests either a secondary surge within the existing regime or a shift to an even higher demand level (>150/period). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs, I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 calculation to focus on the 4-period window since the initial regime shift at P29 (N=4), which captures the growth trend more aggressively than the 32-period average. This period's \u03bc\u0302 will be set to (1+L) * mean(142, 136, 139, 189) and sigma will be calculated on the same window.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand surge in P32 (189 units) may indicate a further regime shift or significant volatility increase within the post-P29 high-demand phase (prev avg ~139).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, most recently entering a significantly higher demand phase starting at Period 29. The demand from P29 to P33 has been: 142, 136, 139, 189, and 163, averaging ~154 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (P23-P28 avg ~99). The last two periods (P32-P33) specifically show even higher volatility and mean (avg 176). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts (observed in P29, P30, and P32), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime since Period 29. Since volatility has also increased significantly, I am using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock level accounts for the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~99 (P23-P28) to ~154 (P29-P33), an increase of ~55%. Recent volatility is high, with demand reaching 189 in P32.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 29. While previous demand (P23-P28) averaged ~99 units, the most recent six periods (P29-P34) show a mean demand of approximately 148.5 units (142, 136, 139, 189, 163, 122). The volatility has also increased substantially, particularly with the P32 peak of 189 units. In the most recent period (P34), demand softened to 122, but the overall trend remains much higher than early-game levels. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 6 periods to capture this new high-demand, high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this significantly elevated demand profile (approx 150 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 stabilized at a high level: average demand for P29-P34 is ~149 units, a ~50% increase from the P23-P28 average of ~99 units. Recent demand shows increased volatility (STD ~23.5 in recent regime).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 29, increasing from an average of ~99 units (P23-P28) to approximately 144 units (P29-P35). Although the most recent two periods (P34 and P35) show lower demand (122 and 112) compared to the peak in P32 (189), the overall regime is still significantly higher and more volatile (STD ~25 in the current regime) than previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high demand and recent volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 (covering the period since the shift at P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and heightened variance, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level to prevent stockouts while reflecting the most current demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 stabilized: P29-P35 average demand is ~144 units, a ~45% increase from the P23-P28 average. Volatility remains high in this regime (current STD approx 25).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 29. While recent observations in Period 35 (112) and Period 36 (89) suggest a potential cooling or high volatility, the average demand for the current regime (P29-P36) is approximately 137 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), a high service level (approx 80%) is mathematically optimal. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the behavior of this high-demand regime specifically. Lead time is consistently 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so L will remain at default.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime P29-P36 average is 137 units, representing a 38% increase over the previous regime (P23-P28 avg 99). Recent periods P35-P36 show a downward trend (112, 89), but need more data to confirm if this is a new regime or just volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) entered a high-demand regime at Period 29 (P29-P37 average ~134 units, compared to P23-P28 average ~99). However, recent volatility is notable: after a peak of 189 in P32, demand has softened over the last three periods (112, 89, 110: average ~104). While this might suggest a return towards the previous regime (avg ~99), it is too early to definitively declare a downward shift. I will treat the period from P29 to P37 (N=9) as the current regime to capture the elevated mean while acknowledging the recent high volatility (STD ~29 in this window). The lead time remains consistent at 0. Profit=4, Holding=1 yields a critical ratio of 0.8, which justifies a conservative safety stock to prevent stockouts seen earlier in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has been characterized by high average demand (~135 units) and high volatility (STD ~28). Recent periods (P34-P38) show a slight cooling with demand samples of 122, 112, 89, 110, and 90, averaging 104.6 units. This is significantly lower than the peak surge (P29-P33 avg: 154) but still higher than the previous baseline (P23-P28 avg: 99). Given the volatility, I will use a balanced lookback (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current softening while respecting the overall high-demand regime established in P29. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) captures the high variance observed in this entire regime, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent stockouts while accounting for the lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P29-P38 has stabilized at a lower average compared to the initial surge; the mean for P34-P38 is approx 105 units, down from the P29-P33 avg of 154, but still higher than the pre-P29 avg of 99.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the surge that began in Period 29. While early periods of this surge (P29-P33) saw an average demand of ~154, the most recent six periods (P34-P39) have shown a lower and more stable mean of 104 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101). This suggests the initial peak has subsided into a plateau that is still slightly higher than the P23-P28 average of 99. Given the high stockout risk seen previously, I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this current stable level while maintaining enough sensitivity to the recent volatility (the range remains between 89 and 122). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' style replenishment. The OR backend will target a high service level (unit profit $4 vs holding cost $1) based on these updated parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 34-39, with mean demand decreasing to approximately 104 units, compared to the initial surge average of 154 (P29-P33).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has transitioned from a high-volatility peak (P29-P33 avg ~154) to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the mean demand has been approximately 104.4 units with significantly lower volatility compared to the initial surge. Using N=7 for recent demand statistics captures this stabilized state while moving away from the extreme outliers observed in earlier periods. The lead time remains consistently at 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent 7-period window (P34-P40) ensures the base stock reflects the current stable consumption rate (~104/period) rather than the historical peak or the much lower pre-P29 levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 34-40, with mean demand confirmed at approximately 104 units, distinct from both the P29-P33 surge (avg 154) and the P23-P28 baseline (avg 99).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the surge observed in Periods 29-33. From Period 34 to Period 41, the demand has averaged approximately 101.1 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107, 78), which is a significant reduction from the earlier peak (~154) but remains slightly above the pre-surge baseline of ~99. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliably observed (confirmed through Period 41 conclude). Since the current demand regime appears stable over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior and ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to match this stabilized level while accounting for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 34-41, with mean demand confirmed at approximately 101 units, down from the P29-P33 surge average of 154.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the initial surge between Periods 29-33. From Period 34 to Period 42, the average demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. This is a significant shift from the high-volatility surge period (which saw a peak of 189 units). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.8. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime, I am selecting recent_N where N=9 (covering the period from P34 to P42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This aligns the inventory policy with the most recent sustained demand pattern while ignoring the outlier-heavy surge period prior to P34. This approach ensures sufficient stock to meet the 80% service level without over-ordering based on historical peaks.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the high-volatility surge between Periods 29-33. From Period 34 to Period 43, the average demand is approximately 96 units, which is significantly lower than the previous regime's average (~154). Period 43 demand was particularly low at 49 units, but this follows a pattern of high variance in this product's demand history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 63 and a lead time of 0, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this most recent stable regime (Periods 34-43). This aligns the base stock level with the observed stabilized demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so the 'calculate' method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 34-43, with the mean demand confirmed at approximately 96 units (P34-P43 avg), maintaining a lower level than the P29-P33 surge.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to Period 44 is approximately 92.2 units, which is significantly lower than the peak surge seen between Periods 29-33 (avg ~153). Recent demand in Periods 43 (49 units) and 44 (58 units) suggests a potential further dipping or high volatility at this lower level. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently at 0. Given the current on-hand inventory of 55, I will continue to use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the Period 34-44 regime) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the historical high-demand surge from earlier periods, while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between Periods 34-44, with the mean demand confirmed at approximately 92 units (P34-P44 avg), maintaining a lower level than the P29-P33 surge and slightly lower than the P34-P43 average.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to Period 45 is approximately 92.5 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding surge (P29-P33 avg ~154) and slightly lower than the P23-P28 baseline (~99). Most recently, demand has fluctuated between 49 and 107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture the current regime's mean and volatility while being responsive to the slight downward trend seen in the last few periods (P43-P45 avg ~62), I am using a recent window of N=12 (P34-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire duration of the current 'post-surge' regime to ensure the OR engine balances the unit profit of $4 against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate base stock level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime starting around Period 34. The average demand from P34 to P46 is approximately 90.6 units (Calculated: sum(122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107, 78, 94, 49, 58, 79, 66) / 13). Specifically, the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) show an even lower average of 69.2 units, indicating a possible further softening or simply high volatility. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels given a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (implying an 80% service level target), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the prevailing volatility (std dev ~20.5 in this regime). This balances the long-term stabilization since P34 with the recent lower demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at a lower level from Period 34-46, with mean demand ~91 units per period, down from the P29-P33 surge level.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 34 at a lower level compared to the Period 29-33 surge. For the current decision (Period 48), the focus is on the most recent demand behavior to optimize inventory levels for the final periods of the game. Calculating the mean demand from Period 34 to 47 yields approximately 89.9 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight noting a stabilization around 91 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the current on-hand inventory of 34 units and the goal to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory costs for the final three periods, using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the stable regime from P34 onwards) is the most appropriate approach to capture the current mean and variance. This ensures the service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) is met without overstacking as we approach the end of the simulation.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 43. Analyzing the most recent data (P43-P48), the mean demand is approximately 67 units with a standard deviation of 11. Specifically, the demand values are 49, 58, 79, 66, 74, 76. This is consistent with the 'Period 47' carry-over insight which noted a stable regime around 91 units, but recent trends suggest a further slight decline or stabilization towards the lower 70s. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a 0.8 service level (calculated from profit $4 and holding cost $1), I will use the last 6 periods (P43-P48) to capture this most recent stable behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand environment more accurately than the longer-term average which includes the post-P29 surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further from Period 43-48: average demand is ~67 units, down from the ~91 units observed in Period 34-46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, demand spiked to 114 units, significantly higher than the previous 6-period average of ~67 units. This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests either a potential regime shift upwards or a high-volatility event. Given the carry-over history shows frequent shifts and spikes for this SKU, I will adjust mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=7) to capture the recent mean (approx 78) while accounting for the Period 49 spike (114). The promised lead time remains 0 and consistent with historical observations. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-day lead time. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) helps the OR engine account for the recent increase in volatility without over-reacting to the single outlier spike of 114.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand surge at Period 49 (114 units) following a low-demand period (~67 avg), leading to a stockout. Monitoring for a potential return to previous high-demand (~90+) regimes.
