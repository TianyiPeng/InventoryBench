The average demand across these samples is approximately 158 units per period.

To maximize profit while accounting for potential demand spikes (like the 211 seen in Period 3) and avoiding excessive holding costs, I will target an inventory position that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety margin. Given the average (158) and the high (211), I will order 180 units to balance the risk of stockouts against the $1.0 holding cost.",
