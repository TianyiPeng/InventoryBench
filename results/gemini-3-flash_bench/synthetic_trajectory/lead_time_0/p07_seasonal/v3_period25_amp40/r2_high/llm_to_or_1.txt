Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no history or concluding message to evaluate. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [118, 153, 211, 153, 155], giving an average of 158. Period 1 demand was 118. Given the lead time is 0, the order arrives within the period. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all 5 historical samples provided in the prompt to set the initial order level. The OR backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std. Pipeline inventory is currently 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the item 'chips(Regular)' exhibited a lead time of 0 periods (ordered 213, arrived 213 in the same period), confirming the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 138, which aligns relatively well with the provided historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155). There is currently no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality, as we have only one period of live data and the product (regular chips) is generally a stable staple. The current on-hand inventory is 75. Given a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (incorporating the most recent historical samples and Period 1) to stabilize the forecast while acknowledging the slightly lower demand observed in Period 1 compared to the overall historical average.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for the first two periods was 138 and 121 (mean: 129.5). Historical data provided (periods 1-5) suggests a mean of 158, but we only have realized demand for periods 1 and 2. The sample set is small (N=5 total), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the provided pre-game data and the current realized demand. Since L=0 has been consistent, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the observed lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2048.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 138, Period 2 was 121, and Period 3 was 113. The provided historical data in the prompt (Period_1: 118, Period_2: 153, Period_3: 211, Period_4: 153, Period_5: 155) appears to represent a different sample set or prior. Based on the actual 'Game History' observations, the average demand is 124 units. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals have occurred within the same period (L=0 confirmed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Since the demand shows slight variation but no clear sustained regime shift yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the active game history for the mean and standard deviation. Setting L=0 explicitly matches observed performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1334.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (118, 153, 211, 153, 155 - as provided in the sample data; Note: the 'conclude' messages show actual demand of 138, 121, 113, 74 which suggests a slight downward trend or stabilization from a higher initial period). The mean demand over the 4 concluded periods is approximately 111.5 with a standard deviation of about 26.7. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the optimal service level is 0.95. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most relevant demand statistics and set L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the 0-period lead time performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2683.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) following a demand spike in Period 5 (142 units). Historical demand across Period 1-5 shows high variability (118, 153, 211, 153, 155 in seed data; 138, 121, 113, 74, 142 in actuals), with a recent mean of approximately 118. Comparison of the last 5 actual periods shows a drop in Period 4 followed by a sharp recovery in Period 5. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-5 occurring in the same period they were ordered. To prevent a stockout in Period 6, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent volatility while maintaining sufficient inventory. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is currently stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2977.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 7, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Demand across the first 6 periods has shown some variability (avg ~124), but the most recent two periods (P5 and P6) show a noticeable upward trend (142 and 157 respectively) compared to P4 (74). Given that Profit ($19) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand trend (P4-P6 average: 124.3, but heavily weighted by the recent jump) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L remains 'default' since the promised lead time of 0 aligns with historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2442.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all recorded orders (P1-P7). The demand for chips(Regular) shows some volatility but remains within a consistent range. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Historical demand across the 7 concluded periods has a mean of approximately 125.6 units and a standard deviation of 27.2. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 123.8) and sigma_hat (std 30.6) captures the more recent demand variability since Period 3. With a lead time of 0, the stock-up level needs to cover demand for the current period including the variability to maintain high service levels (profit=19, holding=1, critical ratio=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods (P1 to P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3363.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (sold 177 despite demand of 184) because the ending on-hand inventory hit 0. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 8 previous periods. Demand has shown some volatility recently (Period 8 demand was 184, significantly higher than the initial average). While the seeded historical data suggested a mean around 158, the observed demand (P1-P8) average is roughly 133. However, with the stockout in P8 and the higher demand in P5 (142), P6 (157), and P8 (184), there's a slight upward trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility and average (approx 138/period) to recover from the stockout while remaining sensitive to recent demand levels. L=0 is maintained as per the consistent observations.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred Period 8: demand (184) exceeded available supply (177). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2575.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time remained 0 (205 units ordered and arrived in the same period). The stockout in Period 8 was caused by demand (184) exceeding the starting on-hand (177); however, the system now has 66 units on-hand. Looking at historical arrivals from Period 1 to Period 9, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand patterns show significant variability, with a recent peak in Period 8 (184) and a drop in Period 9 (139). To account for recent volatility and avoid further stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a 5-period window for demand mean and variance (Periods 5-9: 142, 157, 132, 184, 139). This provides a more responsive estimate (mean ~151) compared to the all-time average while covering the observed 1-period demand spike risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1515.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, with a stockout in Period 8 (demand 184) followed by a sharp drop in Period 10 (demand 85). Throughout all 10 periods, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To account for the high variance and recent fluctuations while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to encompass the full observed range of the current pattern. This ensures the OR backend captures the mean of ~128 and the standard deviation derived from the actual game history, protecting against future spikes similar to Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2098.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 68 units with no items in transit. Historical demand since Period 1 has shown some volatility, ranging from 74 to 184 units, but appears to be stable around a mean of approximately 127 units. The Lead Time has consistently remained at 0 periods across all 11 concluded periods, confirming that orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To capture the most recent demand behavior and adjust for the stockout that occurred in Period 8, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (Periods 5-11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This period covers both high demand (184) and more moderate recent demand (85, 114), providing a balanced forecast and safety stock. With L=0, the backend will target a base stock level to cover Period 12's demand.

=== Period 12 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1912.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (all 12 past orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand has been somewhat volatile but stable in terms of its mean. The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 125.4. Recent demand in Periods 10-12 (85, 114, 105) shows a slight dip compared to the peak in Period 8 (184). Using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility calculations (Periods 8-12: 184, 139, 85, 114, 105) provides a mean of 125.4, which is consistent with the overall historical average (130.6 including seed data). This captures the recent stockout event and subsequent stabilization. The lead time is set to 0. Since profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level is maintained by the OR backend naturally.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1671.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend over the last four periods (Period 10-13: 85, 114, 105, 93). The mean demand for these last 4 periods is approximately 99, compared to the overall historical mean of 122. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all history up to Period 13. Given the current on-hand inventory of 96, and the shift towards lower demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This will adjust the base stock to a more appropriate level, preventing over-ordering and minimizing holding costs while still maintaining a high service level (calculated internally by the OR backend at approximately 95% based on profit vs. holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: average demand decreased from ~130 to ~99 (-24%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1359.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, the actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand has shown a clear downward shift starting from Period 10. The average demand for Periods 1-9 was approximately 144.3 units, whereas the average demand for Periods 10-14 has dropped to 94.2 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74). To prevent overstocking given this sustained lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture only the current regime's characteristics. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~94 units/period demand level rather than the previous higher levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1719.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 93.8 units, significantly lower than the initial periods. Lead time is consistently 0 (arriving within the same period), and there are no missing or delayed shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is quite low (29 units). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established lower-demand regime while maintaining a tight buffer. The L parameter remains 'default' (0) as evidenced by the consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' in historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: Period 10-15 average is 93.8 units, compared to early period average of ~130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first identified in Period 14 has remained stable. For the last 7 periods (P10-P16), the demand average is approximately 91.8. This is a significant drop from the early period average (P1-P9) of ~133. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a 7-period window aligns with the current stable regime and prevents data from the previous high-demand period (P1-P9) from inflating the base stock and causing excess holding costs. The target service level should remain high given the strong profit-to-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P10-P16 average demand is 91.8 units, compared to initial P1-P9 average of 133.5.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime starting from Period 10. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 91 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81), which is significantly lower than the initial average of ~133. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by 17 consecutive periods of same-day arrivals. I will set the lead time parameter to 'calculate' to reflect this observed zero-day lead time. I will center mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this new stable, lower-demand regime while maintaining appropriate safety stock levels to avoid the stockout seen in Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1567.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 10. For Period 19, the most recent demand samples (P10-P18) show a stable lower mean. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the average demand is approximately 89.8 units (85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80, 81, 84). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. Therefore, I will set L to 0 (default/promised) and use recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1=1) while considering the updated volatility and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $649.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 10. Comparing the first 9 periods (average ~133.8) to the subsequent 10 periods (P10-P19 average ~84.6), the signal is clear. However, Period 19 showed a significant drop to 38 units, which might be an outlier or the start of a further decline. To be responsive but stable, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the entire lower regime while including the recent low data point. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history (P1 to P19), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize this observed consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 10-19 average is 84.6 units, significantly lower than the Period 1-9 average of 133.8. Low outlier observed in Period 19 (38 units).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 10. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 10-20) is approximately 84.4 units per period, a significant decrease from the earlier average of ~134. Period 19 was a low outlier (38), but Period 20 returned to the new normal (82). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established lower demand regime while smoothing out the Period 19 outlier. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock level appropriate for the current lower-demand environment, minimizing holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target quantile \u2248 0.95).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 21 is approximately 84.5 units, with a noticeable outlier in Period 19 (38 units). Comparing the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21), the mean is 72.2 units, but this is heavily influenced by the P19 outlier; the mean of P10-P21 (excluding the outlier) is about 88 units. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime (P10 to P21) while smoothing the outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=12 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods since the start, so I will continue to use the calculate method which will reflect this history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1205.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 10 is well-documented and sustained. Since Period 10 (13 periods ago), the average demand has dropped to approximately 82.3 units from the initial average of ~133. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history (P1-P22), confirming that orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime, I am using recent_N = 13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the mean and volatility since the shift. This provides a balance between the stable lower demand seen recently (P20-P22: 82, 76, 66) and the volatility within this regime (including the P19 outlier of 38 and P11 high of 114). The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that targets a 0.95 service level, aligned with the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10 to 22 confirmed: average 82.3 units (down from ~133 initial), with stable 0-period lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 23 is approximately 81.1 units, significantly lower than the initial average of ~134. Recent periods (P21-P23) show even lower demand (76, 66, 55). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a high service level (dictated by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14, covering the entire duration of the lower demand regime to capture a stable mean and variance for this period. Lead time will be set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10 to 23 has stabilized at a lower mean of 81.1 units (standard deviation ~19.5), significantly lower than the Period 1-9 average of 133.8.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25. Historical data shows two distinct demand regimes for 'chips(Regular)': an initial high-demand phase (P1-P9 mean ~133.8) and a subsequent lower-demand stability phase starting around Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 24 is approximately 80.8 units (standard deviation ~19.1). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is available for sale in the same period it is placed). In Period 24, we saw a demand of 107 units, which depleted on-hand inventory to 5. Since demand has stabilized since Period 10, I am using N=15 for recent_N to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the earlier high-demand period. Lead time L=0 is maintained as observed in all 24 completed periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P10-P24 stabilized with a mean of ~80.8 and std dev of ~19.1. Previous high-demand regime (P1-P9) is no longer relevant for short-term forecasting.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 10, dropping from an initial average of ~134 to a lower, stable regime. Over the most recent 16 periods (P10-P25), the mean demand is 82.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. Period 25 demand was 89, consistent with this lower regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting a high service level is optimal. I will use a window of N=16 (the length of the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculate method for lead time as it has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2185.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system experienced a stockout (demand 139, sold 115) because the order was sized based on the lower demand regime (mean ~80). This demand of 139 matches the levels seen in the initial high-demand regime (P1-P9 mean ~133). This indicates a possible shift back to higher demand or a period of high volatility. I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly to capture this upward shift, using 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering P10-P26) as a baseline but recognizing we need to buffer for the 139 observed demand. Given the stockout and the return of high demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma to capture the increased volatility (38 to 139 range). Calculating L=0 is confirmed by continuous history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 26: demand spiked to 139 units, ending the low-demand regime (avg ~80) observed from P10-P25. This signal matches early-game levels (~133).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, a significant demand spike (139 units) was observed, ending a long lower-demand regime (avg ~81) that had persisted since Period 10. The Period 27 demand (105 units) remains higher than the previous low-regime average, suggesting a shift back toward the higher levels seen in the early game (P1-P9 mean ~134). Because this shift is recent (only 2 periods of evidence for the new level), I am using a hybrid approach: I've chosen 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend (P25-P27: 89, 139, 105; mean=111), but I am explicitly setting sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std dev) observed during the transition and previous high-demand regime to prevent stockouts like the one in P26. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Starting P26, demand has increased (P26-P27 average 122 units) from the P10-P25 average (~81), signalling a return toward higher early-game levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2879.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime starting at Period 26, matching the early-game average (~133 units/period). Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) was 139, 105, and 152, resulting in a three-period average of 132 units. This confirms the break from the low-demand regime (avg ~81) seen between Periods 10-25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (since the shift) to capture this higher mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current upward trend while maintaining a High Service Level (19/20 or 95%) given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: 3-period average increased to 132 units from the previous average of ~81 units (+63%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3148.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 26. After a long period (P10-P25) of lower demand (averaging ~81), the last four periods (P26-P29) show a sharp increase with demands of 139, 105, 152, and 166 (average ~140.5). This confirms the 'carry-over insight' that demand has returned to, and potentially exceeded, initial early-game levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent spike and ensure high service levels (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new high-demand regime. This will prevent stockouts like those seen in Period 26 and Period 29 (where inventory ended very low).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Period 26-29 average demand is 140.5 units, a 73% increase from the Period 10-25 average (~81). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2116.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 26. Looking at the most recent data (Periods 26 to 30), the average demand is approximately 135.4 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~81 units observed between Periods 10-25. Period 30 saw 115 units of demand, continuing this trend. My goal is to capture this high-demand shift using recent data while maintaining enough of a buffer for volatility, as seen in Period 29 (166 units). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P26-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the irrelevant low-demand history and focus on the current high-demand cycle. This ensures we carry enough inventory to meet shifts similar to early-game levels without overstacking against the lower middle-game mean.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand is 135.4 units, representing a sustained return to early-game demand levels (initial P1-P9 average was ~133).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-demand regime starting around Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is approximately 133.3 units, which is consistent with the early-game levels (P1-P9 avg ~133). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed over the entire history and specifically noted in the conclude messages up to Period 31. To respond to this stable high-demand regime, I am using recent_N with N=6 (covering the shift from Period 26 to 31) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the increased mean and the relevant volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 0 (promised lead time) is appropriate as arrivals are same-period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, returning to a high-demand state. From Period 26 to Period 32, the average demand is 133.0 units (139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131), which is almost identical to the initial Period 1-9 average of 133.8. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire game. For Period 33, I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime metrics, as this covers the exact duration of the new regime starting at P26. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend's inventory target (base stock) will naturally skew higher to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase while the lead time remains 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high-demand regime that began at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 132.75 units (Period 26-33), which aligns with the initial Period 1-9 average of ~133. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods throughout the entire game. Currently, we have 37 units on-hand. Given that arrivals occur in the same period as the order (L=0), the target base stock must cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1 period). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from P26 to P33) to capture this stabilized higher demand level. The OR engine will use the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0) to maintain a high service level, which is appropriate for this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P26-P33) remains stable with a mean of ~133 units and a 0-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to remain in a high-demand regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 34, the average demand is approximately 129.6 units per period, which is a significant shift from the previous low-regime average of ~81 units. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 104 units, following a string of higher values (131, 131, 123, 115, 166, 152, 105, 139). This suggests the high-demand state is stable. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by continuous arrival data (last confirmed in Period 34 conclude). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (Period 26-34) to capture this regime accurately. Lead time (L) is set to 0 (default). Setting parameters based on this recent high-demand window allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety factor derived from the recent volatility (std dev of the last 9 periods is ~20 units), ensuring high service level during this period of elevated demand.

The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 through P35 arriving in the same period it was placed. For Period 36, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand period (P10-P25). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current volatility and mean demand, maintaining high service levels (approx 95% target given the high profit/cost ratio) for the current 15 units on-hand.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for chips(Regular) began at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 36. The average demand during this 11-period interval (P26-P36) is approximately 130.4 units, which aligns closely with the early-game average (~133). Recent observations (P34-P36) show values of 104, 149, and 114, indicating continued volatility around this mean. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history (last observed order P36 arrived in P36). Therefore, I will set L to 0 (default) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the properties of this stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a 'high' state that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 127.3 units (calculated from P26 to P37). The most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) show demands of 131, 104, 149, 114, and 90, averaging 117.6 units. While the last two periods show a slight softening, the overall regime remains significantly higher than the P10-P25 average (~81). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history (confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full scope of this current demand regime (P26-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it best reflects the current environment. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period observations.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26, matching the levels seen in the earliest periods of the game. For the last 13 periods (P26-P38), the average demand is approximately 125.8 units with a standard deviation of about 22.4 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be realized consistently (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). In the most recent period (P38), demand was 117 units. Based on this established stability at the higher regime, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture this entire current regime's behavior. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the 120-130 unit/period expectation while maintaining a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26, matching early-game levels. Over the last 14 periods (P26-P39), the average demand is 125 units, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (~81 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every order from P1 through P39. Given the stable high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N of 14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while excluding the irrelevant low-demand period (P10-P25). Setting L to calculate relies on the historical average lead time, which is 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted into a high-demand regime starting at Period 26, significantly increasing from the lower average (~81) observed between Periods 10-25. Since Period 31, demand has stabilized at levels consistent with the early game (P26-P40 average is approximately 120 units). However, a recent slight downward trend is visible (P37-P40 demands: 90, 117, 111, 70), indicating it might be settling closer to a mean of 110-120 rather than 140. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous arrivals in the sequence. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (P26-P40) while excluding the previous low-demand period. Lead time (L) is set to default (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $998.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a softening trend over the last 5-6 periods. While the regime starting at Period 26 averaged ~133 units, the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) have averaged 89.2 units (90, 117, 111, 70, 58), with the last two periods particularly low. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be cooling, I will shift the lookback window (N) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to the last 7 periods (P35-P41, average ~100.4), which captures the transition from high demand to the current lower trend. This N=7 provides enough sensitivity to the recent slowdown without reacting too drastically to the single lowest data point (58). Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed starting Period 37: average demand for P37-P41 decreased to 89.2 units compared to the P26-P36 average of ~132 units (-32%).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower regime. Since Period 37, demand has softened significantly, with an average of 89.2 units over P37-P42, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~132 units (P26-P36). This matches a recurring pattern in the game history where demand shifts between high (~130) and low (~85) levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adjust to this lower demand while maintaining a high service level (given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering the period from P37 to P42) to capture this latest stable regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been perfectly stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 37: average demand (P37-P42) is 89.2 units, down from ~132 units in the P26-P36 period (-32%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1133.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another regime shift. From Period 37 onwards, demand has softened significantly compared to the high-demand period (P26-P36). The average demand for the last seven periods (P37-P43) is 85.4 units (90, 117, 111, 70, 58, 89, 63), which is a clear decrease from the previous average of ~132. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for every period in the game history. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders appropriately for the current environment, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1). Using N=7 covers the entire recognized 'softened' regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P37-P43): Average demand has settled at 85.4 units, representing a 35% decrease from the P26-P36 high-demand regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 44 is approximately 81.6 units per period, which is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~132). The most recent three periods (P42-P44) show demand levels of 89, 63, and 55. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime (P37-P44) while excluding the previous high-demand peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current lower consumption rate, minimizing unnecessary holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P37-P44): Recent 8-period mean is ~81.6 units, reflecting a ~38% decrease from the P26-P36 high-demand average (~132).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a lower regime starting from Period 37. The last 9 periods (P37-P45) show a mean of approximately 76.7 units, significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~132 units. The most recent demand (P45) was 37, continuing a downward trend or high volatility within this lower bracket. Using a recent_N window of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this stabilized lower demand regime and its associated volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. By setting N=9, the OR backend will calculate the base stock using the mean and standard deviation of the current regime (P37-P45), balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost with a high service level appropriate for the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P37-P45): Recent 9-period mean is ~76.7 units, reflecting a ~42% decrease from the P26-P36 high-demand average (~132).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1439.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a stabilized lower-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 46 (the last 10 periods) is approximately 76.8 units, which is a significant reduction from the high-demand phase seen in Periods 26-36 (avg ~132). This lower level is consistent with the earlier regime observed between Periods 10-25. The lead time remains perfectly stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. To optimize for the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (approx. 95th percentile). I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistical characteristics of this current persistent low-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant high-demand history.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=76, arrived=76 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=119, demand=83, sold=83, ending on-hand inventory=36
Daily Profit: $1577.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower-demand state that began around Period 37. For the most recent 11 periods (P37-P47), the average demand is approximately 77.4 units. Period 47 demand was 83, which is consistent with this lower regime. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game history. I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this current regime's mean and standard deviation accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current ~77 unit demand rather than the previous ~132 unit high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P37-P47): Recent 11-period mean is ~77.4 units, maintaining the ~41% decrease from the P26-P36 high-demand average (~132).

Daily Reward (R_t): $743.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand for the last 12 periods (P37-P48) is approximately 74.5 units, which is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand phase (P26-P36) where the average was ~132 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time to satisfy the current period's demand. Given the stockout risk seen in higher demand periods and the relatively low holding cost ($1) compared to profit ($19), a slightly conservative approach using the last 12 periods (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the variance of this current regime while avoiding overstocking based on old, high-demand data. This ensures the OR backend captures the current mean of ~75 and the associated volatility to maintain the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P37-P48): Recent 12-period mean is ~74.5 units, maintaining the significant decrease (~43%) from the P26-P36 high-demand average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1984.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a lower-demand regime that started around Period 37. The average demand for the most recent 13 periods (P37-P49) is approximately 76.8 units, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~132 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods across the entire history. For Period 50, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this stabilized lower regime (P37-P49). On-hand inventory is very low at 11 units, so the OR backend should trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock requirements for the current period.
