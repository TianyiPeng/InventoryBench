Historical data for the first five periods (Period_1 to Period_5) shows demand values of 118, 153, 211, 153, and 155, resulting in an average of approximately 158 units per period. The product is a staple snack (Regular chips), which typically exhibits steady demand with occasional spikes. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand in this same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to place an order immediately to cover Period 1 demand. Given the average and recent volatility, I will target a slightly higher-than-average amount (165 units) to provide a small buffer against stockouts while minimizing holding costs, as I can reorder next period with 0 lead time.",
