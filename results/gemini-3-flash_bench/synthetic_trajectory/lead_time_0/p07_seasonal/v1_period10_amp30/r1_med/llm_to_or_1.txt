Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. We have 5 demand samples available (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) with a mean of 108.8 and a standard deviation of 33.9. The promised lead time is 0 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to place an order to meet customer demand that occurs later this period. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 0), and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the mean and variance from the available historical data points.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 114 units, which is significantly higher than the initial sample of 76 (Period_1 in data context). However, looking at the historical samples provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78), the average is approximately 108.8. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods in Period 1 (ordered and arrived same day). Our current on-hand inventory is 25. With a 0-period lead time, we need to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period (Period 2). Given the variability in the historical data (range 76-159), I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 0) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations. Since we only have 5 historical samples plus 1 observed period, I'll set N=5 to balance recent trends with the available data history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand has been consistently higher than the initial historical data samples (averaging 114 units in P1 and P2 vs a historical average of approx 109 units, with a peak of 159 in historical P3). Given that today is Period 3 and historical Period 3 had the highest demand (159), I will use a conservative forecast that accounts for this potential peak. I'll set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg 114) but adjust for the (1+L) factor in the OR backend. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively targets 1 period of demand. I'll use default sigma_hat to capture the full historical volatility, encompassing the spike seen in historical P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm that actual lead time is indeed 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around an average of 104.5 units (P1: 114, P2: 114, P3: 86). Note that the historical demand data provided in the prompt (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) actually differs from the 'conclude' messages in the history (114, 114, 86). I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it represents the actual realized demand in the game environment. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns while acknowledging the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $471.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe demand history for 5 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (range 76 to 159). The last four concluded periods show an average demand of approximately 108 units. Period 4 concluded with only 1 unit on hand, indicating we are at risk of stockouts if demand spikes. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent history of this SKU, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the observed volatility (\u03c3\u0302) while centering on the mean demand (\u03bc\u0302). Setting L to 0 via the 'calculate' method is appropriate given the consistent 0-period lead time observed in all 4 concluded periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, there was a stockout (121 demand vs 118 starting inventory), resulting in 3 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Analysis of the demand history (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 from description, and 114, 114, 86, 118, 121 from history) suggests a shift. The initial samples provided in the prompt were lower, but the actual realized demand over the last 5 periods has stabilized around a mean of 110.6 units with significant volatility. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to assume. Given the recent stockout and the upward trend in demand compared to the earliest samples, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand regime and ensure enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand was 75 units, allowing on-hand inventory to recover to 48 units. Historical demand across the 6 completed periods (114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75) averages 104.7 units per period. The inferred lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is visible in the same period's conclusion). Since there's no strong seasonal calendar data or sustained regime shift evident (demand fluctuates between 75 and 121), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the full recent history's mean and variance. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 104.7 average demand plus a safety buffer for the next period (L+1=1), accounting for the relatively high holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-7 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but no clear trend; the mean demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 100.28 units. Recent demand (Periods 6 and 7) has dropped slightly below this average (75 and 74 units). To capture the recent variability while maintaining a buffer against stockouts (as seen in Period 5), I am using a recent window of N=5 to calculate the demand parameters. This allows the model to adjust to the lower demand seen in the last two periods while still accounting for the higher demand seen in periods 4 and 5. L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. In Period 8, we stocked out (ending inventory=0) because demand (119) exceeded starting inventory (115), despite the order arriving the same day. Observed demand for Period 1-8 averages ~102.6 units (samples: 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119). There is no clear seasonal trend yet, but demand is volatile (std dev ~20). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in all 8 periods. To prevent stockouts and satisfy the high target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history of the SKU. L is set to 'calculate' as the history confirms L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility, with a mean demand over the last 9 periods of approximately 102.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering periods 5-9) to capture the more recent demand environment which averages 98.2 units per period (higher than the early periods). This helps balance the stock for the 1-period coverage (L+1). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the overall historical variance since the start of the game to ensure adequate safety stock during demand spikes, as we have already faced stockouts in periods 5 and 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 8 and Period 10. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 0, which has been consistently met (all orders P1-P10 arrived same-period). Demand has been volatile: P1-P10 demand samples are [114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119, 102, 140], with a mean of 106.3 and a standard deviation of 21.6. Significant demand spikes were observed in P5 (121), P8 (119), and P10 (140), leading to stockouts. To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand trend (Avg = 111.2) and use a slightly wider sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples to account for the increasing volatility. L remains default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, with recent values ranging from 78 to 140. Looking at the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand was [74, 119, 102, 140, 78], averaging 102.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 28. Observed lead time is consistently 0 (arrived in same period). The stockouts in P5, P8, and P10 indicate that demand frequently exceeds available inventory when the target is set too low. High profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies an 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture current environmental noise while ensuring we cover the high-demand spikes (like 140) that can lead to lost sales.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility and several instances of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 in Periods 5, 8, 10, and 12). Period 12 saw a significant demand spike to 158 units, the highest in the history provided, suggesting current inventory levels are insufficient. However, the overall demand pattern since Period 1 remains relatively stable in mean (approx 108 units) but with high variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the high variance and the recent extreme demand in Period 12, I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current demand density (averaging ~112 per period) and a wider window (N=12) for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility seen across the game, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts in high-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift. Over periods 1-9, demand averaged 104 units. However, in periods 10-13, demand increased to 140, 78, 158, and 150 respectively (average 131.5). The last two periods (12 and 13) specifically showed very high demand (158 and 150), leading to stockouts despite ordering for what appeared to be aggressive base stocks. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the review cycle. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this higher mean demand (131.5 per period) while maintaining a higher sigma to protect against the volatility observed in this recent window. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts (sold < demand in 3 of the last 4 periods) by lifting the base stock level to reflect the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: average demand increased from ~104 to ~131.5 units (+26%). Recent periods (P12-P13) specifically show peak demand near 150-160 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 130.0 units, compared to the initial periods. Recent demand shows significant volatility with peaks reaching 150-158 units. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent same-period arrivals (L=0) have been confirmed throughout history. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (P10, P12, P13), I need to use the recent higher demand mean to calculate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher demand level and its increased variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 130+ unit demand expected during Period 15. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80%, which the backend will calculate using these parameters.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all history (P1-P15). A demand regime shift was previously identified starting at Period 10. Since Period 10, the demand has been consistently higher and more volatile, with an average of approximately 124.8 units compared to the earlier average of ~102.5. Recent periods (P14 and P15) show demand returning from extreme peaks (158, 150) to more moderate levels (124, 99), but still within the higher-variance regime. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior (Periods 10-15) while filtering out the lower demand from the initial weeks. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current average plus a safety buffer for the high observed volatility, maximizing profit while minimizing stockouts seen in P8, P10, P12, and P13.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10, but very recent periods (P15 and P16) have shown a cooling trend with demand dropping to 99 and 58 units respectively. However, given the profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, warranting a relatively high service level. Current on-hand inventory is 93 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to the single low demand point in P16 (58 units) while acknowledging the recent trend, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average (which includes the high demand in P12-P13 and the low demand in P16). This balances the high and low extremes seen in the last week. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this higher-demand regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a higher regime than at the start of the game. Since Period 10, the daily demand average has shifted from ~104 to ~114 (calculated across P10-P17). While there was a slight lull in Periods 16-17 (58 and 103 units), the variability remains high (std dev is significant), and the product previously saw peaks up to 158 units. To ensure high service levels while accounting for the recent regime, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean and standard deviation since the regime shift at Period 10. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages in history, so I am using the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this baseline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified in Period 14. Average demand since Period 10 is approximately 111.1 units, with significant volatility (peaks up to 158 and lows down to 46 in the most recent period). Specifically, the last 9 periods (P10-P18) show a mean of 111.1, compared to the earlier baseline. However, looking at the very recent data, demand has cooled significantly in the last three periods (103, 46, and current on-hand suggest lower recent velocity). To balance the higher recent peak potential with the current inventory of 98, I will use a recent_N window for both mean and sigma to capture the increased variance seen in this higher-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown more volatility since Period 10, but recent periods (P16-P19) suggest a stabilization toward a lower mean compared to the P12-P13 peaks. Specifically, demand in the last 10 periods (P10-P19) averaged 105.7, which is very similar to the initial P1-P9 average of 103.5. While P10-P14 saw high demand (avg 130), the most recent four periods (P16-P19) averaged only 77. This suggests the high-demand regime may have ended. I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the mean has returned to historical levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 39, and with zero lead time, the order placed will meet the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 proved to be a temporary spike; demand has returned to an average of ~77 over the last 4 periods (P16-P19), suggesting a return to or even a dip below the historical mean of 104.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. After a high-demand period (P10-P14), demand has cooled off considerably. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand values were 58, 103, 46, 101, and 69, resulting in an average of 75.4. This is much lower than the previous regime (~131) and also lower than the original long-term average (~104). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation remains high), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower-demand state. The on-hand inventory is 69, which is close to the recent average demand, so the OR engine will likely place a moderate order to reach the new base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 20: Average demand for P16-P20 is ~75 units, a significant decrease from the P10-P14 peak (~131) and below the initial historical mean (~104).

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern shows a stabilization at a lower level compared to the mid-game spike. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged approximately 81 units (58, 103, 46, 101, 69, 109). This is significantly lower than the P10-P14 peak (~131) and slightly lower than the initial historical mean (~104). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, so a full replacement order is needed to meet Period 22 demand. I will use a recent_N window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower consumption regime while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation remains relatively high despite lower mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 16: average demand for P16-P21 is approximately 81 units, confirming a significant drop from the P10-P14 peak and a shift below the long-term historical mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, we are experiencing a significant demand uptick that contradicts the recent low-regime trend noted in the carry-over insights. Demand in Period 21 (109 units) and Period 22 (136 units) suggests a return to the higher mean levels seen around Period 10-14, or at least a recovery from the sub-80 average seen in P16-P20. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, meaning we are stocked out and must place a substantial order to cover Period 23's demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent demand increase using recent_N (N=7) to capture the transition from the low period into the current surge (P16-P22 avg ~89, but weighted towards the recent spikes). I will set sigma_hat using the same window to reflect increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: The previous low-demand period (P16-P20, avg ~75) has ended; P21-P22 show a sharp return to high demand (avg 122.5), suggesting a new volatile high-demand regime or a cyclical return to P10 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift back to a higher demand regime. For the last three periods (P21, P22, P23), demand has been 109, 136, and 130 respectively (average ~125), resulting in consecutive stockouts despite on-hand inventory. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 23 that the low-demand phase (P16-P20) has ended. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture this higher demand level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4, covering P20-P23) to reflect this higher volume and volatility (average 111 including P20, or much higher if just P21-P23). By selecting recent_N with N=4, we transition away from the low-demand averages of Period 16-20 and cater to the current surge, while the OR backend's service level logic (profit $4 vs cost $1) will ensure a high enough base stock to mitigate the recent stockout trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: Demand rebounded from a low of ~75 (P16-P20) to an average of ~125 (P21-P23), causing three consecutive stockouts. This indicates a high-demand regime similar to P10-P14.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 21. After a period of low demand (P16-P20 average ~77), the last four periods (P21-P24) have shown significantly higher demand with values of 109, 136, 130, and 142 (average ~129). This surge has caused four consecutive stockouts because the OR backend's default parameters were lagging behind the shift. To stabilize inventory and maximize profit, I must increase the demand baseline (mu_hat) to capture this high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=4 focuses on this specific recent trend. Lead time remains consistently 0, and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same recent period to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P21-P24): Average demand increased to ~129, resulting in four consecutive stockouts (P21-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 21. After four consecutive stockouts where demand reached 109, 136, 130, and 142 respectively, Period 25 finally saw 140 units sold with 2 units remaining on-hand. The average demand over this current high-demand regime (P21-P25) is 131.4 units. The lead time consistently remains 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 80%. I am selecting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the significantly lower-demand period between P16 and P20, ensuring the OR engine bases its 'base stock' calculation on the current high-demand volatility and mean.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P21-P25) confirmed stable: Avg 131.4 units/period, ending 5-period stockout streak in Period 25.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a high-demand regime that began in Period 21. Since Period 21, demand has been 109, 136, 130, 142, 140, and 97. While Period 26 showed a slight dip to 97, the average across this 6-period regime is approximately 125.7 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. For Period 27, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and mean while discounting the much lower demand observed between Periods 16-20. Current on-hand inventory is 46, and with lead time 0, the base-stock target will determine the order amount to satisfy Period 27's demand. Profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) suggests a high service level (critical ratio = 0.8) is optimal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility throughout the history. After a high-demand regime from P21 to P25 (averaging ~131 units), demand in P26 and P27 has dropped sharply to 97 and 55 units respectively. This suggests a potential cooldown or a return to a lower-demand state, similar to the dip seen in P16-P20. On-hand inventory is currently at 87 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed by history up to P27), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the transition from the high-demand peak (P21-P25) through the current drop (P26-P27). This N value covers both the peak and the recent decline to provide a balanced buffer. I will use 'calculate' for L as it remains consistently at 0, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand is showing signs of a new regime shift or cooldown starting P26; demand dropped from a ~131 average (P21-P25) to 55 in P27. This follows a pattern of spikes followed by sharp declines seen earlier in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another cooling phase. Following the high-demand regime of P21-P25 (averaging ~131 units), demand in P26-P28 has dropped to 97, 55, and 80 respectively (averaging ~77.3). This cyclical pattern (spike followed by drop) was previously observed between P10-P15 and P16-P20. Currently, on-hand inventory is 63 units. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed by all history), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility of this drop. This should prevent over-ordering as we enter Period 29 while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 70-80 unit range.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooldown confirmed starting Period 26: Average demand for P26-P28 is ~77 units, down from ~131 in the preceding regime (P21-P25), consistent with previous cyclical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear cyclical pattern. After a high-demand regime (P21-P25, avg ~131), demand shifted to a lower regime starting Period 26. Periods 26-29 show demands of 97, 55, 80, and 103, resulting in an average of 83.75 units. This is consistent with the 'cooldown' pattern observed in carry-over insights. In Period 29, the inventory was exhausted (ending on-hand 0). To optimize for Period 30, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this most recent low-demand regime while remaining responsive to its volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time, so I will retain the default lead time setting.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit cyclical volatility. After a high-demand regime (P21-P25, avg ~131), we entered a cooldown phase starting in P26. For the period range P26-P30, demand has averaged approximately 80 units (97, 55, 80, 103, 65). This is consistent with the 'cooldown' identified in previous carry-over insights. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 37 units and the recent demand average of ~80, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P26-P30) to capture this lower-demand regime while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (sigma_hat also based on recent_N=5). This approach balances the lower mean demand with the high variance characteristic of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: The cooldown period has sustained for 5 periods (P26-P30) with an average demand of 80 units, down from 131 units in the previous peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a cyclical pattern of spikes followed by sustainment at a lower mean. Following the high-demand regime of Periods 21-25 (avg ~131), the current regime starting at Period 26 has stabilized at a lower level. For the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand was 97, 55, 80, 103, 65, and 108, yielding an average of 84.7 units. This confirms the 'cooldown' observed in carry-over insights. A stockout occurred in Period 31 because the previous order was calibrated for a lower mean after the dip in P30. To respond to this, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (matching the start of the current regime in P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the current stabilized volatility (~20.5 std dev) while acknowledging the shift away from the 130+ peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the previous peak (P21-P25). Since Period 26, demand has fluctuated between 55 and 108, with an average of approximately 85.8 units (P26-P32). The most recent demand (P31: 108, P32: 93) suggests a slight upward variance within this moderate regime compared to the deep lows of P27/P30. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this post-peak regime (P26 onwards). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=7 to accurately reflect the volatility observed in this specific regime, which is higher than the initial history but lower than the peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 86 units starting Period 26, following the high-demand peak of Period 21-25.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit cyclical regime shifts. After the cooldown observed starting Period 26 (avg ~80), the most recent demand in Period 33 jumped to 124, following a 93 in Period 32. This suggests we may be entering another high-demand phase similar to P21-P25 or at least a period of higher volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since Period 33 resulted in a stockout (124 demand vs 103 on-hand), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the period from P26 to P33) to capture the recent average of 90.75, but I will monitor for a sustained return to the >130 level. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Potential increase in demand volatility or regime shift observed in P33 (demand 124), following a period of stability (avg ~80) from P26-P32.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear regime shift back into a high-demand phase starting at Period 33. Demand in P33 was 124 and in P34 it was 130, both resulting in stockouts. This mirrors the previous high-demand regimes (P10-P14 and P21-P25) where demand averaged ~130. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the recent under-forecasting in P33 and P34, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent demand data to capture this spike. I'll use N=3 to cover the transition and the peak (P32: 93, P33: 124, P34: 130), yielding an average of roughly 115.7. Since L=0 (promised and observed consistently), mu_hat (1+L)*mean will be based on this recent window to ensure we satisfy the ~130 demand units expected in this high regime. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 33: Demand has returned to high levels (avg ~127 over last 2 periods), similar to peaks seen in P10 and P21, resulting in stockouts.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit cyclical regime shifts. After a sustained low-demand period (P26-P32, avg ~86), we are currently in another high-demand regime that began at Period 33. The demand values for the last three periods are 124, 130, and 103 (avg ~119). While Period 35 showed a slight dip to 103, the preceding two periods were significantly higher, and the game has a history of these spikes lasting 4-5 periods (see P10-P14 and P21-P25). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts seen in previous high-demand transitions, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand cluster (avg 119) and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat (encompassing both high and low periods) to account for current volatility. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P33-P35) continues with an average of ~119 units, following a stable period of ~86 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand regime starting at Period 33, with demand values of 124, 130, 103, and 115. The average demand for this 4-period window is 118 units, which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 86 units (P26-P32). In the 'recent_N' approach, N will be set to 4 to capture this current regime specific to the high-demand burst. Using N=4 for mu_hat ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock based on the average of these last four observations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility within this high-demand period. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P33-P36) persists with an average of 118 units, compared to the P26-P32 average of ~86. This aligns with cyclical demand spikes observed previously in the game (P10-P14 and P21-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand dropped significantly to 54 units, potentially signaling the end of the high-demand regime (P33-P36, avg ~118) and a return to the lower'cooldown' regime observed previously (P26-P32, avg ~86). Historical patterns show these spikes (P10-14, P21-25) typically last 4-5 periods before a sharp decline. Given the current on-hand inventory of 74 units, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average reflecting this transition (avg P33-P37 is ~105), which balances the risk of a continued drop against the possibility that P37 was just a single low outlier. The critical lead time remains 0 based on consistent history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand cooldown started Period 37: demand dropped to 54 units after a 4-period high-demand spike (P33-P36 avg ~118), mirroring previous cyclical patterns.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern of high-demand spikes (P33-P36 avg ~118) followed by sharp cooldowns. Period 37 (54) and Period 38 (40) confirm we have entered a cooldown regime, mirroring the shifts seen after Period 14 and Period 25. The current average for this new low regime (P37-P38) is 47 units, though historically these cooldowns stabilize closer to 75-80 units (e.g., P26-P32 avg ~86). With on-hand inventory at 91 units and a promised lead time of 0 periods, we are currently overstocked for the immediate low demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent sharp drop (P36-P38 avg = 69.6) while acknowledging the high variance (sigma_hat recent_N=6) to protect against a sudden rebound, which has happened previously. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooldown confirmed starting Period 37: demand dropped from a high-regime average of ~118 (P33-P36) to an average of 47 units over P37-P38, consistent with the cyclical volatility observed throughout the game.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern of high-demand spikes (P33-P36 avg ~118) followed by sharp declines. We are currently in a cooldown phase that began in Period 37. Demand over the last three periods (P37-P39) has been 54, 40, and 90, averaging ~61.3 units. This is consistent with previous cooldowns (e.g., P16-P20 avg ~75, P26-P32 avg ~86). Period 39's demand of 90 suggests the floor of this cooldown may be slightly higher than the previous two periods or that we are nearing the end of the dip. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower regime (P37-P39) while remaining responsive to the slight uptick in P39. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N with N=7 (covering both the end of the high regime and the current cooldown) to account for the high volatility inherent in these regime transitions and prevent stockouts if demand spikes again unexpectedly. Lead time L remains 0 as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooldown confirmed starting Period 37: average demand for P37-P39 is ~61 units, down from ~118 in the preceding spike (P33-P36).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in a 'cooldown' regime that started in Period 37. The last four periods (P37-P40) recorded demands of 54, 40, 90, and 67, resulting in an average of approximately 62.75 units. This follows a high-demand spike (P33-P36) where the average was ~118 units. Historical patterns show these low-demand cycles typically last around 5-7 periods before another spike. Since we are currently in period 4 of this low-demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower average and prevent excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to adjust to the current lower volatility and volume while we wait for the next cyclical spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its cooldown phase that started in Period 37. Since Period 37, demand values have been 54, 40, 90, 67, and 94 (Average ~69). This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P33-P36 avg ~118). There was a stockout in Period 41 because the previous order was too conservative for a demand of 94. However, the overall trend remains in the lower range. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P37-P41). Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0, so 'default' is appropriate. These parameters will help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the expected low demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility (94 vs 40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern of sharp spikes followed by cooldown periods. After a low-demand regime from P37-P40 (avg ~64), demand has spiked again in P41 (94 units, resulting in a stockout) and P42 (129 units, resulting in another stockout). This suggests we have entered a new high-demand regime similar to those seen in P10-P14, P21-P25, and P33-P36. To address the current stockout and capture the high-regime demand, I am shifting the mu_hat to reflect this new surge. I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on the immediate spike (avg 111.5), which is characteristic of the start of these peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The base stock policy will aim to cover this elevated demand to prevent further lost sales during this volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike began Period 41: Demand jumped from a ~64 average (P37-P40) to 94 (P41) and 129 (P42), resulting in back-to-back stockouts and signaling a return to a high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $451.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-demand regime, with the last 3 periods (P41-P43) averaging 113.7 units (94, 129, 118), significantly higher than the preceding cooldown (P37-P40 avg ~62.75). The current inventory is 21 units with no other units in transit. Historical cyclicality shows these spikes typically last 4-6 periods (P10-14, P21-25, P33-36). We are currently at Period 3 of this spike. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this peak demand and maintain high service levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history. Setting mu_hat to the recent average allows the OR backend to recalculate base stock for 1+0 periods of demand, ensuring we replenish enough to avoid further stockouts during this spike.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed starting Period 41: Average demand for P41-P43 is ~114 units, up from ~63 in the preceding cooldown (P37-P40), marking the 4th major cyclical spike observed in the game.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the 44th period, with only 6 periods remaining in the game. The product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a cyclical demand pattern. We recently transitioned from a high-demand regime (P41-P43 average demand approx. 114) to a potentially lower demand period, with Period 44 demand dropping to 70 units. This mirrors previous cycles (P10-14, P21-25, P33-36) where 3-5 period spikes are followed by sharp pullbacks. Given this cycle, I expect demand to stay lower (range 60-90) for the next 2-3 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 59 units. To avoid overstocking at the end of the game (which incurs holding costs) while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 (covering P41-P44) to capture the current transition, but rely on the backend OR logic to adjust for the promised lead time of 0. This balances the recent high spike with the current drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 44: Demand dropped to 70 units after a 3-period spike (P41-P43 avg ~114), suggesting the start of a typical 4-5 period cooldown phase as seen in previous cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern of sharp spikes (typically 3-5 periods) followed by immediate cooldowns. The most recent spike occurred in P41-P43 (average ~114). P44-P45 have shown a distinct cooldown (70 and 63 respectively), mirroring previous patterns where demand drops to an average of ~60-80 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0, with immediate same-period arrivals. To avoid over-ordering during this confirmed cooldown phase, I am selecting recent_N where N=2 to focus exclusively on the last two periods of the current low-demand regime. This will lower the order quantity, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level reflective of current observed demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooldown confirmed starting Period 44: Following the P41-P43 spike (avg ~114), demand has dropped to an average of 66.5 over P44-P45, consistent with the 4th major cyclical transition observed in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its cyclical pattern. We have just exited a high-demand spike (Periods 41-43, avg ~114) and are currently in a cooldown phase. Demand in Period 46 was 88, which is slightly higher than the previous two periods (70 and 63), but still significantly lower than the preceding peak. Based on previous cycles (e.g., P16-20, P26-32, P37-40), these cooldown regimes typically last 4-7 periods with demand averaging between 60-80 units. We are currently in the 3rd period of this cooldown (P44-P46 avg ~73.6). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this current regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the inherent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern. We are currently in a 'cooldown' phase following the 4th major spike (P41-P43). Specifically, demand since P44 has been 70, 63, 88, and 63, averaging approximately 71 units per period. This shift was correctly identified in previous carry-over insights starting at P44. The current inventory is 22 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs during this cooldown, I will set mu_hat to reflect the last 4 periods of demand (P44-P47) to capture this lower regime (N=4). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent period to reflect the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical pattern of high spikes (3-5 periods) followed by cooldown periods. We are currently in a cooldown phase that began in Period 44. Since the spike at P41-P43 (average ~114), demand has dropped to an average of 65.8 units over the last 5 periods (P44-P48: 70, 63, 88, 63, 45). The current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Given the game is ending at Period 50, and the lead time is reliably 0 periods, we should maintain a base stock level that covers this cooldown demand (~66 units) while accounting for the recent low visibility (45 units in P48). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach prevents excessive overstocking at the end of the game while maintaining sufficient service levels for the expected cooldown demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooldown regime (P44-P48) confirmed: average demand is ~66 units, significantly down from the P41-P43 spike (avg ~114 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The current demand regime (P44-P49) has stabilized at an average of ~68 units (70, 63, 88, 63, 45, 78), following the P41-P43 spike. This aligns with the cyclical nature of demand observed throughout the game (spikes followed by multi-period cooldowns). On-hand inventory is currently nearly depleted (1 unit). Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current cooldown regime's mean (~68) and variability. This ensures we order enough to satisfy the expected lower demand of the final period without overstocking, although holding costs for the final period are less of a concern than stockouts.
