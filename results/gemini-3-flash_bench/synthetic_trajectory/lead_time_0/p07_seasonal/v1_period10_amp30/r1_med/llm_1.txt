Looking at the five pre-game historical demand samples [76, 130, 159, 101, 78], the mean demand is approximately 108.8 units with significant variance (StDev ~35). Since I start with 0 on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, I must order enough to satisfy Period 1's demand. To avoid lost sales (each costing $4.0 in lost profit) while balancing holding costs ($1.0), I will aim for a level slightly above the historical average to provide a safety buffer. I'll target approximately 135 units to cover potential high-side demand, considering the highest historical point was 159 and the lowest 76.",
