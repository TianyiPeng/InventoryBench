A target stock of ~100-110 units is appropriate to prevent stockouts if demand returns to the 80-100 range, while avoiding excessive holding costs if it stays near 65.

The period 14-19 average is approximately 81 units, while the very recent 2-period average is 53 units.

Given the recent demand softening (38 and 68), having 150 units available is slightly aggressive but provides a safe buffer against the high volatility observed in this SKU (peaks of 146-157). \n5. **Final Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 67 units.

While the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), the primary goal remains to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs. The OR recommendation is 62 units, which is calculated based on a longer-term average and the critical fractile relative to the current on-hand inventory. Given the observed immediate decline in demand (moving from a high-volatility regime of ~120 to a current 4-period average of ~78), the OR recommendation of 62 is sound. It provides enough stock to cover a potential rebound to the ~140 range (83 + 62 = 145 total supply available for Period 48) without creating excessive holding cost risk if demand stays low.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 62 units. Recent demand has trended downward (63-90 range), and 145 total units available for the period provides sufficient buffer for demand volatility given the 0-period lead time.",

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed at Period 47: 4-period average has decreased to ~78 units (range 63-90) from the previous high-volatility average of ~121.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The supply chain continues to operate at a lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. We are currently in Period 49 of a 50-period game. In the final decision period, the objective is to satisfy expected demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. Historical demand analysis shows a moderation from Period 47 onwards, with a 3-period average of 62.3 units (63, 51, and the previous period's order reflected a lower outlook). The OR algorithm suggests 51 units based on its global average. Given the recent downtrend (demand dropped from 90 in P44 to 51 in P48), a quantity around the OR suggestion is prudent. On-hand inventory is 94 units. However, because demand is resolved AFTER the arrival phase, the 'starting on-hand' for Period 49 will be On-hand (94) + current order. If I order 0, I have 94 units to cover Period 49 demand. Since the highest demand in the recent moderate period was 90, and the last observed demand was 51, I already have enough on-hand to cover Period 49 without ordering more. To maximize profit and minimize holding cost for the conclusion of the game, I will order 0.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains highly volatile, moving between distinct regimes. Recent data (Periods 47-49) suggests a lower to moderate demand level (63, 51, 85). However, the carry-over insights indicate that moderation is often followed by sudden spikes (e.g., Period 40-42). The on-hand inventory is currently very low (9 units) after a decision not to order in Period 49. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. The OR algorithm recommends 136 units based on a base-stock policy. Given that demand can fluctuate between 50 and 150 units, and with only 9 units on hand, a stockout is a high risk if I undershoot. I will follow the OR recommendation of 136 units to restore inventory while accounting for the current high-demand potential (recent P49 demand was 85). This quantity (136 + 9 = 145 total supply) covers the high-end historical demand (approx 150) plus a small safety margin.",
