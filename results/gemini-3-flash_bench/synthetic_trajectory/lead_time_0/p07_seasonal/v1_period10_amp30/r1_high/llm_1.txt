  "rationale": "Objective: Maximize profit for 'chips(Regular)' over 50 periods. Initial State: On-hand 0, In-transit 0. Promised Lead Time: 0 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 76, 130, 159, 101, and 78 (Average: ~109 units/period). Demand Analysis: The demand shows significant variance but centers around 110. Lead Time Strategy: Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive in Period 1's arrival phase (before demand resolution). To find the optimal order quantity, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately plus maintain a small buffer for variance. Inventory Logic: Targeting a stock level that covers the expected average (~110) plus a safety margin to avoid stockouts on Day 1. I will order 140 units to ensure high service level given zero starting inventory and the potential for a high-demand realization (like Period 3's 159).",
