Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand data for the first five periods is available (76, 130, 159, 101, 78), showing an average of approximately 108.8 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The promised lead time is 0, which means orders placed now arrive within the same period. Since profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)), making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the review+lead period. I will use the average of the available 5 samples to set the initial demand forecast. Although we are in Period 1 of the simulation, we have been provided 5 pre-game historical samples to inform our priors. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean of these 5 samples (approx 108.8 * 1) and sigma_hat based on their standard deviation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 109 units with a lead time of 0. These arrived immediately and were sold out (109 sold vs 114 demand), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the first 5 periods (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) averages 108.8. The promised lead time is 0, and the observation from Period 1 confirms an actual lead time of 0. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). I will use the mean of the last 5 samples to set the mu_hat and the standard deviation of those samples for sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first two periods, we have observed a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand in both observed periods (114) has exceeded the supply provided by the OR backend (109 units), resulting in stockouts and lost sales. The historical demand data (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) shows significant variance. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the base stock policy targets a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), which is generally conservative. To address the immediate stockouts and capture the current demand level, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to better capture the higher demand seen in the conclude messages, and setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. This should help the backend adjust its stock levels closer to the actual demand mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility. The first two periods of demand were 114 (though we only sold 109 due to inventory caps), and the third was 86. The provided historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) also suggest a volatile environment with an average around 108. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have arrived within the same period (L=0) so far (P1, P2, and P3 concluded arrivals confirmed this). However, in P1 and P2, we stocked out, suggesting the 'cap' or base_stock selection was too low relative to demand. Given profit/holding are equal ($1.0), the service level target (q) is 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current local average (approx 105) and variance, ensuring the OR backend reacts to the most recent behavior while acknowledging the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of high demand volatility and stockouts (Periods 1, 2, and 4). Observed demand for the first four periods was 114, 114, 86, and 118 (mean = 108). The system has consistently confirmed a lead time of 0 periods. Since the ending inventory in Period 4 was 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to set parameters that cover the immediate demand of Period 5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I will use the recent 4 periods to capture the current mean and volatility, ensuring L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation shows sustained stockouts in Period 1, 2, 4, and 5. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, since we are consistently losing sales due to insufficient inventory (sold < demand in 4 out of 5 periods), the current base stock logic is underperforming. Demand history (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) shows a mean of ~109. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 5 historical data points. Because On-hand is currently 0 and we are missing demand, I will use a slightly more aggressive recent_N approach to capture the volume needed to prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost. mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods, so with L=0, it's 1 period of demand. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for both mu and sigma to stay responsive to the early demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (all 5 periods arrived same-day).

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 7. Data from the first 6 periods shows a consistent lead time of 0, which confirms the promised lead time is reliable. Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent values ranging from 75 to 121 (Mean: 104.7, Std Dev: 18.5). Periods 1, 2, 4, and 5 resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that the system's stock levels were insufficient to meet demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which leads to a base stock roughly equal to the mean. However, because stockouts were frequent, the 'observed' demand in those periods was likely truncated by available supply. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the current demand cluster while accounting for the lower demand in Period 6. Since on-hand is 36, the backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order while trying to recover from previous shortages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward shift from early peaks, though it remains volatile. The average demand across all 7 completed periods is 100.2 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show a slightly lower trend (avg 90) compared to the initial surge. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.50, implying the base stock should target the median demand (mu_hat). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while ignoring the very early outliers, and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a complete stockout (95 sold vs 119 demand), resulting in 0 ending inventory for Period 9. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand data shows significant volatility: Period_1-5 samples were [76, 130, 159, 101, 78] (Mean 108.8) and concluded demand for P1-P8 was [114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119]. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P4-P8), the mean demand is 101.4. Given the Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50. This means the OR backend should target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need a robust mu_hat to ensure we capture the demand expected in Period 9. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility accurately.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Analyzing the demand history (Periods 1-9): 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74, 119, 102. The mean demand is approximately 102.5. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand. Currently, the system has encountered several stockouts (sold < demand or ending inventory = 0), suggesting the order quantities have been slightly conservative. I will use recent history (N=9) to calculate the parameters, as the demand appears relatively stable but with high variance. Lead time is confirmed at 0, so L=0 (default) is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and stockouts in several periods (P1, P2, P4, P5, P8, P10), indicating that the current base stock calculations are consistently underestimating the potential demand spikes. The mean demand for the first 10 periods is approximately 106.3 units, but recent demand in Period 10 spiked to 140. Using EWMA with a higher gamma (0.4) will allow the forecast to react more quickly to these recent high-demand periods. Given that profit (1.0) equals holding cost (1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (z*=0). Since we are frequently stocking out, I will use a high sigma_hat to increase the base stock and provide a safety buffer against the observed high variance. Lead time is confirmed as 0, arrived same-day consistently.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (all 11 previous orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand over the last 11 periods shows a mean of approximately 102.8 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), demand has been slightly higher on average (approx 102.8 vs early periods) but remains volatile, ranging from 74 to 140. Given the high stockout frequency in P8, P10, and high demand in P10 (140), a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and volatility is used to capture current fluctuations. The base stock policy needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock will be close to the mean demand. I'm using recent_N=5 to adjust to the current demand levels (Avg P7-P11: ~102.6; Std Dev: ~27).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility, particularly in the most recent periods (P8-P12), with values ranging from 78 to 158. The average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 108. However, there's a slight upward trend in variance over the last 5 periods (mean ~111, std ~35). Lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over and historical conclude messages). With Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should aim for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the latest volatility and mean more heavily while maintaining a stable base for the OR engine's service level calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (13 out of 13 recorded observations), confirming that orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand has shown higher volatility and higher averages in the most recent five periods (mean of ~125.6) compared to the long-term historical mean (~111.5). Specifically, the last two periods (P12 and P13) saw demand levels of 158 and 150, significantly higher than the previous average. To ensure we capture this recent upward shift and mitigate the stockout risk seen in several previous periods (where ending inventory was 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 5. This allows the OR engine to react to the recent demand surge while acknowledging the observed 0-day lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Recent 5-period mean is 125.6, vs historical average of 111.5 (+12.6%), with a significant spike in P12-P13 (avg 154).

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P10-P14) exhibits a significantly higher mean (approx 130 per period) compared to the long-term average (approx 111). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P10-P14) show demands of 140, 78, 158, 150, and 124. While P11 was an outlier on the low side, the general trend indicates a shift toward higher volatility and volume. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this newer, higher demand regime while smoothing the high volatility observed in P12-P13. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the increased variance in this period.

Daily Profit: $99.00, Daily Holding Cost: $31.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 31. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been highly variable: 78, 158, 150, 124, 99 (mean 121.8). The 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 captures this recent volatility and higher mean compared to the lifetime average. Historical lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), so L=0 remains appropriate. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5. A 'recent_N' approach for sigma_hat (N=5) will provide a more responsive volatility estimate given the recent swings between high demand (150+) and moderate demand (<100).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 12, with demand ranging from 78 to 158 in the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. While Periods 12-14 saw a significant demand spike (averaging 144 units), Periods 15 and 16 saw a sharp decline to 99 and 58 units respectively. This suggests either a mean-reverting behavior or increased volatility following a peak. The carry-over insights indicate a regime shift (mean ~125.6), but the most recent two periods (P15-16) are significantly below this, bringing the 5-period average (P12-P16) to 97.8. Given the high volatility and the fact that lead time remains consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N window of 5 to balance the recent high spike with the recent drop, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen lately. This approach ensures we don't over-order into a potential downward trend while respecting the recent high-volume regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but elevated regime. Since Period 12, demand has fluctuated significantly (ranging from 58 to 158), with a mean of approximately 115.3 units over the last 6 periods. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels have been unstable due to high demand spikes (P12, P13), leading to stockouts despite starting on-hand quantities over 100. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current volatile regime while acknowledging the elevated average compared to the early game. This ensures the base stock reflects recent variability and prevents excessive stockouts seen when using longer historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe that the lead time consistently remains 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals. Demand has shown high volatility and a downward trend in the very recent periods (P16: 58, P17: 103, P18: 46). The mean of the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 86.0, which is significantly lower than the previous regime (P12-P13 mean of 154). Given the current on-hand inventory of 70 units and the recent demand drop, I will use a shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat to adjust the base stock downward to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the recent average. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture this recent spike in volatility (range 46 to 124 in the last 5 periods). Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Mean demand has dropped significantly to 86.0 over the last 5 periods compared to the previous high-demand regime of 125.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current observation shows on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Based on 'Period 19 conclude', the demand was 101, and our stock-out occurred as we only had 86 units available. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods. Regarding demand regimes: we previously identified a drop in demand at Period 18; however, the Period 19 demand of 101 suggests current demand is returning toward the long-term average (avg of all samples is ~104). The recent 5-period mean (P15-P19) is 81.4, which is significantly lower than previous regimes, but the bounce-back in P19 (101) indicates a possible end to that low-demand dip. Given the Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand for the period. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the low-demand trough of the last few periods (P16-P18), while relying on the OR backend's safety stock calculation to handle P19's recovery. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift and high volatility. Following a high-demand regime, a new regime was identified around Period 18. Current demand samples are: P16: 58, P17: 103, P18: 46, P19: 101, P20: 69. The mean of these last 5 periods (N=5) is 75.4, which is significantly lower than the previous regime average (125.6). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), the OR backend target service level (q) is 0.5. To adapt to this lower demand while managing the high volatility (std dev ~24), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime has shifted lower compared to the peak observed around Period 12-14. In the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand has been 46, 101, 69, and 109, averaging 81.25. While higher than the immediate post-drop average reported in Period 19, it is still significantly lower than the historical high-demand regime of 125.6. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (given profit and holding cost are equal, implying a critical ratio of 0.5/z-score of 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this stabilized lower demand profile. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a significant rebound in demand during Periods 21 (109) and 22 (136), following a brief cooling period. In Period 22, we stocked out, capturing only 82 units of a 136-unit demand. The carry-over insight from Period 19 noted a drop to a mean of 86, but the most recent 5-period average (P18-P22) has climbed back to 92.2, with the last two periods significantly higher. Given that lead time (L) is consistently 0, we must ensure the base stock covers current period demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this upward trend while buffering for the observed volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio is 0.5; the OR engine will target the median demand. By setting N=5, we balance the recent high spikes with the earlier lower values to avoid excessive holding costs while responding to the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 22 saw a sharp increase to 136 after a period of lower demand, resulting in a stockout. The mean of the last 3 periods is 104.7, indicating a recovery from the Period 18-20 dip.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a recent upward trajectory, with P22 (136) and P23 (130) indicating a recovery or upward shift from the lower demand seen between P18-P20. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after two consecutive stockouts. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover the service level while managing the $1.0 holding cost (which equals the $1.0 profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current regime's higher mean and variance (including the low P18-P20 and the high P21-P23) to avoid underestimating demand. Setting L to 0 ensures the OR backend targets the demand for the current period appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P22-P23 demand (avg 133) significantly higher than P18-P20 (avg 72), leading to stockouts. Regime N=6 mean is 98.5.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5. This means the OR backend's optimized base stock will target the median demand (0.5 quantile). We have observed a significant demand recovery starting at Period 22. In the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has been 136, 130, and 142 respectively (mean = 136). This is much higher than the period 18-21 dip (mean = 81). The system currently has zero on-hand inventory due to three consecutive stockouts. To capture this 'high regime' and mitigate ongoing stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the forecast quickly to this new higher level of demand and volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 22: Recent 3-period demand average is 136.0, compared to the previous Period 18-21 average of 81.25. High volatility (range 130-142) persists.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 22. Demand values for Period 22-25 are 136, 130, 142, and 140 respectively, yielding a 4-period average of 137.0. This is a dramatic increase from the Period 18-21 mean of ~81. We have experienced consistent stockouts or near-stockouts (sold < demand or zero ending inventory) because our previous ordering parameters were lagging behind this surge. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To stabilize and meet this new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using N=4 (capturing only this new regime) and utilizing an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed within this peak (range 130-142). This ensures the base stock calculation properly covers the expected demand spike plus a safety buffer for variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 22) shows a significant shift with higher mean and volatility. Average demand from Period 22 to 26 is 129 units (136, 130, 142, 140, 97), compared to the previous low period. While Period 26 saw a drop to 97, the preceding four periods were consistently high (avg 137). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current regime, I will set N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this higher-demand state while adjusting for the recent variability. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand for the period. The OR engine will subtract the current 40 units of on-hand inventory from the base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 22-27) shows a shift in the regime. After a high-demand peak (P22-P25 avg: 137), demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P26: 97, P27: 55). The average of the last 6 periods is approximately 110, but the sharp decline suggests we might be entering a lower demand phase or experiencing high volatility. Given the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the high recent volume while acknowledging the cooling trend from the last two periods. This N=6 covers the entire 'recovery/peak' regime and its subsequent drop. sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the current regime's volatility (ranging from 55 to 142). Lead time remains 0 as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but trend is downward: P26-P27 demand (avg 76) is significantly lower than the P22-P25 peak (avg 137).

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and regime shifts. After a high-demand peak (Periods 22-25, avg ~137), demand has cooled significantly in the last three periods (P26=97, P27=55, P28=80), with a recent average of approximately 77 units. This indicates a downward shift from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining service levels during this volatile phase, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P22-P28) for both mean and sigma. This window captures the recent peak and the subsequent drop, providing a balanced but responsive estimate (Mean ~111, Std Dev ~34) that accounts for the possibility of another sudden spike while respecting the current downward trend. Setting L to default (0) as all orders have arrived same-day.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled starting Period 26: Moving from a peak average of 137 (P22-P25) to a recent 3-period average of 77.3 (P26-P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) indicates a cooling period following a high-demand regime (Periods 22-25, avg ~137). Starting at Period 26, demand has significantly moderated: P26 (97), P27 (55), P28 (80), and P29 (103), resulting in a 4-period average of 83.75. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended Period 29 at 9 units. Given the shift at Period 26, I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture this new lower-demand regime for mu_hat (expected demand for Period 30) and sigma_hat (to account for the recent variance). This approach prevents over-ordering based on the high-demand peak while maintaining enough safety stock to manage the inherent volatility seen in previous weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the peak observed between Periods 22-25 (avg ~137). Since Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 80 units (97, 55, 80, 103, 65). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 19. Given the holding cost and profit are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which aligns with ordering the expected mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the current cooled demand regime (avg 80) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (std ~19). This approach balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding costs observed in previous periods when demand was over-forecasted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 26: 5-period average is 80.0 (range 55-103), significantly lower than the P22-P25 peak of 137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime starting around Period 26, following a significant peak in Period 22-25. The last 6 periods (P26-P31) show a mean demand of 84.7, which is a marked decrease from the peak average of 137. Period 31 saw a sudden stockout with demand at 108, which is above the recent 6-period mean but consistent with observed volatility (range 55-108). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized but volatile demand regime, I am using a recent window of N=6 to capture the current mean and variance. This will help prevent over-ordering based on the older high-demand peak while ensuring enough stock to handle spikes like the one seen in P31. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that balances the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (aiming for a 50% service level plus safety stock derived from sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 26: 6-period average is 84.7 (range 55-108), significantly lower than the P22-P25 peak of 137.

The demand regime has stabilized following the significant peak in Periods 22-25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted lower, with a recent 7-period average (P26-P32) of 85.8 units. The last two periods (P31-P32) resulted in stockouts due to lean ordering, even though demand (108 and 93) was within the normal variation of the current regime. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' regime while accounting for the recent volatility that caused stockouts. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a low-demand regime starting at Period 26 (avg ~85), but the last three periods (P31-P33) have shown an uptick (108, 93, 124) with an average of 108.3. This suggests a potential shift back to a higher demand level or at least higher volatility compared to the P26-P30 stability. The system currently has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, having stocked out in the last three periods. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To recover service levels and account for the recent upward trend while balancing holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target in the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current regime including the recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Periods 31-33 average 108.3, significantly higher than the Period 26-30 average of 80.0, suggesting an exit from the previous stable low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted upward again starting around Period 31. The last four periods (P31-P34) have seen demand of 108, 93, 124, and 130, averaging 113.75. This is a significant increase from the previous stabilized low-demand regime (P26-P30) which averaged 80.0. Current inventory is 0, and lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts (which have occurred in the last 4 periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. L remains default as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed at Period 31: Mean demand increased from 80.0 (P26-P30) to 113.75 (P31-P34), a +42% increase, leading to consistent stockouts.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 31. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) is 111.6, compared to the previous regime (P26-P30) average of 80.0. This represents a significant sustained increase (~40%). We have experienced several stockouts in this new regime (P31, P32, P33, P34), indicating that our base stock level was insufficient for the increased mean and volatility. In Period 35, demand was 103, slightly below the recent average but still high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this new regime's mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Setting parameters to recent values will allow the OR backend to raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and mitigate stockout risk.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting Period 31. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is 112.2, with recent values showing sustained high demand (130, 103, 115). Period 36 resulted in a stockout (sold 112, demand 115) despite an arrival of 101 units and starting inventory of 11 leftover from P35. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, but to prevent stockouts in a high-volatility environment and capture more profit, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation. This will ensure the base stock is centered on the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 31: Mean demand for P31-P36 is 112.2, significantly higher than the P26-P30 average of 80.0. Stockouts occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 31) has shown an average demand of 103.9 across 7 periods (108, 93, 124, 130, 103, 115, 54). Period 37 saw a significant drop to 54, which might be an outlier or the start of a cooling phase, but given the frequent stockouts in the preceding 6 periods, it is safer to maintain a forecast aligned with the higher regime while accounting for the recent volatility. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 59 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (the current regime length) to capture the higher mean while factoring in the Period 37 drop. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the high volatility observed (range 54-130). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P31 continues with mean 103.9 (P31-P37), despite a sharp drop to 54 in P37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a sustained high-demand regime (+42% increase from P31-P36), the last two periods (P37-P38) have shown a sharp decline (54 and 40 respectively), causing ending inventory to rise to 64. However, the carry-over history indicates that this SKU frequently transitions between regimes of high (~130) and low (~80) demand. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which aligns with the mean (base stock = mu_hat). Based on the most recent 8 periods (P31-P38), the mean is 96.5, but the last 5 periods (P34-P38) average 88.4. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent cooling phase while still accounting for the high volatility seen in the broader 'P31 regime', I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current regime's average, and N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (ranging from 40 to 130). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed: Period 37-38 average demand is 47, compared to the Period 31-36 average of 112, indicating a possible end to the high-demand regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cooling trend since Period 37. After a high-demand regime from P31-P36 (average ~112 units), demand dropped significantly in P37 (54) and P38 (40). Period 39 saw a slight recovery to 90 units, but the recent 3-period average (P37-P39) is 61.3, which is substantially lower than the previous regime. Given the current on-hand inventory of 6 units and a promised lead time of 0, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, including P35-P39, avg ~79.4) to capture the recent cooling while hedging against the slight rebound seen in P39. Lead time is consistently 0 (actual = promised). I will use default calculation for L and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to account for the recent volatility shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: 3-period average (P37-P39) is 61.3, compared to the Period 31-36 average of 112.2 (-45%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly entered a 'cooling' phase after a peak period (P31-P36 avg 112.2). The current regime, which started around P37, shows a 4-period demand history of 54, 40, 90, and 67, yielding an average of 62.75. This is a significant drop (~44%) from the previous high-demand period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. Given that profit/unit ($1.0) equals holding cost/unit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine's optimal base stock level will target the median of the demand distribution. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent 4-period regime (N=4) to avoid excessive holding costs while the demand stabilizes at this lower level. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to the most recent 4 periods to capture the current volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a cooling phase following a high-demand regime (P31-P36 avg: 112). Recent demand (P37-P41) shows a significant reduction with an average of 69.0. Period 41 demand was 94, resulting in a stockout since the ending inventory from P40 was 14 and the arrived order was only 49 (total 63 available). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the game history. I will adjust the demand parameters to reflect this recent lower-demand regime while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in P39 and P41. I'm using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current cooling regime (P37-P41: 54, 40, 90, 67, 94) which averages 69.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 22. This balances the need to avoid overstocking while preventing stockouts like the one observed in Period 41.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime sustained: 5-period average (P37-P41) is 69.0, a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P31-P36 avg: 112.2).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a more volatile phase after the 'cooling' period (P37-P41 avg: 69.0). Period 42 saw a sharp spike to 129, following a 94 in P41, indicating that the low-demand regime may have ended or is significantly more volatile than the P37-P40 average suggested. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock level should target the expected mean demand for the next period. Since the last two periods (P41-P42) averaged 111.5, which is much higher than the previous 4-period cooling average (61.3), I am shifting the forecast upward. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the transition from the low of P38 to the current spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike at Period 41-42: Demand increased from a 4-period average of 61.3 (P37-P40) to an average of 111.5 (+82%), ending the cooling regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again starting at Period 41. The last 3 periods (P41-P43) have an average demand of 113.7, which is a significant increase (+84%) from the previous cooling regime (P37-P40 avg: 62). Consecutive stockouts in P41, P42, and P43 confirm that the ordering parameters haven't adjusted quickly enough to this new high-demand spike. To prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 leads to a target service level of 50%), I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent peak. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 (arrived same-day), I will set L to explicit 0 to ensure the policy focuses on the current period's demand without unnecessary pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed at Period 41: Mean demand increased from 62.8 (P37-P40) to 113.7 (P41-P43), an 81% increase, causing sustained stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a period of cooling (P37-P40), a new high-demand regime emerged at P41, characterized by demand levels of 94, 129, and 118, followed by a sudden drop to 70 in P44. This drop to 70 prevents us from asserting the high-demand regime is still fully sustained at the 110+ level, but the earlier stockouts in P41-P43 suggest the system needs to be prepared for higher spikes. The 5-period mean (P40-P44) is 95.6. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but the backend's capped policy and the history of stockouts necessitate a robust mu_hat. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift that started in P41, providing a local mean of 102.75. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: P41-P43 averaged 113.7 causing stockouts, followed by a sharp drop to 70 in P44. The regime starting P41 is maintained as the primary forecast anchor.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains volatile. After a high-demand spike (P41-P43 average 113.7) that caused stockouts, demand cooled in P44-P45 to an average of 66.5. Despite this cooling, the 'Carry-over Insights' indicate a shift starting at P41. To maintain a safe service level while accounting for recent fluctuations, I will use a 5-period window (P41-P45) for demand mean and volatility calculation. This window captures the recent high-demand regime and the subsequent drop, providing a balanced forecast for the next period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

The most recent 'upward' regime shift was detected at Period 41 (P41-P43 avg ~114 units), but was followed by a subsequent dip (P44-P46 avg ~74 units). This high variance suggests using an intermediate window (N=6) to capture the current mean while accounting for recent swings. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (7 units), so parameters must ensure sufficient stock to meet upcoming demand. mu_hat is set to the mean of the last 6 periods (avg 93.7) to balance the high and low demand observed in the current regime (P41-P46). sigma_hat is also set via recent_N (N=6) to reflect this volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, but has entered a lower-demand phase relative to the P41-P43 peak (avg 113.7). The most recent 4 periods (P44-P47) have a mean demand of 71.0 (70, 63, 88, 63), which is a significant drop from the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed throughout the history. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level (the median). To ensure we don't over-order during this lower demand phase while accounting for the high volatility seen throughout the game, I will use a 7-period lookback (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent drop (P44-P47) while also including the tail end of the previous spike (P41-P43) to maintain a safety buffer against sudden recovery. Method: recent_N (N=7).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed at Period 44: 4-period mean (P44-P47) is 71.0, compared to the previous sharp spike of 113.7 (P41-P43), indicating a return to a lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained 'cooling' regime starting around Period 44. Over the last 5 periods (P44-P48), demand has averaged 65.8 units (70, 63, 88, 63, 45), which is a significant reduction from the previous spike (P41-P43 avg 113.7). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 45 units and recent demand trending lower (dropping to 45 in P48), I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using N=5 to capture the stability of the lower demand. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to account for the reduced volatility in this period range. This helps prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime sustained: 5-period average (P44-P48) is 65.8, down from the P41-P43 spike (avg 113.7).

Daily Profit: $66.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a cooler regime starting Period 44. Since that point (P44-P49), the demand samples are: 70, 63, 88, 63, 45, 78. The 6-period mean is 67.8, which is significantly lower than the preceding spike (P41-P43 average 113.7). The latest demand was 78, resulting in a stockout of 12 units (demand 78, sold 66) because the Period 49 order was too conservative. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the review+lead time period. With a lead time of 0, the backend will target covering demand for the current period (1+L=1). I will use the recent 6 samples (N=6) to capture this current cooling regime (starting P44) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the recent stockout with the overall lower trend.
