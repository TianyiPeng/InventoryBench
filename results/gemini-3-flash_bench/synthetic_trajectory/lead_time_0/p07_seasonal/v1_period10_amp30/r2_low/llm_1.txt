Analyzing the demand history, specifically periods 11-16 (ignoring the outliers in P10 and P13), the average demand is approximately 98 units (99, 103, 80, 119, 86). However, the high peaks of 146 and 157 indicate a need for a safety stock buffer to avoid stockouts, which are more costly than holding inventory ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost, but a stockout loses the entire profit margin). Promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand is 54. To cover a potential high-end demand swing (targeting roughly 145 units based on P10/P13 risks) for Period 17, I need 145 - 54 = 91 units. Given the recent average of 98 and the high variance noted in carry-over insights, placing an order of 96 units brings total availability to 150, which protects against all but the most extreme historical spikes while minimizing excessive holding costs.",
