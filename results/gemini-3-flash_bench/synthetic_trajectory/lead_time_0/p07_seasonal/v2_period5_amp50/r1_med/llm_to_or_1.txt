Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period, I have no order history to infer lead time or demand realization. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. The mean of these 5 samples is 102 and the standard deviation is approximately 36.8. Since I have 5 samples provided as 'historical demand data', I will use all 5 to set my initial parameters (recent_N=5). The backend will use these to calculate a base stock. Given L=0, the formula is (1+0)*mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+0)*std for sigma_hat. This approach provides a statistically sound starting point based on the provided history to cover the immediate demand of Period 1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 134 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived in the same period, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 0. Starting inventory was 134, demand was 126, leaving 8 units on hand. Historical demand over 5 periods (including Period 1 demand of 126) shows values of 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (mean: 102). Period 1 demand (126) is close to the recent sample (Period 5: 128) and slightly above the historical average. I will use the 'default' method for L since it matches the observed behavior (L=0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the very low Period 4 reading (43). This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the current demand level plus the safety stock buffer required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $465.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for the first two periods was 126 and 119. However, the historical data provided in the prompt shows demand values for Periods 1 through 5 (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) which contradicts the game history for the first two periods (126, 119). I will prioritize the live game history (126, 119) and the current Period 3 starting state. Mean demand is approximately 122.5. With L=0, mu_hat should target 122.5. Sigma_hat is calculated from the two observations (126, 119), which have a standard deviation of about 4.95. Using recent_N=2 for both parameters to reflect the realized demand trend of the current session.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 3 concluded periods (and 5 provided demand samples). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals for Period 1, 2, and 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Observed demand for the first three periods was 126, 119, and 51. The five demand samples provided are [137, 92, 110, 43, 128]. There is a discrepancy between the samples and the game history; however, the game history shows a significant drop in demand in Period 3 (51 units) compared to Periods 1 and 2 (~120 units). With on-hand inventory at 76, we are well-stocked for a low-demand scenario but need to protect against the higher demand seen in Periods 1-2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility and potential downward shift while maintaining a buffer. Sigma will use 'default' to account for the overall historical variance. Lead time 'L' will remain 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a significant downward trend: Period 1 was 126, Period 2 was 119, but then it dropped sharply to 51 in Period 3 and 18 in Period 4. The initial provided sample data (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) suggests a highly volatile demand, but the most recent realized demand values indicate a potential regime shift or a localized low-demand period. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this downward trend, while keeping L at default (0) and sigma_hat at default to account for the overall historical volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 demand data points: 126, 119, 51, 18, and 84 (note: the provided historical demand samples in the prompt [137, 92, 110, 43, 128] differ from the actual game history provided in the status log; I will prioritize the observed game history). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 79.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 46. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments to date have arrived with L=0. In Period 5, no order was placed (ordered=0) because ending inventory from Period 4 (111) was high compared to demand. Currently, we have 27 units on hand and 0 in transit. To determine the order for Period 6, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history which shows significant variation (ranging from 18 to 126). Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked significantly to 158 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 119 units, ending inventory 0). The last 3 periods (P4: 18, P5: 84, P6: 158) show high volatility, but the average demand over all periods (P1-P6) is approximately 92.6 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I need to ensure the base stock covers the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand while smoothing out the extreme low in Period 4. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed in recent periods. The lead time L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. A review of the history shows that in the last two periods (6 and 7), we stocked out because demand (158 and 134) exceeded our starting inventory (119 and 133). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) plus the observed demand in the game history (126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134) suggest a mean demand of approximately 100 units, but with significant volatility and recent high-demand periods. I will set the lead time to 0 (default). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 4 (covering periods 4-7: 18, 84, 158, 134) to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the volatility. This N balances the low period 4 with the high periods 6 and 7. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall variance of the full dataset to ensure enough safety stock given the recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is consistently observed across Periods 1-4 and 6-8. In Period 8, demand dropped significantly to 55 after two high-demand periods (158 in P6, 134 in P7). Looking at the provided historical samples (P1-P5) and game history (P1-P8), the demand is quite volatile: {137, 92, 110, 43, 128} from pre-game and {126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55} from gameplay. In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (158 demand vs 119 on-hand), and in Period 7, demand was effectively capped at 133 by stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand variance while normalizing the recent spike and dip. I will use the default sigma_hat to account for the overall high volatility (std dev of the full sample set is roughly 44). Current on-hand is 80, which provides some buffer, but the OR backend needs updated stats to place a sufficient order for the zero lead-time environment.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 55 units with 0 in-transit. Evaluating the demand history for 'chips(Regular)', there is significant volatility. Recent demands were 158 (P6), 134 (P7), 55 (P8), and 72 (P9). The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 90.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, as confirmed by conclude messages from P1-P4 and P6-P9. Although demand varies, there is no clearly sustained new regime yet; however, the recent average (approx 104 over last 4 periods) is slightly higher than the overall average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture a broad but relevant sample of the fluctuating demand. Setting L=0 as per historical confirmation.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 18 to 158 units. The mean demand across these 10 periods is 89.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 44 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the history, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. There is no clear seasonal or regime shift evidence yet, but there have been stockouts in Periods 6 and 7 where demand exceeded starting inventory. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current variability and mean while ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (approx 80% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 after a high demand period (Period 11: 149 units). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand mean is approximately 95 units across the 11 periods of play and 5 pre-game samples (all samples: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149). The demand in recent periods (6-11) has shown higher volatility and two spikes exceeding 145 units. Given that we are starting at 0 stock, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher mean (approximately 108) and volatility from the latter half of the history to ensure better service levels and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 6, 7, and 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 12 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will maintain L=0. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant variability, ranging from a low of 18 (Period 4) to a high of 158 (Period 6). The mean demand over 12 periods is approximately 94.6. However, looking at the full history including the first 5 periods provided in the prompt (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), and the observed game history, there is no clear stable regime. In Periods 6, 7, and 11, we experienced stockouts or near-stockouts (sold limited by on-hand). The recent demand has dropped from 149 (P11) to 90 (P12). Because of the high volatility and the frequency of stockouts despite a 0 lead time, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture a more localized demand mean and variance to better guard against recent high-demand spikes while avoiding over-investing in inventory from the very early low-demand periods (like P4). This balances the high Profit/Holding ratio (4:1), which justifies a target service level of 80% (q=0.80).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant variability over the last 13 periods, ranging from 18 to 158 units. The average demand across all historical data (13 periods) is 93.38. However, there are visible spikes (P6, P7, P11) and troughs (P4, P8, P9, P10). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical target service level is 80% (z\u22480.84). To capture the recent variability without overreacting to single-period outliers like Period 11 (149), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8. This covers the most recent regime of high volatility while smoothing the data. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods according to all conclude messages, so I will stick with the 'default' lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 58 units with 0 in-transit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent shifts in both mean demand and standard deviation, ensuring we minimize stockouts during spikes while managing holding costs during troughs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed in the historical data (P1-P14). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent periods ranging from a high of 149 (P11) to a low of 25 (P14). Over the 14 concluded periods, the average demand is approximately 88 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P10-P14) average 84.4 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), the critical fractile is 0.80, which favors maintaining a healthy buffer against stockouts, especially since stockouts occurred in P6, P7, and P11. I will use the recent 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while dampening the impact of the very low demand in Period 14 (possibly an outlier or part of a cycle). Since actual lead time is consistently 0, the 'default' method is appropriate for L.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but remains within a steady long-term range. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the review + lead time is short (1 period), the backend needs accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat to manage both stockouts (seen in P6, P7, P11) and high holding costs (seen in P14). I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior, which averages 88.3 units per period. This window is chosen to balance responsiveness to recent fluctuations while maintaining statistical stability. No clear seasonal regime shift is detected yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand was 182, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand over the last 16 periods has shown high volatility, with a mean of approximately 95 units and a standard deviation of roughly 48. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) has been 149, 90, 78, 25, 93, 182 (mean 102.8). Since lead time is consistently 0, the order target should focus on covering the current period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent mean and volatility, which includes both the low outlier (25) and the high outlier (182), to prepare for continued high demand while managing holding cost risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility but generally oscillates around a mean of approximately 95 units per period. In the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the mean demand is 95.8, with occasional spikes (P11: 149, P16: 182) and dips (P14: 25). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-period), as reflected in all 'conclude' messages. Currently, we have 77 units on hand and 0 in transit. To maximize profit while balancing potential stockouts against the $1/unit holding cost, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture the recent mean (approx 96 * (1+0) = 96). Given the periodic high spikes (specifically P16), I will use a conservative sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (standard deviation is approx 47.78) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but averages around 95-100 units per period. Recent periods show a slight upward trend in variance (e.g., Period 16 demand was 182). Given the 0-period lead time, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 captures the current demand levels (average around 100) while allowing for recent variability. sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to account for the intermittent spikes in demand observed recently (Periods 11 and 16).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows high volatility but no sustained shift in the mean over the last 19 periods (average demand is ~94 units). Period 19 demand was low (47), following a period of moderate demand. Given the chip category of this SKU, demand is prone to spikes (e.g., P6, P11, P16 reached 140-180 units). To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the full breadth of recent demand volatility while smoothing out the very low demand of the immediate last period. This will balance the inventory level to handle potential upcoming spikes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Across 20 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will maintain L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but remains relatively stable around a mean of approximately 95 units. Specifically, demand samples for the last 20 periods are: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149, 90, 78, 25, 93, 182, 73, 71, 47, 86. The calculated mean of these 20 samples is 89.5 units. Given the high stockout frequency in earlier periods (Periods 6, 7, 11, 16) when demand spiked above 130, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the full historical range and ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover high-demand events while respecting the profit/holding cost balance ($4/$1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability but remains relatively stable around a mean. Over the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the mean demand is approximately 86.8 units (total 868 / 10). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. However, there have been stockouts in Period 6, 7, 11, and 16 when demand spiked significantly above the inventory set. Given the current low on-hand inventory of 4 units and the historical demand distribution, I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to recent volume shifts with sufficient data to capture volatility. L=0 remains consistent with the observed data.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. Based on the historical demand from Period 1 to Period 22, the average demand is approximately 93.6 units per period, while the standard deviation is approximately 43.6. There aren't specific dates provided to infer calendar-based seasonality, and the demand appears to fluctuate around this mean without a clear sustained shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the service level target q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8, the base stock should cover the current period's demand (L=0 means we need to cover 1 period of demand). I will use the recent 15 periods to calculate the mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while smoothing out extreme outliers like the low demand in Period 14 or high demand in Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but generally adheres to a mean-reverting pattern around 90-100 units. Period 23 had an unusually low demand of 22, leading to a high ending on-hand inventory of 102 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the on-hand inventory (102) is already close to the average demand, and the OR engine will subtract this from the calculated base stock, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=10) to capture recent demand variability while avoiding over-ordering after the stock-up from Period 23. This will set a safety buffer for typical demand spikes (e.g., 120-150 units seen in P16, P21, P22) while accounting for the high on-hand balance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 24 periods has shown significant volatility without a clear sustained regime shift, fluctuating between 18 and 182 units. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 89.5 units. Given the high variance and the stockouts observed in periods 6, 7, 11, 16, and 22, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while maintaining responsiveness to current trends. L is set to default as 0-period delivery is stable. mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 will base the order on the most recent 10-period average (~90) and standard deviation to protect against the frequent spikes seen in the history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but relatively stable mean behavior over the last 25 periods. Historical demand averages approximately 92.5 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is slightly higher at approximately 92.0 units, with peaks reaching 182 and troughs at 22. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a 10-period window to capture recent demand mean and volatility while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance observe. Setting L to 0 (promised) as no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost orders exists.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent variability but no clear long-term upward or downward trend. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the average demand is 85.8 units, while the lifetime average (P1-P26) is approximately 91.2 units. The most recent demand was 120 units. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed by all 26 periods of history), the order placed in Period 27 will arrive and be used to satisfy Period 27 demand. Currently, there are only 10 units on-hand. We need to target a base stock level that covers the immediate demand with a high service level (profit is 4x the holding cost). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand cluster (avg ~86) and default for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility (std ~40 across the full sample). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits significant variance. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 89.7 units, and the last 3 periods show a slight upward trend (110, 120, 112). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=10 to capture this current demand regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will continue to use the default lead time setting. With the current on-hand inventory at 8 units and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a high service level is critical to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown more stability in recent periods (P25-P28) with demand values of 110, 120, 112, and 100, averaging 110.5. This follows a more volatile period where demand fluctuated significantly. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently actualized in the history (confirmed through P28). I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I'll use a recent window of N=4 to capture this current high-demand cluster (avg 110.5) which is higher than the long-term historical mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility relative to the entire history, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the high demand while minimizing excess inventory costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand shifted to a higher, more stable regime around Period 25 (avg ~110 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 110 units since Period 25. Historical demand from P25 to P29 shows values of 110, 120, 112, 100, and 107. The average of these 5 periods is 109.8, confirming the shift reported in the carry-over insight. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrival in the same period). To capture this regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher mean and lower volatility compared to the full history. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the new demand profile while minimizing holding costs.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 25. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the mean demand is approximately 111.5 units, which is significantly higher and more consistent than the historical average from early periods. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. At the end of Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we must order enough to cover Period 31 demand entirely. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 6-period window (N=6) to capture this sustained shift while maintaining a responsive base stock level. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. The last 7 periods (P25-P31) show a mean demand of approximately 116 units (110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146), which is significantly higher and more consistent than the earlier game history. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To prevent stockouts seen in P30 and P31, where demand peaked at 120 and 146, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=7) to capture this current regime's higher volume and volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 25: Average demand increased to ~116 units with higher peaks (up to 146 in P31) compared to the initial 24 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 25. Prior to this, demand was highly volatile with frequent stockouts (e.g., P6, P11, P16, P22). Since Period 25, the demand has stabilized at a higher level, but the last two periods (P31 and P32) saw sharp spikes (146 and 183 units respectively), leading to total stockouts and an ending inventory of 0. The current mean since Period 25 is approximately 124 units, but the recent three-period trend (P30-P32) shows an average of 149.6 units, indicating a possible further upward shift or high-season volatility. Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the pattern of stockouts, I will use a recent_N window (N=8, covering the regime change since P25) to capture the higher mean and increased variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Average demand increased significantly from ~110 to ~150 units over the last three periods, resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $262.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift to a higher mean (~116-150 units) was identified between Periods 25-32, Period 33 saw a sharp drop to 82 units. This follows a pattern of extreme spikes (e.g., 183 in P32, 146 in P31) followed by sudden drops, making it difficult to pinpoint a single stable mean. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time remains 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the system should prioritize service levels to capture spikes while being mindful of the high stockouts observed in P30-P32. I will use a recent_N of 9 (Period 25 to 33) to capture the current high-variance, high-mean regime that started around P25, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this more representative activity rather than the lower-demand early periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and recent shifts. Carry-over insights and historical data show a significant regime change starting around Period 31, where mean demand spiked to ~150 units, though the most recent periods (P33-P34) saw lower demand (82 and 31). This variability suggests the higher regime average of ~115-120 (since P25) is more representative than the full history, but we must also account for the volatility seen in periods like P32 (183). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent higher demand regime (P25-P34) while allowing the OR backend to calculate appropriate safety stock for the high variance. L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly increased volatility and mean shifts since Period 25 and especially Period 31. Recent demand samples starting from Period 31 are [146, 183, 82, 31, 66]. While including the low demand from Period 34 (31 units) and Period 35 (66 units) suggests a potential cooldown, the regime since P31 still averages ~101.6 units, but with a \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 wide range (31 to 183). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), it is safer to maintain a higher service level by using a recent window that captures this heightened volatility. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-variance environment. I will stick with the promised lead time of 0 as it has been consistently honored.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains highly volatile following the Period 31 shift; while recent points (P34-35) are lower, the range [31, 183] necessitates higher sigma_hat tracking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a structural shift that began around Period 25 and intensified at Period 31. Period 36 demand reached 166 units, causing another stockout (on-hand is 0). The last 6 periods (P31-P36) show demands of 146, 183, 82, 31, 66, and 166 (mean ~112, but with extreme variance). I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent high-volatility regime. For sigma_hat, I will use N=12 (covering the shift from P25 onwards) to ensure the backend accounts for the increased standard deviation (roughly 52) which is significantly higher than the early game. This high sigma is necessary to prevent stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed high volatility: Demand cycles between extreme highs (>160) and lows (<40), requiring significantly higher sigma_hat to maintain service levels.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a significant regime shift that occurred around Period 31. Recent demand values include P36: 166 and P37: 114. The average demand since P31 is approximately 114.6 units, but the standard deviation has spiked significantly due to the swing between 31 and 183. Current on-hand inventory is 34 with no units in transit. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current volatile regime and ensure sufficient stock to cover the high-demand spikes while balancing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the period since the P31 shift). This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the sharply higher variance observed recently.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the regime shift identified at Period 31. Recent demand observations (P31-P38) are: 146, 183, 82, 31, 66, 166, 114, 59. This data confirms a high-variance pattern where demand can spike above 160 or drop below 40. Given the current on-hand inventory of 101 units and the most recent demand of 59, we are currently in a relatively safe position, but must prepare for the next potential spike. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the duration since the P31 shift) to capture the current mean of ~106 units. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=8 to account for the high volatility observed in this specific regime (std ~54), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the next high-demand period while balancing against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime since Period 31, characterized by extreme swings between high demand (>160) and low demand (<40). The average demand over the most recent 9 periods (P31-P39) is approximately 105 units, but the standard deviation is significantly higher than in the early stages of the game. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To handle this volatility and avoid stockouts seen in P31, P32, and P36, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this specific volatile regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher variance while maintaining an appropriate service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% target service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P40) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 31 to 183 units and an average of approximately 104 units. While the mean has stabilized slightly compared to the surge seen around P31-P32, the variance remains significant. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the high volatility and prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 10 periods (P31-P40) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This 'recent_N' approach specifically targets the current volatile regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent, but the OR backend effectively sees L=0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a recent upward shift in magnitude. Period 41 saw a demand of 184, causing a stockout. Over the last 11 periods (P31-P41), the mean demand has risen to approximately 111 units, but more critically, the variance has spiked significantly with values ranging from 31 to 184. To safeguard against these frequent stockouts and capture the high-end pulses (like 166 and 184), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this volatile regime. I am also using explicit sigma_hat to reflect the high standard deviation observed in this period (approx 52), ensuring the OR engine maintains a higher base stock to improve service levels despite the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 31. Recent demand has fluctuated between extreme lows in the 30s-60s (P34, P35, P38, P39, P40) and extreme highs exceeding 160 (P31, P32, P36, P41). The mean since Period 31 is approximately 107 units, but the standard deviation has spiked significantly (approx 52). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the spike observed in Period 41 (184 units) followed by Period 42 (113 units) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the low periods, I will use recent_N=12 to capture this volatile regime (P31-P42). This period (P43) starts with 37 units on hand. The OR engine needs a high sigma_hat to account for the volatility and a mu_hat reflecting the recent average to maintain a high service level for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased from Period 31: Mean ~107, Standard Deviation ~52, with demand peaks reaching >180 units and troughs as low as 31 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 31, characterized by extreme swings (range: 31 to 184). The mean demand since P31 is approximately 107.5 units, which is similar to the overall historical mean, but the variance has spiked significantly (Standard Deviation \u2248 52). Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, yielding a critical ratio of 0.8. Given the frequent stockouts in this volatile regime (P31, P32, P36, P41), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 periods (P31-P43) to capture this increased risk while maintaining a lead time of 0 as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher uncertainty in its base stock calculation to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the regime shift identified around Period 31. Recent demand (P41-P44: 184, 113, 44, 63) confirms this high variance, which necessitates a responsive forecasting approach. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs during troughs, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using the last 14 periods (P31-P44) captures the high-volatility regime (Mean ~102, Std Dev ~51). Setting N=14 for both parameters ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that reflects this increased risk profile without being overly influenced by the relatively quieter first 30 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 50-60) since the regime shift around Period 31. Recent demand (P41-P45: 184, 113, 44, 63, 114) averages 103.6. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime while acknowledging that the lead time remains stable at 0. Since we are at Period 46 of 50, maintaining a buffer for the remaining periods is key to avoiding stockouts during the frequent high-demand spikes observed (e.g., 184 units in P41). On-hand is currently 29 units, and no units are in-transit, which matches the lead-time 0 expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, oscillating between extremes (e.g., Period 43 demand: 44, Period 46 demand: 148). Period 46 resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the existing parameters haven't sufficiently buffered against the upper tail of this high-variance regime. Since Period 31, demand has been characterized by a mean near 100-110 but with frequent spikes exceeding 140. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the period from the known regime shift at Period 31 to now). This will better capture the current volatility (sigma) and average demand than a full history average, ensuring the OR engine sets a higher base stock to prevent stockouts during the final periods of the game. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P31 shift: P46 demand of 148 confirmed that spikes above 140 are frequent, while the mean remains around 107 in this regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a highly volatile regime that started around Period 31. Recent demand observations (P46: 148, P47: 137) confirm that demand remains elevated and fluctuates significantly. Since Period 31, demand has ranged from 31 to 184. The current critical challenge is managing this high variance with a promised lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (9 units). To set OR parameters, I'll use a recent window (N=17, covering Period 31 to Period 47) to capture both the mean (~106) and the high standard deviation (~51). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current wide-swing environment, allowing the backend to calculate a sufficient base stock to avoid stockouts during demand spikes while accounting for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $268.00, Daily Holding Cost: $80.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 remains characterized by high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 52) and a mean of approximately 107. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 49, the on-hand inventory is 80 units. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=18 (capturing the regime since P31) ensures the OR backend uses the relevant mean for this localized period. I am setting sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 65 to provide a slightly larger buffer than the historical standard deviation of this regime (approx 52), as the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) favors a high service level to avoid stockouts seen previously in this regime (e.g., P31, P32, P36, P41, P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 remains highly volatile with a mean of approximately 102 units and a high standard deviation (approx 50). Recent demand has fluctuated between 67 and 148 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 72, which is below the recent average demand of 102, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this high-volatility regime starting from Period 31, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes up to ~180 units while balancing the $1/period holding cost against the $4 profit.
