  "rationale": "We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Historically, demand is quite high (Avg ~102 over 5 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize profit while respecting the holding cost ($1.0/unit), I need to cover the immediate demand for Period 1. Based on historical data (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), I will aim for a value near the higher end of the distribution to ensure high service level, as stockouts on a $1 profit item are costly, though holding cost is also high.
