Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) plus the first period's actual demand (125) suggest a mean of approximately 106 units per period.

Justification: Total demand for P2 is likely around 110-130. Total inventory needed = Demand_P2 + Safety Stock. With 39 on hand, ordering 124 (as OR suggests) provides a total availability of 163 units. This comfortably covers the highest historical demand (137) plus a buffer.

Looking at the OR logic: \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 101, \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 28. With profit=$19 and holding=$1, the critical fractile is 0.95 (z* \u2248 1.645).

Inventory: Current on-hand inventory is 99 units with zero pipeline inventory. 3. Demand Analysis: The average demand over the last 28 periods is approximately 100 units (Sum: 2798 / 28 = 99.9). The OR model's recommendation of 66 units aims for a target stock level around 165 units (99 + 66). Looking at the history, this target of ~165 consistently covers demand except for high outliers (e.g., Period 6 demand 163, Period 26 demand 190). 4. Adjustment: Since lead time is 0, we can react quickly. The current stock (99) plus OR's order (66) equals 165 units. This provides a safety buffer for most fluctuations without incurring excessive holding costs. No definitive seasonal trend or regime shift is detected to justify an override of the data-driven cap.",

Based on the consistent observation that the actual lead time is 0 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical 'conclude' messages), an order placed in Period 40 will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 40 demand. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability, ranging from approximately 20 to 190 units, with a mean around 100 units. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 42 units, which would bring the total available inventory (On-hand + Order) to 165 units.

This base-stock level has been generally sufficient to cover demand except for extreme spikes (like Period 26).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is 95 units. Based on historical data, the lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive in time for Period 50 demand. Average demand over the last 49 periods is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation around 39 units. The OR recommendation is 65 units, which targets a base stock of roughly 160 units (95 on-hand + 65 order = 160). Period 50 is the final period of the game. Since any leftover inventory results in a loss due to the holding cost ($1.0) and there are no future periods to sell it, the optimal strategy for the final period is to order just enough to cover likely demand without over-stocking. Historical demand has exceeded 160 only twice in 49 periods. My goal for this final period is to satisfy demand while minimizing the 'ending inventory' part of the reward equation. Given current on-hand of 95, a small order is prudent to handle the mean demand (approx 96). I will increase the OR recommendation slightly to 70 units to ensure a total availability of 165 units, which covers ~94% of historical demand scenarios while keeping the potential holding cost penalty manageable.",
