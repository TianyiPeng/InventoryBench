Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical 'conclude' messages to confirm the actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 0. Based on the provided demand history (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean demand is 102 and the standard deviation is 34.02. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the product ('chips') likely has stable but variable demand, I will use the 'default' methods which calculate stats across all available samples. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level to avoid stockouts. Initial parameters will set a baseline for this new SKU.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 164 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. The demand was 126. We are now at the start of Period 2 with 38 units on hand. Historical demand samples (including Period 1) are [137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 126]. The mean is approx 106 and std dev is approx 33. Since there is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet in these early samples, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to set the base stock level. The backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) demand, and with L=0, we are essentially ordering to cover the upcoming period's demand minus current stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2216.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the actual lead time has been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 126 and Period 2 was 119. These are significantly higher than the initial historical samples (which averaged 102 across 5 periods and included several low values like 43 and 92). The current 'recent_N' average for the 2 observed periods is 122.5. Since the game is in the early stages and current demand levels are higher than the pre-game samples, I will use recent_N=2 to capture this elevated demand level for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=2 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $889.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the conclusion of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1, 2, and 3) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management for LT=0 requires covering the demand for the current period only. Historical demand samples are 137, 92, 110, 43, and 128 (note: the demand sequence provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' section differs slightly from the 'Game History' observations, but both suggest a mean demand around 100). Specifically, game history demand for P1-P3 was 126, 119, and 51, indicating a possible downward shift or high variance. Given the small sample size and the significant drop in P3, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining some buffer. With LT=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for 1 period (1+0). The OR backend uses the critical ratio (19/(19+1) = 0.95), which is aggressive. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods helps adapt to the recent demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by four consecutive successful arrivals within the ordering period. The initial demand appeared stable around 120 units but has dropped significantly in the last two periods (51 and 18). However, historical data provided for P1-P5 shows: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. This suggests high volatility rather than a permanent downward regime shift. Since the demand for P5 was 128 (according to historical data provided), the average across all 5 periods is approximately 102. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (0.95), justifying a relatively high safety stock. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history confirms L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) because the data suggests high variance rather than a clear shift, and we need to be prepared for the higher demand peaks (like P1 and P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1517.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been 126, 119, 51, 18, and 84. The mean demand is approximately 79.6 with a standard deviation of 45.9. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). There is currently an ending inventory of 79 units on hand and 0 in transit. Since L=0, the target base stock (calculated by the OR backend as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) should cover the current period's demand. I will use all 5 historical samples to estimate demand parameters as there is no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet, though the volatility is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2945.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked significantly to 158 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 155 of 155 units). This spike follows a period of volatile demand: P1 (126), P2 (119), P3 (51), P4 (18), P5 (84), and P6 (158). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 92.7 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently been met in every concluded period (P1-P6). Given the recent stockout and the high volatility (standard deviation of ~53 units), the target inventory level needs to be robust. Since the profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), the optimal service level is 95% (q = 19/20). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility while adjusting for the recent upward trend in demand. L is set to 'default' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2501.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the seven concluded periods, we have observed a mean demand of 98.57 units with a standard deviation of 48.42. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. In Period 6, we experienced a stockout because the demand (158) exceeded the total inventory available (155), resulting in 3 lost sales. This indicates that while the mean is around 100, the volatility is high enough to require a robust safety stock. We have 45 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. For Period 8, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the full historical variability while staying responsive to recent trends. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $919.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-8 confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent values ranging from 18 to 158. Period 6 saw a stockout due to high demand (158 units), while Periods 4 and 8 saw significant drops (18 and 55 units respectively). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 95% (19/20 = 0.95). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent high-variance regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock to prevent further stockouts. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1256.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the first 9 periods. Recent demand (P6-P9) averages roughly 105 units. Although the provided samples (P1-P5) averaged 100.6, the sequence of demand since P1 is 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72. There is no clear sustained shift to a new regime, but demand is inconsistent. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded orders. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the full historical context since the game started, ensuring we cover the high-demand spikes (P6, P7) while accounting for the low-demand periods (P4, P8). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that inventory levels against these fluctuations. L is set to default (0).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility across the first 10 periods, with demand values ranging from 18 to 158. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 89.7 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there are no specific calendar dates or product descriptions to suggest a seasonal shift, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (setting N=10 to utilize the full history since no distinct regime shift is prominent). The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that balances the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2818.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout all 11 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (13 units). Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent periods ranging from 55 to 149. The mean demand over all available periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 96 units, while the mean of the 11 observed game periods is 100. Average demand across all 16 samples is 98.75. Period 11 saw a spike to 149, while Period 10 was 80. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is high (~0.95), suggesting we should carry safety stock to avoid stockouts like the one in Period 6. I will use the recent 11 periods to estimate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current demand variability while maintaining the confirmed lead time L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1630.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 13. Recent demand history shows significant volatility, with recent demands being 149 (Period 11) and 90 (Period 12). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 concluded periods. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the base stock level should be high enough to avoid stockouts. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the more recent demand environment better than the full history, encompassing the recent spike and subsequent dip. L remains at the promised default of 0 since no shifts in lead time have been observed.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, and the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded periods. Current on-hand inventory is 71 units with 0 units in transit. The recent demand (last 8 periods since Period 6) averages 102.5 units, compared to the overall average of 93.7 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level should be high (target quantile q \u2248 0.95). I will use a recent demand window of 8 periods to capture the current mean and volatility, setting L=0 as consistently observed.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period it is placed). Demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variance across the last 14 periods, ranging from 18 to 158 units. To set the base stock level, I am using 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=14. This covers all available historical outcomes while filtering out the initial cold-start samples. Since profit ($19.0) is much higher than holding cost ($1.0), the backend will target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N=14 captures the actual fluctuation seen in this specific environment better than the default full-history mean, as it focuses on the relevant operational phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1699.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms that orders arrive within the same period (L=0). Total demand across the first 15 periods is 1233, averaging 82.2 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean demand is slightly lower at 67.0 units, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~50). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level target is high (~95%). Since the inventory at the end of Period 15 is 68 units, which is close to the recent average demand, I will use a conservative approach by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=10) to capture more variability than the last 5 periods while still being more responsive than the full history. This balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3097.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with Period 16 experiencing a significant spike to 182 units, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 16 observed periods. To prevent stockouts during such high-demand periods while considering the $19 profit vs. $1 holding cost ratio (implying a target service level of ~95%), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10. This captures the recent demand fluctuations (including the high of 182 and low of 25) more effectively than the long-term average, ensuring the base stock level adapts to the current variability. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 17 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift based on the provided generic period dates. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 78, 25, 93, 182, 73) gives an average of 90.2, which is close to the long-term average (approx 87.5). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures recent volatility while smoothing out extreme outliers like the 182 in Period 16. With a high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1256.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent periods ranging from 18 units to 182 units. The mean demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 89. demand in the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has been 25, 93, 182, 73, and 71, averaging 88.8, which is consistent with the long-term average. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that all orders have arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There is no specific calendar or product seasonality information provided. Given the high variance (standard deviation around 45-50), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility while maintaining a stable average. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=1) while accounting for the high standard deviation to minimize stockouts (as seen in P6 and P16).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear structural shift or strong seasonality in the first 19 periods. The mean demand over 19 periods is approximately 87 units, while the recent 5-period mean is slightly lower at 93, 182 (capped at 163), 73, 71, 47 (avg ~93). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent variability while smoothing out the very high demand seen in Period 16. Setting L to 'default' matches the promised and observed lead time of 0.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will maintain L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 90 units per period over the last 20 periods. There are no clear seasonal or regime shifts detectable from the 20-period history (Historical samples P1-P5 were: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128; recently demand has ranged from 47 to 182). Period 16 saw a notable spike (182), while Period 14 saw a dip (25). Using recent_N with N=20 provides a broad enough sample to capture this volatility while centering on the current mean. Profit-to-cost ratio is high (19:1), suggesting a high service level is optimal to avoid stockouts like those seen in Period 6 and Period 16. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the underlying demand distribution statistically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2298.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 17-21) has stabilized around a mean of 80 units (73, 71, 47, 86, 123), following some higher volatility earlier in the game. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 21 concluded periods. The 'chips(Regular)' item has high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), justifying a high service level. Given the current on-hand inventory is relatively low (39 units) compared to the average demand, and that lead time is effectively 0, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand level while being responsive to the uptick seen in Period 21 (123 units). The lead time L will remain 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2374.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but shows higher volatility in recent periods (Demand P21=123, P22=125). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. I've set N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior (approximate mean of 92.4 for P13-P22) which includes the recent spikes. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time consistency.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last few periods has been highly volatile (Period 21: 123, Period 22: 125, Period 23: 22). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently maintained, as evidenced by all orders (P1-P23) arriving in the same period they were ordered. Since the inventory position currently stands at 142 units following a very low demand period (22 units), I will use a moderate window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to smooth out the noise while remaining responsive to the recent high-demand spikes seen in P21 and P22.

The average demand across all 24 periods is approximately 89.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 42.4. In the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24), the average demand is slightly lower at 85.4 units, but this is within the normal range of fluctuation. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the optimal service level is high (z* \u2248 1.64 for 95%). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while maintaining a stable average, as the demand appears to be a stationary but noisy process.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 25 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand displays significant volatility but no clear structural regime shift or seasonal trend that violates a stable mean over the long term. The average demand across all 25 periods is approximately 89.9 units, with recent demand (last 10 periods) averaging 82.8 units. I will use the recent 20 periods to capture a broader variance while staying responsive to the overall mean. L is set to 0. Since the profit to holding cost ratio is high (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (around 95%). Parameters are chosen to ensure sufficient stock for the immediate demand resolution phase.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 90 units over the historical period. However, analyzing the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 84.3 units, with significant variability (standard deviation of 33.7). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised, based on the history where all orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To balance the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1), a high service level is desirable. The OR backend uses any provided parameters to set a base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior and local variance, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock that covers the anticipated demand of roughly 85-90 units plus a safety buffer for the next period, especially since 'On-hand' inventory is currently low at 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2098.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with occasional spikes. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 88.0 units, while the full history average is approximately 88.3 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., P27 order arrived in P27). Since there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals in the provided 'Period_X' dates, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture current volatility while remaining responsive to the average. The current on-hand inventory is 30, and there are no units in transit. Setting L=0 ensures the OR backend targets enough stock for the current period's demand. I'll use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1853.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without clear seasonal trends or regime shifts over the past 28 periods. The mean demand across all provided history is approximately 92.2 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 42.6. In the most recent 10-period window (Periods 19-28), the mean demand is slightly lower at 90.6, while the 5-period window (Periods 24-28) is slightly higher at 102.6. Given the absence of a distinct sustained trend above historical norms, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current demand mean and volatility while smoothing out very short-term noise. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrivals, which I will continue to utilize via the 'default' method. This strategy maintains a high service level while managing holding costs based on the most recent behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1990.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 20 periods with a mean of approx 94 units and a standard deviation of 37 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods as observed in all concluding messages. In Period 29, demand was 107 units, and current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Since demand occurs after the order arrival in a lead time = 0 scenario, and the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to calculate a base-stock level (Target Inventory = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302), I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current demand regime. The 'recent_N' method for N=20 accurately reflects the mean demand (~94) and volatility needed for the OR engine to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase in both stability and average volume. Comparing the last 10 periods (Periods 21-30) to the earlier history, the mean demand has risen to approximately 101 units per period, up from the overall historical mean of approximately 88 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%, the priority is ensuring sufficient on-hand inventory to meet this demand spike while maintaining efficient stock levels. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this elevated demand regime and ensure the OR backend reacts to the current trend rather than the lowerhistorical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 25: Average demand increased from ~85 to ~110 (+29%) over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2766.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 25. The most recent demand was 146, and the average since the regime shift at P25 is 116.4. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P25-P31) to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining a responsive forecast. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (8 units), requiring an order that adequately covers the upcoming demand surge and target base stock. Setting sigma_hat to the recent period volatility will ensure a buffer against the increased variance observed in this higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 further confirmed: avg demand increased from ~85 to ~116 (+36%) over the last 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2679.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend starting from Period 25. The last 8 periods (P25-P32) have an average demand of approximately 124.75 units (110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183), compared to the earlier historical average of ~85. The most recent demand was 183, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To capture this shift and ensure sufficient stock for the next period, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=8, targeting the regime that began at Period 25. This focuses the OR backend on the current higher-demand environment, mitigating the risk of further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: average demand increased from ~85 to ~125 (+47%) over the last 8 periods (P25-P32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1470.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the mean demand was approximately 83 units. From Period 25 to Period 33, demand has increased to an average of about 120 units (110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183, 82). While Period 33 showed a slight dip (82), the overall trend remains elevated compared to the early history. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and the associated volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will use the default method for L to maintain responsiveness. The goal is to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to handle a mean of ~120 units per period while accounting for the high volatility seen in Period 32 (183).

Daily Reward (R_t): $451.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a higher mean since Period 25. While the carry-over insights flagged an average increase to ~125 between P25-P32, recent demand in P33 (82) and P34 (31) has been lower, suggesting high volatility or a potential cooling of that peak. However, looking at the regime since Period 25 (P25-P34), the average demand is approximately 111.1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current regime (P25 to P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as 10 periods accurately reflect the shift while accounting for the recent low-demand variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as seen in all concluded messages, so I will stick with 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1144.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand peak (P25-P32) has subsided significantly over the last three periods (P33-P35), with demand dropping to 82, 31, and 66 units respectively. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is approximately 101.6, which is lower than the ~125 mean observed during the peak but higher than the pre-peak baseline of ~83. Given the variability, I will use recent_N with N=11 to encompass the shift and the subsequent cooling period (P25-P35), providing a balanced forecast for the OR backend. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak (P25-P32) has ended; demand in P33-P35 (mean 60) indicates a cooling trend compared to the previous regime.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility recently. While a cooling trend was noted in Periods 33-35 (averaging 60), Period 36 saw a significant spike to 166. This suggests that the 'cooling trend' may have been a temporary lull rather than a sustained regime shift, or that the variance is significantly higher than previously estimated. The average demand from Period 25 to 36 is approximately 112.5. Given the stock-out risk seen in Period 32 and the high demand in Period 36, I will use a recent window (N=12, covering the start of the higher-demand period at P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand peaks (183, 166) with the lower lulls (31, 66). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high post-Period 25: regime mean is ~112 but includes swings from 31 to 183 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with intermittent spikes. Period 36 saw a significant jump to 166 units, followed by 114 units in Period 37. While Carry-over Insights from P36 suggested a 'cooling trend', the last two periods (mean=140) suggest the high-demand regime from P25-P32 (mean ~125) might still be active or manifesting in clusters. Current on-hand inventory is 67. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting actual lead time, so L=default. To capture the recent high volatility and the potential return to higher demand levels while protecting against stockouts (since profit/holding ratio is high at 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13. This window covers the start of the major demand shift (Period 25 to Period 37), ensuring the OR backend accounts for the higher mean (~112) and the substantial standard deviation (~45) observed during this volatile phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Periods 36-37 (mean 140) contradict the cooling trend suggested in P36, indicating the P25 regime of high, volatile demand persists.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that started at Period 25. Recent demand in Period 38 was lower (59 units) following a moderate-to-high demand sequence (166 and 114 in P36-P37). The Carry-over Insights correctly identify that the 'cooling trend' initially suspected in P36 was premature, and we remain in a high-variance environment. I will use recent_N with N=14 (from P25 to P38) to capture the full scope of this current volatile regime while ignoring the lower-demand baseline from early periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. Using N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend accounts for both the increased mean and the high standard deviation observed since P25, maintaining a high service level to prevent stockouts during large demand swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1184.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. While Periods 33-35 suggested a cooling trend, Periods 36-39 have shown a mix of high (166, 114) and moderate (59, 68) demand, maintaining a high mean and significant variance. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 40, I am setting L to 'default' (0). To capture the current volatile regime starting from Period 25, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 (covering Periods 25-39). This N captures the full extent of the current regime's behavior, balancing the older high-demand peaks with the more recent moderate observations to provide a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1067.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Since the major regime shift at Period 25, the demand has fluctuated between 31 and 183 units. Recent demand (P38-P40) has averaged approximately 63 units, which is lower than the long-term average post-P25 (approx 105) but fits within the observed high-variance pattern. On-hand inventory is currently 111 units, providing a reasonable buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the high volatility (risk of stockout) with the current ending inventory, I will use a window of the last 16 periods (P25 to P40) to capture the full range of this 'high volatility' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=16 ensures we include the extreme highs and lows observed recently, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3230.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 41 spiked to 184 units, a repeat of the peak seen in Period 32 (183 units). This confirms that while the 'average' demand has shifted since Period 25, the volatility is the primary driver of stockouts (Ending Inventory is 0). Historical data since Period 25 shows a wide demand range (31 to 184). For Period 42, I am using recent_N (N=17, covering the regime since P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-mean regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all 'conclude' messages. By focusing on the regime since P25, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean (~110-120) and the significant standard deviation, maintaining a high service level for the $19 profit margin against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor since P25, with frequent spikes near 185 units and lows near 30 units across the last 17 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean since Period 25. The most recent demand (Period 42) was 113, following a peak of 184 in Period 41. Across the last 18 periods (P25-P42), the mean demand is approximately 106 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-P25 average of approximately 85. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to capture these frequent demand spikes (reaching up to 184 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=18 to cover the entire current regime since Period 25, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects both the elevated average demand and the substantial variance observed recently.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 25. While the promised lead time remains 0, the recent history shows extreme demand swings, with a high of 184 and a low of 44 in the last three periods. The long-term mean since P25 is approximately 104, but the 'cooling' periods are frequently interrupted by significant spikes. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the critical priority is avoiding stockouts during these spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P25 onwards) to capture this higher mean while ensuring the OR engine's service-level logic accounts for the high standard deviation (sigma_hat) to protect against the volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0 as per consistent arrival observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1082.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 25 has been characterized by high volatility and a higher mean compared to the initial periods. The recent history (P33-P44) shows a mean demand of approximately 93 units with extreme swings (min 31, max 184). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0, the backend's base stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) essentially targets current period demand coverage. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.95, resulting in a high safety factor (z \u2248 1.64). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using the last 12 periods (P33-P44) to capture the current volatile regime. This 12-period window (N=12) balances the need to reflect recent variability while smoothing out individual spikes. \u03c3\u0302 will also be calculated over these 12 periods to provide an appropriate safety stock cushion against the observed frequent demand spikes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been characterized by high volatility since Period 25. Recent demand in Period 45 was 114 units, aligning with the sustained high-regime average observed in recent periods. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. For Period 46, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the demand regime post-Period 25, which averages approximately 104 units per period. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~48) seen in this period range. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level, which is appropriate for this level of volatility to avoid stockouts like those seen in Periods 32, 36, and 41.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the high-volatility regime established since Period 25. The recent demand (P41-P46) has seen significant swings: 184, 113, 44, 63, 114, 148. The mean demand for this specific 6-period recent segment is approximately 114.3. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the current volatile regime (starting P25) while ignoring the lower-demand pre-P25 data. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers these frequent large spikes (up to 184 units) without being over-influenced by the early game behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2561.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-volatility regime since Period 25. Recent demand in Periods 45-47 (114, 148, 137) confirms that the average remains elevated, near the ~112-125 range identified in previous insights. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history (order and arrival in the same period). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current high-volatility regime starting from P25 (current period is 48, so 48-25 = 23 samples available). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the significant variance observed in this period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in the wide range of demand values from 44 to 148 in the last 10 periods. The trend identified since Period 25 persists, within which the mean demand fluctuates significantly between 'bursts'. Recent demand (Periods 42-48) shows an average of approximately 95 units, though volatility remains the defining characteristic. Period 49 is the penultimate period; therefore, the goal is to maintain sufficient stock for the remaining demand while avoiding excessive leftover inventory at the end of Period 50 to minimize holding costs. Given a lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), I am using a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current mean and high volatility of the P25 regime. This N=10 window provides a stable estimate of the recent demand average (~95.4) and standard deviation (~44.8) to navigate the remaining two periods without Stocking Out.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1544.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established around Period 25. Recent demand (P43-P49) has been 44, 63, 114, 148, 137, 67, and 86, yielding a mean of approximately 94 units. However, looking at the broader window since P42 (the last carry-over update), the mean is closer to 100 with significant spikes. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages (e.g., P49 order arrived P49). I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance, elevated demand level while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (95th percentile), which is appropriate given the frequent spikes above 140 units.
