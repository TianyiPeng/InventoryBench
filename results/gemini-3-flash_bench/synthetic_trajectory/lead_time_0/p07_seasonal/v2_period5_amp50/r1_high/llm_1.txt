  "rationale": "This is Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), I need to order enough to satisfy the expected demand for the current period immediately. Looking at the provided historical demand data (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean demand is approximately 102 units. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a stock-out is much more expensive than holding extra inventory. I will target the upper end of the historical range to ensure a high service level while I establish the actual demand regime and lead time behavior. I'll start with an order of 130 units which covers the mean plus a small safety buffer.",

Mean demand is approximately 100 units/period. However, variance is high (standard deviation ~40).

Lead Time: Concluded history (P1 to P7) consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods (same-day arrival). 4. Inventory/Pipeline: Current on-hand is 26. In-transit is 0. 5.
