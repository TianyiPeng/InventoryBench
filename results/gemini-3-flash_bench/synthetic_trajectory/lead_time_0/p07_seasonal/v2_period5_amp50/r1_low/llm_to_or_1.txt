Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period arrival. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). The mean of these 5 samples is 102 units and the standard deviation is approximately 34.3. Given the Lead Time (L) is 0, the reviewing period + lead time is (0+1) = 1 period. I will use the 'default' methods to initialize the OR parameters, which will calculate the mean and standard deviation from the available historical samples for this first decision phase. Since there's no evidence yet of lead time drift or demand regime shifts, current historical data is the best starting point.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 102 units based on a base-stock calculation. Period 1 documentation shows that 'lead_time was 0 periods', meaning the order arrived in the same period (Scenario B). However, demand was 126, which exceeded our supply (102 units), resulting in 24 units of lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. Historical demand samples (Period 1-5) are: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128. The mean of these 5 samples is 102. Since lead time L=0 is confirmed, the review cycle is (L+1) = 1 period. We need to set parameters to cover the current period's demand. Given profit $1.0 and holding cost $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. With high volatility (std dev approx 37), we should maintain a base stock that accounts for this. I will use 'recent_5' to capture the known historical distribution mean (~102) and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). However, in both periods, demand (126 and 119) exceeded the quantity ordered/on-hand (102 and 100), leading to stockouts and lost profit. The current mean demand based on historical samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) is ~102, but the most recent realized demands in the game (126, 119) are higher than the initial samples. I will set the base stock logic to better cover this higher demand. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the representative volatility while acknowledging the recent high demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to remain reactive to the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of high demand volatility and stockouts in the first two periods. Demand for the first three periods was 126, 119, and 51 respectively. The prompt highlights historical samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), which align somewhat with the observed demand but suggest higher potential spikes. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals so far have been instantaneous (lead_time 0). However, because holding costs ($1.0) and profit ($1.0) are equal (q = 0.5), the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median demand. With on-hand inventory at 55 and the most recent demand being 51, we need to ensure enough stock for potential recovery to earlier high demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the recent range and set L to default (0).

Daily Profit: $18.00, Daily Holding Cost: $81.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility (126, 119, 51, 18), suggesting a potential downward trend or shift in demand regime after Period 2. The mean demand of the first two periods (122.5) is much higher than the last two periods (34.5). Given this drastic drop, using all samples would over-order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent lower-demand regime while still allowing for some variance. With L=0, the base stock only needs to cover the current period's demand (1+0 periods). Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) result in a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median (50th percentile) of the demand distribution.

Daily Profit: $81.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been 126, 119, 51, 18, and 84 (Mean: 79.6). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms L=0 (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived same-period). In Period 5, no order was placed because on-hand inventory (81) was deemed sufficient by the OR backend, but demand (84) slightly exceeded this, leaving us with 0 on-hand. There are no units in-transit. Given the high demand variability (std dev ~45), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history. This will set the base stock level to cover the expected demand for the current period (L+1=1) plus a safety stock buffer dictated by the noise in the first 5 periods. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand unless adjusted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). The inventory is currently 0. Looking at the demand history, we see a mean demand of approximately 101 units (137, 92, 110, 43, 128, and recent observed demands of 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158). The demand is quite volatile (std dev ~45). In Period 6, demand spiked to 158, leading to a stockout. To recover and maintain service level (profit $1, holding $1 implies a 50% critical ratio, but we want to avoid stockouts), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent high volatility and demand recovery. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively targets one period of demand. I'll use default for insurance on variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-4, 6-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Demand has been volatile: initial periods (P1-P2) averaged ~120, followed by a dip in P3-P4, and a recent spike in P6-P7 averaging 146. To prevent stockouts seen in the last two periods where sales were limited by supply, I am increasing the forecast using the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) which includes the recent demand surge. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, resulting in a target service level of 50%, meaning the OR backend will aim for the mean demand. By using recent_N for both mean and sigma, I allow the system to adapt to the recent higher volume and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 71. Historical demand for the last 8 periods has shown significant volatility (range: 18-158) with a mean of approximately 105. Since Period 5, demand has been particularly high (mean of 107.75 for P5-P8), though the most recent period saw a dip to 55. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arriving the same period ordered). I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand and sigma calculations to capture the current high-volatility regime while smoothing out the most recent outlier. L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows significant volatility: Period 1: 126, Period 2: 119, Period 3: 51, Period 4: 18, Period 5: 84, Period 6: 158, Period 7: 134, Period 8: 55, Period 9: 72. The mean demand across all 9 observed periods is approximately 90.7 units, with a standard deviation around 45. There is no clear seasonal or calendar-based driver mentioned, but demand exhibits a cyclical or high-variance pattern. Because the profit per unit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The OR backend will target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 18. Given the high variance and the fact that we have run out of stock in 5 out of 9 periods, I will use all available history to capture the full volatility in the sigma_hat calculation but use a recent_N (N=5) for the mean to stay responsive to the more recent demand levels (Avg P5-P9 = 100.6).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is consistently observed across all concluding periods (P1-P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no clear sustained regime shift. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. Given the recent demand history (P1: 126, P2: 119, P3: 51, P4: 18, P5: 84, P6: 158, P7: 134, P8: 55, P9: 72, P10: 80), the demand fluctuates significantly. Using the recent 5 periods (P6-P10) balances the high demand spikes with more moderate recent levels. On-hand inventory is 21 units with 0 in-transit. Setting L=0 (explicit/default) and focusing on recent_N for mu and sigma will allow the backend to adjust the base stock to current volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.5. This means the OR engine targets the median demand to balance stockout and holding costs. Demand history shows significant volatility: P1-P5 (126, 119, 51, 18, 84; mean=79.6) and P6-P11 (158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149; mean=108). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 0. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent, higher demand regime (avg ~108) while accounting for the high variance (std ~42). L remains at the promised 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 18 units with no items in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable but volatile pattern with a mean of approximately 88.75 units over the last 12 periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full recent demand history while filtering out the initial seed data. This approach ensures our base stock level covers the expected demand for the current period (the lead+review time of 1 period) while maintaining a buffer for observed volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true for all 13 periods. Inventory levels are low (17 units on-hand), and historical demand shows significant variability, ranging from a low of 18 (P4) to a high of 158 (P6). Recent demand has stabilized somewhat compared to the early periods, but still exhibits standard variation for a grocery product like chips. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$1, Holding=$1, q=0.5), the OR engine will naturally target the median demand (z=0). Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for a single period (1+0). I will use the last 8 periods (P6 to P13) to capture the current demand regime, which centers around a mean of approximately 102 units. This N=8 choice filters out the very low demand outlier in Period 4 and Period 5 while maintaining enough samples for a robust estimation.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed in all 14 concluded periods. Demand has shown high variability but no distinct structural shift. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 90, 78, 25) averages 64.3, while the overall mean since Period 1 is 88.5. Given the high stock-out frequency in early periods (P1, P2, P6, P7, P11), the OR backend needs a safety buffer. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg of 149, 90, 78, 25 + current observed P14 demand), providing a slightly more responsive forecast than the long-term average. Sigma_hat will use the default method to maintain a robust estimate of volatility over the entire history, ensuring sufficient coverage against spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but relatively stable mean behavior over the last 15 periods. Recent demand in Period 15 was 93, following a low of 25 in Period 14. Looking at the history, the average demand is approximately 89 units per period (sum of demand P1-P15 is 1333 / 15 = 88.87). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00 each), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing out the extreme fluctuations observed in Periods 11 (149) and 14 (25). L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory for chips(Regular) is currently 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility, with recent periods (P11-P16) range from 25 to 182. Specifically, Period 16 saw a spike to 182 units, leading to a stockout. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. However, given the frequent stockouts observed (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7, P11, P15, P16), the backend's capped policy tends to under-order when historical variance is high and lead time is zero. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P7-P16) to capture the current demand mean (~90) and variance, which better reflects the alternating high/low demand cycle than the full history. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 17 completed periods. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a Profit of $1.0 and a Holding Cost of $1.0, implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.50. This means the OR engine will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand over the (L+1) period (which is 1 period here). Historical demand fluctuates significantly without a clear seasonal trend, showing a mix of high demand (e.g., P16: 182) and low demand (e.g., P4: 18). Given the high volatility and equal reward/cost weight, using the full historical average helps stabilize the ordering pattern. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data (Periods 1-17 plus the initial 5 samples) to calculate a representative average and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 18 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with no clear seasonal trend identifiable from the generic period numbering. Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) plus the 18 periods of game history show a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units with a standard deviation of about 45 units. The most recent demand (Period 18) was 71 units, following values of 73 and 182. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level q is 0.5 (\u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0). This means the base stock should ideally be the mean demand for the (L+1) period (which is 1 period since L=0). I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and volume while filtering out the older regime, as demand appears quite noisy but centered around 90-100 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product chips(Regular) has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, resulting in a target service level of 50% (z*=0). This means the OR backend should target the mean demand (mu_hat) for a base stock policy. Historical data shows consistent 0-period lead times across all 19 completed periods. Demand has shown significant volatility throughout the game (ranges from 18 to 182). Recent history (last 5-10 periods) shows demand fluctuating around a mean of approximately 92. I will use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while ignoring the earliest startup phase, ensuring the base stock stays aligned with recent consumption patterns. Lead time L is set to 'default' as 0-period delivery is stable.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 20 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but a relatively stable mean. The observed demand for Periods 1-20 are: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55, 72, 80, 149, 90, 78, 25, 93, 182, 73, 71, 47, 86. The mean of this historical demand is approximately 89.5 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. For Period 21, the starting on-hand inventory is 3, with 0 units in transit. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Given the high variance (standard deviation approx 43.6), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture more recent demand fluctuations without being overly reactive to single-period spikes, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current pace of about 90 units/period (review+lead total).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) fluctuates between 18 and 182 units throughout the 21 periods. By looking at all historical data, the mean is 91.5 and the standard deviation is 44.2. Recent demand (Periods 19-21: 47, 86, 123) averages around 85 units, but the high variance suggests we should maintain a robust safety stock, especially since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's default logic z-score will reflect this balance. The lead time has consistently been 0. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current variability while maintaining enough data points to smooth out the noise.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility but maintains a relatively stable mean around 90-100 units per period. In recent periods (21 and 22), demand was 123 and 125 units, leading to stockouts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching back to Period 1. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median of the demand distribution. To prevent stockouts seen in the last two periods, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture current demand levels while smoothing out noise, and default for sigma_hat to account for historical variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility, with the most recent Period 23 dropping significantly to 22 units from a series of high-demand periods (123, 125). Looking at the history, demand oscillates between high spikes (149, 182) and low troughs (18, 25, 22). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. As of Period 24, we have 69 units on hand. The average demand across all periods (including seed and history) is approximately 91. Given the high variance and equal profit/holding cost (Z-score for 50% service level is 0), the OR backend's default base_stock calculation will target the mean. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand density while smoothing the recent outlier, and recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the second half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a fluctuating pattern with an average around 88-90 units over the last 24 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has been slightly higher, averaging 85 units but with some stockouts in periods 21 and 22 indicating missed demand (sold=initial inventory). Historical lead time consistently shows 0 periods. Since lead time is 0, orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize both stockouts (profit loss) and holding costs (equal at $1.0 each), a base stock policy using a recent demand average is appropriate. I will use the last 20 periods to capture the general mean while smoothing out individual spikes like the 182 in P16 or the 22 in P23. Setting L=0 ensures we attempt to handle current period demand with current period orders.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but relatively stable mean behavior over the long term. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. In the most recent period (P25), we stocked out despite an order of 77 units because demand (110) exceeded total availability (91). To determine OR parameters, I'm using a 20-period lookback (recent_N=20) to capture the current demand regime, which includes several spikes and dips (Min: 18, Max: 182). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. Since we frequently stock out (e.g., periods 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25), the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help provide a base stock that better reflects recent variability compared to the full history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits high volatility, with a mean around 90-100 units. Period 25 and 26 show demand exceeding on-hand inventory (Demand: 110, 120), leading to stockouts. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. To better capture the recent variability and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock that minimizes stockouts while balancing holding costs (profit $1, holding cost $1, implying a 50% service level target in a simple newsboy calculation, but the backend uses a base-stock model), I will use the last 15 periods to calculate demand statistics. This captures recent demand levels (which seem slightly higher than the initial periods) while providing enough samples to estimate variance. Setting L to 0 explicitly aligns with the consistent observation of same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following several periods of stockouts (Periods 25, 26, 27). This indicates that the OR backend's internal 'cap' based on historical data is insufficient to meet recent demand spikes. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Demand analysis: Demand has been volatile but shows recent highs (P25: 110, P26: 120, P27: 112). The mean demand across the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 89.9, while the mean of the entire history (P1-P27) is closer to 85. However, because our profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q = 1 / (1 + 1)) is exactly 50%. The current 'base_stock' logic is failing because mean-based ordering without a safety factor (due to q=0.5) cannot handle demand variance when lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat with a value of 45 to force a higher base stock (target ~135 units), which better covers the peak demand observed (182 in P16, ~120 recently) and prevents frequent stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase. Over the last three periods (P26-P28), demand has been consistently at or above 100 units (120, 112, 100), compared to the overall mean of approximately 89.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this slightly elevated demand regime while maintaining stability. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is confirmed by every concluded period in the history. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we need to order enough to cover the current period's demand. By using the 'calculate' method for L (which will evaluate to 0) and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma, I ensure the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for recent volatility and mean demand, minimizing lost sales while acknowledging the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 25: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~105 across the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly entered a new regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the actual demand values were 110, 120, 112, 100, and 107, yielding an average of 109.8 units. This is significantly higher than the earlier historical average (approx. 85). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated demand level and its associated volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-period lead time. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand peak while maintaining a service level balanced against the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~110 (+29%) based on 5 consecutive periods of data (P25-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 25 is now clearly established over the last 6 periods (P25-P30). The mean demand during this recent window is approximately 111.5 (SD ~7.5), significantly higher than the long-term average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the service level targeted by the backend OR logic using the critical fractile is 50%, meaning the base stock will be roughly the mean over the lead+review period (1+0=1 period). I will use a N=6 period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet these higher levels, as we have been consistently stocking out.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~111 (+30%) based on 6 consecutive periods (P25-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a sustained upward shift starting at Period 25. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), the mean demand has increased to approximately 116 units, compared to the earlier average of ~85. The most recent demand (P31) was significantly higher at 146 units, suggesting that the regime shift is not just sustained but potentially still intensifying. To capture this recent high-demand trend while maintaining stability, I will use a N=7 window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that better reflects the current higher demand level and its associated volatility, helping to reduce the stockouts observed in the last several periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~116 (+36%) based on 7 consecutive periods (P25-P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 25 is confirmed and accelerating. Mean demand from Period 1-24 was approximately 86, but from Period 25-32 it has increased significantly (P25: 110, P26: 120, P27: 112, P28: 100, P29: 107, P30: 120, P31: 146, P32: 183). The average of these last 8 periods is ~125, but the last two periods show a sharp spike (146, 183). Inventory is currently at 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for this sharp upward trend and prevent stockouts, I am using recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift since P25. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current higher demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~86 to ~125 (+45%) across 8 periods (P25-P32), with last 2 periods exceeding 140 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 25. Prior to P25, mean demand was approximately 86. From P25 to P33 (9 periods), the mean demand increased to approximately 120.0, with a recent peak of 183 in P32. Although P33 recorded a lower demand of 82, this is consistent with the volatility observed in this SKU. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent conclude messages. To capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out the most recent lower observation, I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P25-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher average demand and the increased volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~86 to ~120 (+40%) across 9 periods (P25-P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 25. Prior to this, demand averaged approximately 86 units. From Period 25 to 34, the average demand increased to approximately 111 units, although the most recent two periods (P33 and P34) showed a sharp decline (82 and 31 units respectively). Despite the recent drop, the overall trend since P25 remains higher than the historical baseline. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=10 to encompass the entire elevated regime (P25-P34) to calculate mu_hat, balancing the recent spikes with the latest pull-back. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this same 10-period window to capture the increased volatility (ranging from 31 to 183). Lead time L is consistently 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the mean demand was approximately 80-85 units. From Period 25 to Period 32, demand surged, peaking at 183 units in Period 32. However, the last three periods (P33-P35) have shown a cooling trend with demand values of 82, 31, and 66. This suggests either a return to the previous mean or a stabilization at a higher volatility. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align with the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the entire period since the shift began (P25-P35), which balances the high-demand peak with the recent lower values. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period (lead_time 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 25; recent demand (P33-P35) suggests the high-growth phase may be plateuing or reverting toward a mean of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and mean shifts since Period 25. While Periods 25-32 showed a strong upward trend (mean ~135), Periods 33-36 have fluctuated wildly (82, 31, 66, 166). The mean demand for the entire high-demand regime (P25-P36) is approximately 117, but the most recent 12 periods demonstrate a high standard deviation. In Period 36, demand spiked to 166, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (order and arrival in the same period), I will maintain L=0. To capture the current high-demand, high-volatility environment while slightly smoothing recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach with N=12 (covering the entire regime since Period 25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher average demand and the increased risk of stockouts due to high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high post-Period 25; Period 36 spike (166) following several low-demand periods confirms a high-variance, high-mean regime (Avg ~117 since P25).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' confirms a sustained regime shift that began around Period 25. Since Period 25 (13 observations), the mean demand has increased to approximately 116 units per period, compared to the pre-P25 average of ~85. However, volatility is high, with recent demands ranging from 31 to 166. In the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the average is approximately 92, but this includes a massive spike of 166 (P36) and two very low periods (31, 66). Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order to cover the next period's expected demand. I will use the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) to capture the higher mean and variance of this current regime (P25-P37), as this provides the best balance between responsiveness to the shift and smoothing recent extreme volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-variance regime since Period 25. Recent demand reflects significant volatility (Period 36: 166, Period 38: 59). Despite the lower demand in Period 38 (59), the average since Period 25 remains approximately 112. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Operating with a 50/50 profit-to-holding cost ratio ($1:$1) implies a target cycle service level of 0.50 (the base stock should roughly equal the median demand). Using the last 14 periods (P25-P38) to capture the current regime, the mean demand is 112.5 and standard deviation is 42.9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR backend's capped policy doesn't over-order due to the high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the mean demand was approximately 86. From Period 25 to Period 39 (15 periods), the mean demand increased to approximately 107.8 with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 41.5). The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show demand of 66, 166, 114, 59, and 68, maintaining this high-variance characteristic. Although the last few periods suggest a possible softening or continued high volatility, I will use a recent window of N=15 (starting from the shift at P25) to capture this new regime. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. The OR engine will use these parameters to set a base stock that accounts for the high demand variance while balancing the equal costs of lost sales ($1.0) and inventory holding ($1.0), aiming for a 50% service level which is optimal when profit equals holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 25. Prior to P25, mean demand was approximately 85. Since P25, demand has become much more volatile with a higher mean of approximately 107 (P25-P40 average). Recent demand (P36-P40) has been 166, 114, 59, 68, 62, averaging 93.8, while the 10-period average (P31-P40) is 109.9. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N (lead_time was 0 periods), with no missed shipments. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=16 (back to the start of the regime shift at P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-variance environment while reflecting the full extent of the known regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-mean regime established around Period 25. In Period 41, demand spiked to 184 units, mirroring previous spikes in Period 32 (183) and Period 36 (166). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the high volatility (standard deviation remains high) and the recent spike, I will use recent_N=17 (covering P25 to P41) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the potential for these recurring large spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost. Setting L to 'default' as promised lead time (0) is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift since Period 25, characterized by both a higher mean (averaging ~110-115) and significantly higher volatility (spikes up to 184). In the most recent periods (P41-P42), demand was 184 and 113. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the high demand in P42 exceeding the previous order. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival), the goal is to set a base stock level that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for this high variance. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the older, lower-demand data from before Period 25. This balances the profit margin ($1.0) against the holding cost ($1.0), aiming for a 50% service level modified by the OR backend's safety stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 25; recent demand (P41-P42) confirms the sustained high-mean, high-variance regime with a mean demand around 110-115 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 25. While the promised lead time remains 0, recent demand (P25-P43) shows a higher mean and increased volatility. Specifically, the mean demand since P25 is approximately 107 units per period, but the standard deviation has risen significantly due to spikes (e.g., 184 in P41, 166 in P36) and troughs (44 in P43). Given the current on-hand inventory of 51 and the 0-period lead time, I will use recent_N (N=19, covering the entire new regime) to capture this shifted distribution for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the higher average demand and the increased risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (service level optimization).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-mean, high-variance regime that began around Period 25. Recent demand (P41-P44) has shown significant volatility, ranging from 44 to 184 units, reinforcing the need for a larger buffer to mitigate frequent stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from P1 to P44 arriving in the same period they were placed. Since the current regime (P25-P44) is now 20 periods long, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this specific regime. This approach aligns with the Carry-Over Insights and provides a balanced statistic that accounts for both recent spikes (184 in P41) and drops (44 in P43). Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the inferred lead time (0).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 to a higher mean (~105-115) and significantly higher volatility. Reviewing the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is approximately 110.7 with a standard deviation around 48.7. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With profit=$1 and holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0), suggesting the base stock should target the median/mean. However, given the high volatility and frequent stockouts (sold < demand in P41, P42, P45), a slightly more responsive approach (EWMA) or a N-period window that captures this volatility is preferred. I will use recent_N with N=21 to cover the entire high-volatility regime starting from Period 25 (P25 to P45 is 21 samples) to provide the OR backend with a robust estimate of the current variance and mean.

Demand since Period 25 has entered a high-mean, high-variance regime. The average demand from Period 25 to 46 is approximately 107 units per period, but volatility is very high with several spikes exceeding 160. To maintain a high service level while meeting the current demand regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (capturing the regime since P25-P27) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects both the elevated mean and the significant variance observed in the latter half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit the high-mean, high-variance regime identified at Period 25. Recent demand in Periods 45-47 (114, 148, 137) confirms a sustained average around 110-120 units. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit, as lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Data for the post-Period 25 regime (Periods 25-47) provides 23 samples, which is sufficient for a reliable estimation. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's volatility and mean while allowing for slight smoothing. With profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target a base stock near the median (z=0). My parameters are designed to ensure stock is available for the high-end of this demand range given the absence of safety stock at a 0.5 service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units. Since Period 25, we have observed a sustained higher demand regime (mean ~110-115) with high variance. Recent demand (P45-P48: 114, 148, 137, 67) averages 116.5, which aligns with the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a recent window of N=24 (P25 to P48) to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime while filtering out the lower demand from the first half of the game. For L, 'calculate' is used as actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final period of visibility. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a high-mean, high-variance regime since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 41 to Period 49 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 106 and the standard deviation remains high. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. For this final period, I will set L to 0 using the default (promised). I will use the last 9 samples (the post-Period 40 high-variance cluster) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the current demand level of ~100-110 units while accounting for the significant volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., spikes to 184 and drops to 44). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, essentially aiming for the mean demand to minimize the total expected cost for the final period.
