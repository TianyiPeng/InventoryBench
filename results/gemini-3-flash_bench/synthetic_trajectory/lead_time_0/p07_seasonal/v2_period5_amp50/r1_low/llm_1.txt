Given the extreme drop (126 -> 18), I will order a small amount to hedge against a slight recovery while minimizing holding costs (which are high at $1/unit).

Since holding cost is high, I should not over-order excessively.

To maximize reward while balancing holding costs ($1) against profit ($1), I need to cover the expected demand plus a safety margin for peaks (around 140-160).
