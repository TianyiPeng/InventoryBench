  Samples: [('Period_1', 137), ('Period_2', 92), ('Period_3', 110), ('Period_4', 43), ('Period_5', 128)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As it is Period 1, there is no historical lead time or arrival data to analyze. The promised lead time is 0. Demand for the first 5 periods is provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), with an average of 102 units. Since on-hand inventory starts at 0, I need to place an order immediately. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the backend will calculate base stock for 1 period (L+1). Given the demand volatility shown (range 43-137), I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all 5 provided historical samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This will set a base stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost using the inventory engine's critical ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 125 units, which is significantly higher than the initial seed data average (~102). The order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. Currently, we have 9 units on hand and 0 in transit. To avoid a stockout in Period 2, we need to order enough to cover the expected demand. Given the small number of samples, I will use all 6 available data points (5 from history + 1 from Period 1) to estimate demand. The mean of {137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 125} is 105.8. Since L=0, mu_hat should target (1+0) * mean. Using 'default' will calculate the mean across all 6 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, looking at historical data (P1: 125, P2: 135), the demand is significantly higher than the initial seed data provided in the prompt (Avg of 5 periods was ~101). The actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for both completed cycles (P1 and P2). Since inventory is currently at 0 and demand is slightly increasing, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the higher recent demand (average 130) compared to the global average. With a lead time of 0, the target stock must cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the 0-period lead time trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 125, 135, and 78 for the first three periods respectively (mean = 112.6, std = 30.4). Currently, we have 58 units on hand and 0 in transit. Since L=0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). The base stock calculation by the OR backend will be based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the variability and small sample size, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 94 units on hand with no units currently in transit. Looking at the history (Periods 1-4), the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been quite volatile (125, 135, 78, 45), showing a downward trend in the last two periods. The average demand across all periods is approximately 102 units, but the mean of the first 5 samples provided in the context (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) is about 102 as well. Given the recent drop in demand during Period 3 and 4, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most recent behavior while still accounting for earlier higher demand. Since L=0, mu_hat represents demand for 1 period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect the observed variability in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first five periods, we have observed a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a significant shift after the first two periods: Period 1 and 2 saw demands of 125 and 135, while Periods 3 through 5 saw 78, 45, and 90. The average demand across all periods is 94.6, but the most recent three periods average 71. Given the volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 36.45) and the recent downward shift, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed variability. This approach balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1) by targeting a service level influenced by recent consumption patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked significantly to 163, compared to a historical average around 102. This resulted in a stockout (sold 91, missed 72 units of demand). All orders from P1-P6 have arrived with 0 lead time, confirming L=0 is currently accurate. While demand in P1-P5 was relatively stable (avg 94.6), P6 suggests a possible upward shift or high volatility. Given the stockout and the spike, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand signals while smoothing the single outlier. The OR backend needs to replenish inventory quickly to avoid another stockout, so L=0 and mu_hat adjusted for recent performance is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history from Periods 1-7, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows considerable volatility (range: 43 to 163). In the most recent periods (P6 and P7), demand spiked to 163 and 140 respectively, significantly higher than the initial samples (P4 demand was 45). Period 6 resulted in a stockout (sold 91 out of 163 demand). To address this, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining L=0. With profit=$4 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a service level sufficient to cover most demand spikes. We currently have only 2 units on hand and 0 in transit, necessitating a substantial order this period to prevent another stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 8 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (8/8 observations), aligning with the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a mean of 104.3 and a standard deviation of 42.6. Checking for regime shifts: the last 3 periods (P6-P8) average 120.6, while the 5 periods before (P1-P5) average 94.6. However, P6 was very high (163) and P8 was relatively low (59), suggesting high volatility rather than a clear sustained shift. Given the volatility (coefficient of variation of ~0.4), I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the more current demand behavior more heavily (avg of last 5 is 99.4) while maintaining enough data points to capture the variance. With L=0, the target base stock will be roughly mu + 1.28*sigma to cover the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 82 units. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders from Period 1 to 9 arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand has shown significant variability over the last 9 periods: [125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59, 61]. The mean of all 9 periods is approximately 100, while the mean of the most recent 4 periods (P6-P9) is 105.75. Given the high volatility (sigma is high relative to the mean), a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the current demand state while smoothing some noise. I will use N=9 to capture the full recent history after the initial pre-game samples, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, just high variance around a mean of roughly 100. L is set to 'calculate' as it successfully tracks the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability. Over the first 10 periods, the average demand is approximately 96.7 units per period. However, there are two distinct clusters: Periods 1, 2, 6, and 7 show high demand (averaging 140.75), while others show much lower demand. The most recent demand (Periods 8-10) has been lower (average 63.6), leading to an overstocked position (On-hand: 65). The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders arriving in the same period they were placed (Lead time = 0). Since the product is 'Regular' chips and no specific calendar dates were provided to identify seasonality, I will use a balanced lookback window. I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate the mean demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent trend of lower demand while still accounting for the possibility of a sudden spike seen earlier in the history. This helps the OR backend avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock for potential demand shifts.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system starts with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 concluded periods, meaning items arrive the same period \u043e\u043d\u0438 are ordered. Demand has been volatile: initial periods (1-5) were relatively stable, but recent periods show significant fluctuation, particularly Period 6 (163) and Period 11 (142). The last 3 periods (9, 10, 11) had demands of 61, 71, and 142 respectively. Given the stockout in Period 11 (141 sold out of 142 demand), and the high variability, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the last 5 periods to capture this increased variance and shift while maintaining a robust baseline. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

=== Period 12 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, an order of 131 units was placed and arrived in the same period (L=0). Historical demand shows fluctuations but no clear structural shift yet. The average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 101. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units. Since L=0 has been consistently observed, I will maintain method='calculate'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the full recent history after the initial samples provided in the prompt, balancing the high demand seen in P11 (142) and P12 (104) against earlier lower periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 1 to Period 13 confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand has been relatively stable but exhibits some variability. The average demand over the first 13 periods is approximately 100.6 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean demand has been slightly higher, around 94.6, but includes a high of 142 in Period 11. Given the current period is 14 and the inventory is 40, and the OR backend uses a (1+L) factor, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior, and 'default' for sigma_hat to include the full historical volatility. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed reality of 0 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-14 confirms the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Therefore, I will set L to 'default'. Demand for chips(Regular) shows a fluctuating pattern. The last 14 periods of demand are: 125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59, 61, 71, 142, 104, 95, 80. The average demand across all 14 concluded periods is approx 99 units. There is no clear shift or sustained regime change; the demand appears to be stationary but volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant historical mean and variance for the backend's base-stock calculation. This will allow the OR engine to determine an order quantity that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for observed volatility, targeting a service level influenced by the $4 profit vs. $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts or seasonal trends observable in the provided period history (P1-P15). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean demand, while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 0. This approach balances the need for responsiveness to slight fluctuations against the stability of the long-term average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility, with recent demand spikes in Period 11 (142) and Period 16 (156), leading to stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to Period 16 arriving within the same period (lead_time 0). To account for the observed demand variability and prevent stockouts during demand peaks, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 11-16). This captures the higher average demand (approx 110.5) and the recent standard deviation better than the full history (approx 102). Setting L to 'default' confirms the reliability of the 0-period lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variability but remains within a relatively stable range. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 6-17), the mean demand is approximately 110.5 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 to 17 arriving in the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I will use recent demand data (N=12, covering the last stable block) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the recent average and volatility more accurately than the full history, which includes a low-demand outlier in Period 4.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with some volatility, but no clear regime shift is observed in the last several periods. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 97 units per period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out the most recent fluctuations. Since L=0 and Review=1, (1+L) = 1, the OR engine will target a base stock sufficient for one period's demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but remains within a consistent range (approx. 20-160 units). The mean demand over the first 19 periods is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation of 40 units. The last three periods (17-19) show demand of 100, 68, and 21 respectively, indicating a potential recent dip, but Period 19 seems like an outlier compared to the rest of the history. In Period 20, we start with 102 units on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. To handle the uncertainty and prevent stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a conservative average of the last 10 periods to capture current demand levels while smoothing the recent outlier (P19). I will keep L at its default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility with no distinct seasonal pattern or sustained regime shift. The most recent demand (Period 20) was 139, following a very low demand of 21. Across the first 20 periods, the mean demand is approximately 100.3. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. However, we have entered Period 21 with 0 on-hand inventory, meaning we must rely entirely on the Period 21 order to satisfy Period 21 demand. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies a slightly aggressive base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the full range of recent variability and the 'calculate' method for L as the zero lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability but remains relatively stable around a mean of approximately 100 units per period. In the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21), demand has been 100, 68, 21, 139, and 132. The mean for these recent 5 samples is 92, and for the last 10 samples (Periods 12-21) it is 102.5. Given the high volatility (sigma is significant), I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced estimate that captures recent flux without overreacting to the low demand in Period 19. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order since Period 1 arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to maintain the 0-period expectation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend over the last several periods (Periods 20-22 mean: 132), compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 101. To ensure sufficient service levels and avoid the stockouts observed in Period 21, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this elevation while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current demand variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, as confirmed by all 22 historical delivery records.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 20. Before Period 20, mean demand was approximately 97 units. From Period 20 to 23, demand values were [139, 132, 125, 74], averaging 117.5. Although Period 23 saw a dip to 74, the previous three periods suggest a sustained higher regime. The carry-over insight from the previous period notes an increase to ~132. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 23 historical conclusion messages. On-hand inventory is 60 units, and there are no in-transit units. Setting L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=4), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to adapt to the recent increase in both the mean and variance of demand.

While the initial shift seemed like a major increase (~132), recent demand in P23 and P24 has been significantly lower (74, 48), suggesting either high volatility or a return to mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this high-volatility regime and set L=0. This allows the OR backend to quickly adjust parameters based on the most recent 5-period behavior (current mean ~104, std ~40). The on-hand inventory is 95, which covers recent lower demand but requires ordering to maintain service levels against potential spikes like P20-P22.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct shift around Period 20. Before Period 20, the average demand was approximately 98 units per period. Since Period 20 (Periods 20-25), the average demand has been approximately 100.5 units (139, 132, 125, 74, 48, 85), though it remains quite volatile. The Carry-over Insight from Period 23 noted a higher shift (+39%), but recent data (Periods 23-25) shows lower values (74, 48, 85), suggesting the mean is settling. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this regime shift since Period 20. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (the order arrives in the same period it is placed), so L remains at 'default' (promised 0). I will set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility accurately. With On-hand inventory at 53 units and mean demand around 100, the OR backend needs to place an order to reach the base stock level to satisfy Period 26 demand.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean since Period 20. The most recent demand was 190 units (the highest in history), following a period of stockouts. Average demand since the regime shift at Period 20 (Periods 20-26) is approximately 124 units per period, with significant variance. Although 'Carry-over Insights' noted an increase starting P20, the last two periods (P25-P26) show even higher fluctuations. Given the promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in history), I am setting L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand regime starting from Period 20. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the increased volatility seen in this period, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle spikes like the 190 units seen in Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 remains confirmed; Period 26 shows extreme spike (190 units), suggesting continued high volatility within the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $406.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has shifted significantly upwards. From Period 20 to 27, the demand average is 113.1 (compared to the pre-20 average of 95). However, the last two periods (26 and 27) showed particularly high demand (190 and 112 respectively), and several periods in this new regime have resulted in stockouts (ending inventory=0). Given that L=0, the system must hold enough inventory to cover the current period's demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the post-shift mean while giving weight to the recent volatility. Using N=8 specifically covers the period from the detected changepoint (P20) to the present. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded period in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 119 units per period (Periods 20-28), compared to the previous average of ~95. The recent demand history shows significant volatility, with values ranging from 21 to 190. In Period 28, demand was lower than the recent average at 68 units, leaving 83 units on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. To account for the observed regime shift and the inherent volatility while avoiding overstocking due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility. Specifically, N=9 corresponds to the length of the current regime (Period 20 to 28). This allows the OR backend to calculate base stock using the most relevant mean and standard deviation for the current market conditions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows a regime shift starting around Period 20, where the average demand increased from approximately 95 to 132 units. However, recent periods (P28: 68, P29: 46) show a cooling off from the extreme spike of 190 in Period 26. Since Period 20, demand samples are [139, 132, 125, 74, 48, 85, 190, 112, 68, 46], averaging ~102. Comparing this to the pre-P20 average of ~95, the shift is less pronounced than initially thought, but volatility remains high. For Period 30, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this post-shift behavior (Periods 20-29). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 29 conclude' (ordered P29, arrived P29). With 100 units on hand and a mean demand around 100, the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) effectively targets a base stock level that accounts for the current inventory while allowing for high variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 20 is well-documented and sustained. Since Period 20, the average demand is 113.4 units, but including recent fluctuations and the spike in Period 26 (190), a higher safety margin is required. The most recent demand (Period 30) was 115 units. I will use a recent_N method with N=11 (tracking the regime desde Period 20 until Period 30) to capture the current mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units, which is significantly lower than the expected demand for Period 31, necessitating a responsive order based on the new regime's parameters.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the higher regime that began at Period 20. Since that shift, the mean demand over the last 12 periods (P20-P31) is approximately 103.5. However, there is significant volatility, with demand spikes reaching up to 190 (P26). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time (L=0) based on all conclude messages. To capture the current regime's characteristics while reactive to the high variance observed, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the entire current regime). This ensures the base stock reflects the elevated average demand (approx 103.5) and the increased standard deviation, protecting against stockouts despite the zero lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 20 is confirmed. From Period 20 to Period 32, the average demand is approximately 111 units per period, which is a significant increase from the pre-Period 20 average (~92 units). Although the Carry-over insight estimated a shift to 132, the actual realized mean for the last 13 periods (P20-P32) is 111.38. The most recent demand samples are 115, 108, and 106, showing stability near this new average. The lead time L remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this new demand regime (Period 20 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it accounts for the higher mean and the elevated volatility (including the 190 spike in P26). With L=0, base stock will be based on 1 period of demand (review + lead). Current on-hand is 33, and the backend will order up to the base stock based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 20, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~106 (calculated from Periods 20-33). Despite the Carry-over insight suggesting a higher mean of 132, the most recent 10-14 periods show a stabilization around 100-110 units, albeit with high volatility (standard deviation remains significant with spikes like the 190 in P26). The actual lead time consistently confirms as 0 periods. To account for the sustained higher average demand since Period 20 while remaining responsive to the recent volatility seen in the last 14 periods, I will use recent_N with N=14. This window covers the entire new regime and provides a more accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat for the backend OR logic to calculate the base stock level, balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime shift identified around Period 20. Analysis of demand from Period 20 to Period 34 shows a mean of approximately 100 units with significant variance (StDev ~43). While the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~132, the most recent 10-15 periods have stabilized closer to 100 on average, though with high volatility spikes like the 190 in Period 26. The promised lead time of 0 remains consistently observed in the data (all orders arrive in the period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 90 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand, high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR engine has enough samples to navigate the noise. This strategy balances the high profit margin ($4) against the moderate holding cost ($1) by maintaining a safety buffer against demand spikes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime shift identified at Period 20, with high volatility. Period 35 ended with zero inventory due to a demand of 135 units, which exceeded the current inventory levels. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, with all shipments arriving within the same period they were ordered. Since Period 20, the average demand has been approximately 98.7 units per period, but with significant spikes (e.g., 190 in P26, 135 in P35). To prevent stockouts like the one in P35, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 15 periods (since P21) to capture the higher mean and the volatility of this regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers 1+L (which is 1) periods of demand at a high service level, considering the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 20 remains consistent, though volatility is high. The mean demand from Period 20 to Period 36 is approximately 104 units, compared to the pre-Period 20 average of ~93. However, focus on the most recent 10-period window (P27-P36) shows an average demand of approximately 91 units with several high spikes (135, 141) and low troughs (34, 45). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, the OR backend must place an order that covers the expected demand for Period 37 immediately. Using recent_N (N=17, covering the entire new regime since Period 20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we capture the heightened volatility and the slightly higher average demand compared to the early history, while lead time is set to default (0).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase since Period 20, as noted in previous carry-over insights. The recent demand levels in Periods 35, 36, and 37 (135, 141, and 153 respectively) further confirm this higher regime and suggest the mean demand has drifted higher than the previously estimated 132. Over the last 18 periods (since P20), the mean is approximately 110, but the very last 3 periods average 143. Based on this accelerating trend, I am setting the demand regime length (N) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to the last 18 periods to capture the post-shift characteristics while providing more weight to the recent volatility. The actual lead time consistently confirms the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. Parameters are set to ensure sufficient stock for this high-demand phase while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated; the last 3 periods (P35-P37) show a further upward trend with demand averaging 143, compared to the P20-P34 average of ~104.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in an elevated and highly volatile state. While the average since Period 20 is around 104, the very recent data (Periods 35-37) showed a significant spike (avg 143) followed by a sharp drop in Period 38 (48 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent based on lead_time history. Given the high volatility (max demand reaching 190 in P26 and 153 in P37) and the recent uptrend noted in the carry-over insights, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=19) to capture the regime starting at Period 20, which balances the recent spikes with the lower observations and yields a more robust mean for the current regime. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=19 to specifically capture the variance of this higher-demand period, which is significantly higher than the initial history. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to handle potential 150+ unit spikes while minimizing holding costs during low-demand troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) successfully transitioned to a higher regime around Period 20, but most recently it has exhibited extreme swings (e.g., P35-P37 averaging ~143, while P38-P39 dropped to ~45). Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 units, and the promised lead time is 0. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. To capture the recent high-demand volatility and prevent stockouts during spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs during troughs, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window covers the high-demand period (P35-P37) and the recent lull (P38-P39), providing a balanced but responsive forecast for the current regime. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased in the current regime (P35-P39); mean remains difficult to pin down due to large swings between 42 and 153 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently (P35-P40), with values swinging between 42 and 153. A significant regime shift was noted starting around P20, with a further upward trend observed from P35. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P35-P40) is approximately 106, though the volatility (standard deviation) is high. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system should target a higher service level (q=0.8). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent high-volatility regime behavior while maintaining the default lead time (L=0).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) successfully transitioned to a high-volatility regime starting around Period 35. Over the last 7 periods (P35-P41), the average demand is approximately 112 units (135, 141, 153, 48, 42, 118, 147), but this hides significant swings between ~40 and ~150. In the most recent period (P41), demand was high at 147 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With on-hand inventory at 1 unit and no in-transit units, we need a robust order to cover the next period. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-volatility regime behavior while maintaining the default lead time (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 35 confirmed as high-volatility: 7-period average is ~112 units with a range of 42 to 153.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35, characterized by significantly higher volatility (ranging from 42 to 153) and an elevated mean. Over the last 8 periods (P35-P42), the average demand is approximately 108.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45.4 units. This is a clear departure from the earlier P20-P34 regime. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning we should aim for a high service level. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the high-volatility regime that started at Period 35, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the increased mean and the significant variance in this window.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 35 continues to exhibit high volatility with an average demand of approximately 112 units (range 42 to 153). Observed lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 44, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (starting from Period 35) to capture this most recent high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the frequent demand spikes seen recently (e.g., 135, 141, 153, 147 units) while acknowledging the high variance to maintain service levels. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 35 continues to show high volatility, with demand values ranging from 42 to 153. A review of the last 10 periods (P35-P44) shows an average demand of approximately 105.1 units. While the carry-over insight noted a potential upward shift earlier, the recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is slightly lower at 106.6 units compared to the surge in P35-P37. Given the high volatility and the current on-hand inventory of 49 units, I will use recent_N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime and provide a stable base for the OR backend's service level calculation (80% target based on profit/holding ratio). Lead time (L) consistently follows the promised 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 35 is now well-established with 10 periods of data: average demand is 105.1 with high variance (range 42-153).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 35 is confirmed as a high-volatility regime. The last 11 periods (P35-P45) exhibit an average demand of approximately 100.2 units (135, 141, 153, 48, 42, 118, 147, 87, 87, 94, 51). While the mean has stabilized somewhat compared to the pre-P35 period, the variance remains very high. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 88 units and the target cycle service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this recent high-volatility regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock level using the most relevant data distribution while accounting for the high volatility through the sigma calculation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 35 continues, characterized by high volatility and an average of approximately 105 units. Recent demand (P40-P46) has been: 118, 147, 87, 87, 94, 51, 104, averaging 98.3 units. The 12-period average since the start of this regime (P35) is 100.7 units. The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a higher service level is preferred. I will set mu_hat to capture the average demand of the current regime using recent_N=12. I will also use recent_N=12 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the high volatility observed in this specific period range (stdev \u2248 38.5), ensuring the OR backend maintains sufficient buffer stock to handle surges like\u90a3\u4e9b seen in P36, P37, and P41.

The demand regime starting at Period 35 is well-established with 13 periods of data (P35-P47). The average demand in this high-volatility regime is approximately 104.5 units (sum=1358, N=13). Recent demand has stabilized slightly compared to the early spikes, with the last 5 periods (P43-P47) averaging 87.2 units. However, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~80% quantile). I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the full mean and variance of this current regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=93, arrived=93 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=132, demand=90, sold=90, ending on-hand inventory=42
Daily Profit: $360.00, Daily Holding Cost: $42.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the high-volatility demand regime that began at Period 35. The average demand for this regime (P35-P48) is approximately 103.6 units, but with significant swings between 42 and 153 units. The most recent demand (P48) was 90 units, consistent with this average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Since this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 and 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory on Period 50. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the entirety of the current high-volatility regime (P35-P48), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the actual variance of this regime, which is higher than the long-term average.

Daily Profit: $264.00, Daily Holding Cost: $65.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 35 continues with high volatility. The last 10 periods (P40-P49) show an average demand of approximately 94.2 units, with values ranging from 51 to 147. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is the baseline target for the OR backend. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime behavior while smoothing out extreme short-term fluctuations. This N-value covers the data since the shift identified in Period 35 plus a small buffer of the preceding regime to ensure stability in the variance estimate.
