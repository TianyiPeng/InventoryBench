  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, there is no historical 'conclude' message to analyze lead time or arrivals. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period arrival. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged 102 units (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). Starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to satisfy the expected demand for Period 1 immediately. Given the high variance in the initial samples (standard deviation ~36), a slightly conservative order above the mean is prudent to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.

Given the current on-hand inventory of 115 units and the 0-period lead time, my strategy is to maintain a target inventory level (order + on-hand) of 165 units. This level covers the historical mean plus 1.5-2 standard deviations, sufficient to satisfy demand up to the 95th percentile (approx 165 units) while mitigating the risk of excessive holding costs which are relatively high ($1) compared to the profit ($4).
