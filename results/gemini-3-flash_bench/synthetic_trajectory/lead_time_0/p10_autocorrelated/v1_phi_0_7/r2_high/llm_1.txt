The carry-over insight from Period 49 correctly identified this softening. Historically, such drops have often preceded a stabilization near the baseline of 80-86 units or further declines. Given the current on-hand inventory of 62 units and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I need to order enough to satisfy the expected demand for Period 50. Comparing current trends (last two periods averaging ~71.5) with the historical baseline (~86), I will hedge slightly towards the baseline to prevent a stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs. Inventory management logic: Goal = Target Stock (approx. 90) - On-hand (62) = 28 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime softening confirmed: Demand has dropped from a peak of ~123 (P43-P46) to an average of ~71.5 over the last two periods (P48-P49), trending back toward historical baseline levels.",
