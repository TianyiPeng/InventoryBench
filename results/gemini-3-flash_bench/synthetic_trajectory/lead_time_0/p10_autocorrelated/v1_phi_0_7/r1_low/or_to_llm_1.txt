However, the game history shows actual demand in Period 1 was 124 and Period 2 was 95. The mean of these two periods is 109.5. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 58 units. Let's look at the OR logic: Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, so the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At q=0.5, the safety factor z* is 0. This means OR is essentially ordering to meet the mean demand without safety stock. Given the high demand volatility and the 'Order + On-hand + In-transit' need to cover (L+1) periods, and since L=0, I need to cover Period 3 demand. 5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 58 seems too low given the recent actual demand (124, 95). If I order 58, my total available for Period 3 will be 35 + 58 = 93 units. This barely covers the recent average. Since lead time is 0, I can be more responsive, but stockouts in Period 1 (sold 87 of 124 demand) suggest we need a slightly higher buffer.

The last two periods (99 and 92) were slightly lower than the P6-P11 average of 123, but still higher than the earliest samples.\n\n3. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 61 units. Using its logic, the OR agent is likely calculating its base stock based on the average of all available data points (including the low initial periods) and subtracting the current on-hand inventory (43). However, because the demand regime has shifted to a higher mean (~116-120), the OR recommendation of 61 units (expecting a total availability of 104) is too low and risks a stockout if demand returns to the average of the last 8 periods (~116).\n\n4.

The average of these last three periods is 104 units. While P19 was lower (83), the overall context of the last 10 periods (P10-P19) shows an average demand of 94.5 units, which is significantly higher than the initial samples (avg 87) and higher than the recent cooling average mentioned in Carry-Over Insight P17 (avg 80.4). Demand seems to be oscillating around 95-100 units.\n\n3. Inventory & Strategy: On-hand inventory is 30. In-transit is 0. With a lead time of 0, the total supply for P20 will be (On-hand + Order). OR recommends 70 units, which would result in 100 total units (30+70).

Final Strategy: The OR recommendation of 101 units is based on long-term historical averages and does not adequately account for the recent surge in demand (137 and 145). Since the lead time is 0, the order arrives and is sold in the same period. To avoid stockouts in the face of this clear upward trend, I am overriding the OR recommendation of 101 and ordering 145 units to match the latest observed demand level.",

The current average over the last three periods is 153.7, which is a substantial increase over the previous plateau of ~109. The OR recommendation of 103 units is based on my entire history and is lagging significantly behind this current demand surge. Given that the lead time is consistently 0 (same-period arrival) and on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 49. As the game ends at Period 50, I want to minimize the risk of a massive stockout in these final periods while being slightly cautious about holding costs for the very last step. Following the trend, I expect Period 49 demand to be between 160-175. I will order 170 units to capture this growth.",

The OR recommendation of 75 units is severely under-forecasting because it uses the entire historical sample set equally, failing to account for this significant and recent demand regime shift. The current on-hand inventory is 29 units. To provide a 100% service level for the expected demand of approximately 145-150 units, I need to order the difference between the target inventory and the current stock. Targeting 150 units of supply minus 29 on-hand requires an order of ~121. Given the recent peak of 165, I will order 135 to ensure coverage against another potential spike while balancing the holding cost (which equals profit), ensuring I don't over-accumulate if the peak subsides.",
