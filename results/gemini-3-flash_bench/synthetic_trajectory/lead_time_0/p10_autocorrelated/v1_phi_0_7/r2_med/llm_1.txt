Historical demand for the first 5 periods (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) suggests an average demand of approximately 86 units. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable but subject to variance. To minimize the risk of stockouts while considering the holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), I will target the upper end of the historical range to ensure service level.
