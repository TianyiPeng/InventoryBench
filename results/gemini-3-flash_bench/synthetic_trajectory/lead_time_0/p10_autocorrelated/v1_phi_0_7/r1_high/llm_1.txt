Lead time is reliably 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 34 units. To fully capture the expected demand of ~150 units and maintain a small safety buffer against the high volatility seen in this regime (peak of 165), I will target an available stock of approximately 175 units. Order = Target (175) - On-hand (34) = 141 units.",
