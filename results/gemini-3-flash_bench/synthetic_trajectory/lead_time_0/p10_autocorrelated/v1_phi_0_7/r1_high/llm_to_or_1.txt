Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and historical demand for the first five periods is available (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), averaging 86.4 units. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 0, the order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. I will use the mean of the available historical samples (N=5) to set the initial mu_hat and sigma_hat. The method 'recent_N' with N=5 is appropriate to capture the baseline performance without including future drift yet. My goal is to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand, which in this case is just 1 period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 107 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived successfully (arrived=107), confirming a lead time of 0. However, the actual demand in Period 1 was 124 units, which exceeded our supply, resulting in 107 sales and 0 remaining on-hand inventory. Looking at the historical demand samples (Period 1-5), the values are 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70. The actual demand observed in 'Period 1 conclude' was 124, which is higher than any of the provided samples, suggesting possible volatility or a higher demand regime than the average of the initial samples (mean ~86). To ensure we meet demand and avoid stockouts while accounting for the confirmed 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to be slightly more aggressive than the historical mean to cover potential spikes like the 124 units observed. Since current On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0, we need a full replenishment. I'll use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to balance between the older samples and the more recent high demand point.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, starting inventory was 107 (from the Period 1 order with L=0). Demand was 124, resulting in 107 sold and 17 lost sales. In Period 2, we ordered 129 units which arrived immediately (L=0), starting inventory was 129, demand was 95, ending with 34 on-hand. The historical demand samples provided are: P1: 81, P2: 97, P3: 100, P4: 84, P5: 70. However, the game history shows actual demand for P1 was 124 and P2 was 95. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0. Since demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~110 (avg of 124, 95) vs the provided samples which were likely priors, I will use recent_N to capture the actual realized demand behavior. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=2 to prioritize the observed demand in the game history over the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1179.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the demand for the first three periods was 124, 95, and 66. The historical demand data provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) suggests a mean around 86. However, actual realized demand in the first period was quite high (124). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving immediately. Currently, on-hand inventory is 75 units. Given that demand appears to be fluctuating but generally within the 70-120 range, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand volatility observed in the game history (124, 95, 66) while remaining responsive to the trend. Since L=0 is confirmed, the base stock calculation will effectively target the next period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1717.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the first five periods is 86.4 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1 through 4 arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since there is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend in the five provided samples (demand remains relatively stable between 70 and 100), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend uses a localized baseline for the base stock calculation, covering the immediate period's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer determined by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2272.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 conclude, we see on-hand inventory is down to 8 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been 124, 95, 66, 93, and 120 (mean=99.6, std=23.3). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To meet the expected demand of roughly 100 units per period while accounting for volatility (std ~23) and start with only 8 units on hand, I will set mu_hat to 100 (which covers the 1+L=1 period demand) and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a slightly higher safety buffer given the recent high demand of 120 in Period 5. The base_stock calculation by the backend will target a high service level due to the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2121.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with 26 units remaining on-hand. Looking at the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 concluded periods. The historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) and concluded demand (Period 1: 124, Period 2: 95, Period 3: 66, Period 4: 93, Period 5: 120, Period 6: 113) show a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period with a standard deviation around 18. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet, but demand is volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the actual realized demand distribution from the concluded periods, while keeping L as 'default' since the promised lead time of 0 is being met reliably.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2622.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system experienced a stockout (149 units demanded, only 138 units available including the same-period order), resulting in 0 ending inventory and 11 lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing same-period replenishment. Historical demand for periods 1-7 is: 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113, 149. Average demand is approx 108.57. There is a detectable uptrend in the last 3 periods (120, 113, 149, average 127.3). I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility and upward pressure while maintaining a safe stock level to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the recent increase in variance (high of 149, low of 113 in recent history).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred around Period 5: Average demand increased from ~95 (P1-P4) to ~127 (P5-P7), a ~34% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2203.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 39 units. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant shift starting around Period 5. For Periods 1-4, the demand average was 94.5. For Periods 5-8, the demand average increased to 125.0 (120, 113, 149, 118). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 periods. To account for this higher demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the last four periods (P5-P8). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current higher volume, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for a ~125 unit/period demand while maintaining a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1868.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift starting from Period 5. Demand samples for P1-P4 were [124, 95, 66, 93] (avg 94.5), while P5-P9 are [120, 113, 149, 118, 101] (avg 120.2). This confirms the 0P8 insight of a ~30% increase in mean demand. The L=0 lead time has remained stable across all 9 concluding periods. For Period 10, I am using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 5 periods represent the new normal. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to holding costs ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio (~0.95) will push for a high service level, which is appropriate for this higher demand level to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 5: Average demand increased from ~95 to ~120 (+26%) and remains stable over the last 5 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level starting around Period 5. For Periods 1-4, the average demand was approximately 94.5. Since Period 5, the demand levels have been 120, 113, 149, 118, 101, and 127. The average of the most recent 6 periods is approximately 121.3. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Given the current on-hand inventory is 23 units, and we have a 0-period lead time environment, the OR engine needs to target a base-stock level that covers the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 5 demand regime and maintain the default lead time (0) as it is well-substantiated by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2452.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 5. The historical demand for Periods 5 through 11 is 120, 113, 149, 118, 101, 127, and 130. The average of these last 7 periods is approximately 122.6. In the most recent period (P11), ending on-hand inventory was 18 units, and there are currently 0 units in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To respond to this stable demand regime and ensure sufficient stock to cover the upcoming period's demand (since demand happens after the decision), I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~123) and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-cost ratio of 19:1 while accounting for the recent demand shift.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand analysis confirms a stable regime shift that occurred at Period 5. Since Period 5, the demand has averaged approximately 120 units (mean of P5-P12 = 119.6), compared to the earlier average of ~95. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. For the OR backend parameters, I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the entirety of the current regime starting at Period 5. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=8 to ensure the volatility estimate reflects the recent demand behavior rather than the lower-demand start, which will help the backend maintain an appropriate safety stock level for the $19.0 profit/unit and $1.0 holding cost balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1693.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 5, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~116 since then. Although the last two periods (P12 and P13) saw lower demand (99 and 92 respectively), there is not yet enough evidence to declare a new downward shift. I will continue to focus on the post-Period 5 regime (N=9 periods) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher-demand state while incorporating recent variability. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0, matching the promised lead time, so I will stick with the default L=0. This approach ensures the inventory covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period) at the optimal service level directed by the profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1074.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 5. While the carry-over insight noted an increase to ~120, the most recent 4 periods (P11-P14) have shown a significant downward trend (130, 99, 92, 61), with P14 hitting a low of 61. The current on-hand inventory is 85 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the total demand to cover is for the current period only. I am selecting recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift average while remaining responsive to the recent deceleration in demand. Using N=10 allows the OR backend to average the data since the shift at Period 5. This will prevent overstocking if the recent decline continues while maintaining a buffer based on the higher volatility observed since Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 10, with a notable downward trend starting Period 12 (130 -> 99 -> 92 -> 61). Average demand for P5-P14 is approximately 111.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1409.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a clear downward trend since Period 11, with recent demand values being 130, 99, 92, 61, and 78. This indicates a departure from the previous higher-demand regime (avg ~120). Calculating the mean for these last 5 periods (P11-P15) gives approximately 92. Since the inventory position (on-hand 73) is currently close to this recent average and there is no in-transit stock, I need to adjust the backend parameters to reflect this lower demand level. I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent shift in volume and volatility. The lead time L is consistently 0, so I will stay with the default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12: Significant downward trend from previous 120 avg. Mean demand P11-P15 is 92 units/period (-23% from P5-P10 regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1305.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower regime. Observations from Period 12 to 16 (99, 92, 61, 78, 72) show a significant drop from the previous average (~120). The mean over these last 5 periods is approximately 80.4. Given the current on-hand inventory of 63 and the downward trend established in the 'Carry-over Insights', I am adjusting parameters to reflect this new regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand and its associated volatility while protecting against stockouts during this transition. This helps the OR backend reset the base stock level to avoid excessive holding costs in a shrinking demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 finalized: Mean demand decreased from ~120 to ~80 (P12-P16), a 33% reduction compared to the P5-P11 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant temporary spike in Period 17 (122 units) after a sustained downward trend that began in Period 12 (averaging ~80 units from P12-P16). This Period 17 surge follows a string of lower demand values (99, 92, 61, 78, 72). Given the inventory was completely depleted at the end of Period 17 (sold=106, demand=122), we need to recalibrate mu_hat to account for this higher volatility. The previous carry-over insight noted a shift to ~80 avg, but Period 17 suggests either a new upward shift or higher variance within the current regime. I will use a recent_N of 6 (Periods 12-17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent period of low-then-high demand. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods based on all delivery records appearing in the same period they were ordered.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Potential reversal or volatility increase in the Period 12 downward regime; Period 17 demand (122) is significantly higher than the P12-P16 average of 80 (+52%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2016.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile 'rebound' from a downward trend that ended around Period 16. After averaging ~80 units from P12-P16, demand jumped to 122 (P17) and 107 (P18). This suggests the previous downward regime has ended, but the new level remains uncertain and volatile. Considering the last 7 periods (P12-P18), the mean is approximately 93. However, given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target (z-score) will be high (0.95 quantile), which protects against stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatile regime while acknowledging the recent uptick in demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by 18 consecutive periods of zero-delay arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Downward trend (P12-P16 avg ~80) broken by significant recovery (P17-P18 avg ~115), indicating increased volatility and a possible return to P5-P11 levels (~115-120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1534.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows significant volatility. A regime shift occurred at Period 12 where demand dropped to ~80 (P12-P16), but this was followed by a spike to 122 (P17) and 107 (P18) before returning to 83 (P19). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), stockouts are more costly than holding cost. Demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) averages 104 units, while the peak regime (P5-P11) averaged ~120. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatile recovery pattern while maintaining a cautious buffer, as the most recent demand (83) is lower than the previous two spikes but the overall trend from P17 onwards is upward compared to the P12-P16 trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 17: Average demand for P17-P19 is ~104 units, significantly higher than the P12-P16 average of 80 (+30%), indicating a break from the low-demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~103 units following the recovery from the low-demand regime seen in Periods 12-16. Specifically, demand in the last four periods (P17-P20: 122, 107, 83, 100) averages 103 units, which is higher than the previous 80-unit regime but lower than the 120-unit peak. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this stabilized post-recovery demand while maintaining a sufficient sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility (standard deviation remains significant).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 17: Average demand for P17-P20 is ~103 units, confirming a shift from the low-demand period (~80 units) to a moderate-level stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1330.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a moderate level after a volatile period starting at Period 17. The most recent demand samples from Period 17 to Period 21 are: 122, 107, 83, 100, and 73. This averages to approximately 97 units per period. The Carry-over Insight from Period 21 correctly identifies a shift from the previous low-demand regime (~80 units) to a stabilized moderate level (~103 units based on P17-P20). Including the most recent data (P21 = 73), the average remains around 97. Historical lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this stabilized demand regime and the observed volatility, I will use a N=5 (P17-P21) to capture the current mean and standard deviation for the backend's base-stock calculation. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level (~95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 17: Average demand for P17-P21 is approximately 97 units, confirming a shift from the low-demand period (P12-P16 avg ~80 units).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate-level regime since Period 17. The average demand for the most recent six periods (P17-P22: 122, 107, 83, 100, 73, 88) is approximately 95.5 units, which is consistent with the shift identified in the carry-over insights (~97-103 units). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will use a N=6 lookback window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the significantly lower-demand period (P12-P16) and higher-demand earlier periods. Setting L to 'default' matches the observed lead time of 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 93 units per period since the shift identified at Period 17 (P17-P23 avg: 97.5; P21-P23 avg: 90.3). Period 23 saw a demand of 110, which is slightly above this average but remains within the expected volatility bounds. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable demand regime starting from Period 17, while avoiding the influence of the prior downward spike. This setting ensures a service level of ~95% based on the high profit-to-holding ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 17: Average demand for P17-P23 is approximately 97 units, remaining stable despite high volatility in specific periods (e.g., P17, P23). Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 99 units over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). The recent demand values (110 and 109 in P23-P24) suggest continued stability around this mean. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior (P17-P24). This N balances the need for enough data points to estimate variance accurately while excluding the lower-demand period of P12-P16. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that prioritizes the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding overstocking based on older, less relevant data.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate-level regime starting at Period 17, following a volatile lower-demand period (P12-P16). The average demand from Period 17 to Period 25 is approximately 97.5 units. The most recent demand (P25) was 85 units, and the regime average confirms that while the mean is around 97-100, there is still periodic variability (ranging from 73 to 122). Reviewing the history, the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. For Period 26, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (covering the stable regime from P17-P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the older, unrepresentative data. With a critical ratio of ~0.95 ($19/($19+$1)), the base stock will appropriately cover demand to maintain a high service level while minimizing waste.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 17 around a mean of ~98 units (P17-P26 average: 97.9). Recent demand observations (P24: 109, P25: 85, P26: 102) show moderate volatility, requiring sufficient safety stock to maintain service levels. The 'lead_time was 0 periods' consistently appears in the conclude messages, meaning same-period arrival is the stable reality. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current stable regime starting from Period 17, as the previous downward regime (P12-P16) is no longer representative. L will remain at 'default' (0 periods). The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock Level (S) using these parameters and order S - current_inventory, where profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 service level.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting from Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 97 units (P17-P27 mean is ~97.5). The most recent data points (P25: 85, P26: 102, P27: 96) continue to support this mean with moderate volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every historical arrival occurring in the same period it was ordered. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the system will naturally target a high service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (covering the current stable regime from Period 17 to Period 27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized mean and its associated variance accurately. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is reliably 0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 17. Over the last 12 periods (P17-P28), the mean demand is 97.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. Recent demand (P24-P28: 109, 85, 102, 96, 92) averages 96.8, confirming this stable state. Promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. I am using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variance and mean of this current stable regime while excluding the older, high-volatility/regime-shift periods. This approach provides a robust base stock that balances the high retail profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level for the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P17-P29) shows a stable but high-variance regime with an average of approximately 98 units per period. The last period (P29) saw a sudden spike to 151 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts from similar spikes while accounting for the current zero inventory state, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a window that captures this stabilized regime (N=13, from P17 to P29). A larger N would pull in the significant downward trend of P12-P16, which is no longer relevant. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that provides a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 29 (151 units) confirms continued high volatility within the post-Period 17 stable regime (avg ~98).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2305.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains relatively stable but with high volatility (seen in Period 29 with 151 units and Period 30 with 122 units). The average demand from Period 17 to Period 30 is approximately 103 units. The 0-period lead time is consistently reliable. Given the high demand in the last two periods (151 and 122), a recent_N approach (N=14) for mu_hat will capture the post-Period 17 average (~103) while the sigma_hat recent_N (N=14) will account for the heightened volatility observed recently. This ensures a sufficient base stock level to handle spikes like the one in Period 29 without excessive holding costs given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2564.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P29: 151, P30: 122, P31: 135) suggests a significant upward shift in demand, likely a new regime or a sustained seasonal spike, differing from the previous post-P17 average of ~98. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 136 units, which is significantly higher (+38%) than the previous stable period. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this new high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current demand levels to prevent stockouts, which occurred in Period 29 and nearly in Period 31.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period_29: Average demand increased from ~98 (P17-P28) to ~136 (P29-P31), a ~38% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1940.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting from Period 29. The average demand for the most recent period (P29-P32) is approximately 128.25 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~97 units. Specifically, demand in the last four periods was 151, 122, 135, and 105. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. To capture this new regime and address the recent volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4, covering the regime shift from Period 29. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~97 (P17-P28) to ~128 (P29-P32), a ~32% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2219.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 29. While the previous regime (P17-P28) averaged approximately 97 units, the average from Period 29 to Period 33 is 126.4 units (151, 122, 135, 105, 119), confirming a significantly higher mean. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this newest regime (P29-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand and the associated volatility. On-hand inventory is 42, and there is no pipeline inventory. The OR engine will calculate a base stock based on this higher mean and standard deviation to minimize the risk of stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 29: Average demand increased from ~97 (P17-P28) to ~126 (P29-P33), a ~30% sustained increase over 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1544.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 29. While previous periods (P17-P28) averaged ~97 units, the most recent six periods (P29-P34) have averaged approximately 120 units (151, 122, 135, 105, 119, 85). Despite a lower demand figure in P34 (85), the overall mean remains significantly higher than the previous baseline. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To account for this higher-demand regime and its associated volatility since P29, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=6. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current mean of ~120 units while protecting against the observed fluctuations (sigma) in this specific window. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 aligns with all historical observations.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 29. While previous periods (P29-P33) showed an average demand of ~126, the most recent values (P34: 85, P35: 87) suggest a possible softening or high volatility within this higher regime. However, to maintain a safe service level and avoid stockouts during potential spikes (like Period 29's 151), I will use the last 7 periods (P29-P35) to capture the current regime more accurately while reflecting the recent lower observations. The average for P29-P35 is approximately 115. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the current regime's mean and volatility appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $885.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift over the last three periods (85, 87, 52), contrasting sharply with the 'Period 29' regime (average ~126). This decline suggests a potential new regime shift or a temporary cooling of demand. To react appropriately while maintaining a high service level (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), I am shifting the forecast focus to the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) where demand has averaged 89.6 units, compared to the P29-P33 average. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent deceleration and prevent excessive overstocking, as on-hand inventory is currently high (103 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to use via the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~75 (P34-P36), a ~40% reduction over the last 3 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 34. For the first 33 periods, demand fluctuated around averages ranging from 80 to 126. However, from Period 34 to Period 37, demand has consistently dropped: 85, 87, 52, and 41. The average for these last 4 periods is approximately 66 units, representing a ~47% reduction from the Period 29-33 average (~126). This trend suggests a sustained low-demand regime. Consequently, I am using recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand level and avoid excessive holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so I continue with the default setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~66 (P34-P37), a ~47% sustained reduction over 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 34. The average demand dropped from approximately 126 units (P29-P33) to roughly 69 units (P34-P38), representing a ~45% reduction. The most recent demand (Period 38) was 79, which is slightly above the new regime average but still well below previous levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this new, lower-demand regime while maintaining high service levels (given the high profit margin of $19 vs $1 holding cost), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current demand level that has stabilized over the last 5 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime shifts throughout the history. The most recent shift occurred at Period 34, where demand dropped significantly. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 71.3 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104), confirming a lower-demand regime compared to the spike seen in P29-P33. Although Period 39 saw a recovery to 104 units, the overall average remains lower than the previous peak. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this current regime while accounting for the recent uptick in volatility. Setting L to default (0) as lead time has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: Average demand for P34-P39 is 71.3 units, a significant reduction from the P29-P33 peak (avg ~126), despite a recent increase to 104 in P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2106.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized after the significant drop observed between Periods 34-37. While Carry-over Insights for Period 40 noted a low average for P34-P39, the most recent demand points (P39: 104, P40: 111) suggest a recovery back toward the long-term average (~100 units). The average demand from P34-P40 is approximately 77, but the last two periods show a clear upward trend. To avoid stockouts while these recovery signals solidify, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 (covering P34-P40) to capture this recent regime while reflecting the recent upward volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a prompt order to meet period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend starting Period 39: Last two periods (P39-P40) average 107.5, compared to P34-P38 average of 68.8, suggesting the low-demand regime may be ending.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear recovery over the last three periods. After a low-demand regime (P34-P38 avg ~69), demand has shifted upward starting in Period 39 (104, 111, 108). The average demand for these last three periods is 107.7. This supports the observation in Period 41's carry-over insight of a recovery trend. Given this confirmed regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new mean (approx 108) and its associated volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. Since profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the 0-period lead time and the risk of stockouts during shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed starting Period 39: Mean demand for P39-P41 is 107.7 units, a ~56% increase from the P34-P38 low-demand regime (avg 68.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2086.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly transitioned into a new stable regime starting at Period 39. After a low-demand period (P34-P38 avg ~69), the last four periods (P39-P42) have shown consistent higher demand: 104, 111, 108, and 110 (avg ~108). This represents a recovery of approximately 56% compared to the previous trough. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To accurately capture this new regime and account for current on-hand levels (only 4 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 samples (P39-P42). This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR backend reflects the current demand level (~108 units) rather than being pulled down by the historical low-demand outliers from Periods 34-38. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, this responsive approach minimizes stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a recovery phase starting Period 39: Average demand for P39-P42 is 108.3 units, compared to the P34-P38 average of 68.8 (+57%), following a high-volatility period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized in a recovery phase starting at Period 39. Over the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 105.0 units (104, 111, 108, 110, 92), which is significantly higher than the P34-P38 low-demand regime (avg ~69). Lead time continues to be consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stable recovery phase and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current moderate volatility. This approach ensures the inventory levels are sufficient for the current demand level (~105) while minimizing holding costs for this fast-moving item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a recovery phase starting Period 39: Average demand for P39-P43 is 105.0 units, a ~52% increase from the P34-P38 low-demand regime (avg 68.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1962.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began at Period 39. Over the last six periods (P39-P44), the demand values have been 104, 111, 108, 110, 92, and 104, resulting in a mean of approximately 104.8 units. This is significantly higher than the low-demand regime observed between Periods 34-38 (average ~68.8). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (14 units) and the demand is steady around 105 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current stable recovery phase. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility level. These parameters will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains an appropriate buffer for the current regime.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the recovery phase that began at Period 39. Over the last seven periods (P39-P45), demand has averaged 109.4 units (104, 111, 108, 110, 92, 104, 137), which is a significant and sustained increase from the P34-P38 low-demand regime (avg ~69). The highest demand in this sequence occurred in the most recent period (P45: 137 units), resulting in a stockout. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent further stockouts while maintaining high service levels (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable recovery regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~110 unit demand level rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a recovery phase starting Period 39: Average demand for P39-P45 is 109.4 units (+59% vs P34-P38), with a recent peak of 137 units in P45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward significantly since Period 39. The most recent demand (Period 46) reached 145 units, following 137 units in Period 45, indicating a potential new peak or high-volatility phase within the recovery regime. The average demand for the recovery period (P39-P46) is now 113.9 units, demonstrating a clear sustained increase from the P34-P38 low-demand average of 68.8. To capture this recent trend while accounting for the high volatility observed in the last two periods (137, 145), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the entire recovery regime) to calculate the mean demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the increased volatility of this recovery phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so I will stick with the 'default' method for L. The inventory is currently at 0, necessitating a full order to cover anticipated demand for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely at Period 45: Average demand for P45-P46 is 141 units, a ~24% increase from the P39-P44 recovery average of 106.5 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand regime starting at Period 45. Observations for P45-P47 show demands of 137, 145, and 151 units respectively (average ~144.3). This represents a significant upward shift from the previous recovery regime (P39-P44 average ~105). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply for three consecutive periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this new peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this demand spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~105 (P39-P44) to ~144 (P45-P47), a ~37% increase; inventory has stocked out for 3 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2964.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth regime starting at Period 45. Recent demand figures (P45-P48) are 137, 145, 151, and 165, showing a clear upward trend and resulting in four consecutive periods of stockouts even after increasing order quantities. The current average demand for this 4-period regime is ~149.5 units. To prevent further lost sales and capture the upward momentum in Period 49, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to focus exclusively on this latest high-demand cluster. Sigma_hat is also set with N=4 to account for the increasing volatility during this spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: Significant upward trend (137 to 165) over the last 4 periods, averaging ~150 units. This represents a ~40% increase from the previous stable recovery average (~107) and has caused persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2651.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 45. While the previous stable level (P39-P44) was approximately 105 units, the last five periods (P45-P49) have seen a substantial increase, averaging approximately 147.8 units (137, 145, 151, 165, 141). Despite the slight decrease in Period 49, demand remains consistently high compared to previous weeks and has caused several stockouts between Period 45 and 48. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. To adequately cover this high-demand regime and minimize stockout risk while balancing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (P45-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand window. This will set a base stock level that reflects the current mean (~148) plus a safety factor for the observed volatility in this regime.
