Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which means orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand within this same period. Based on the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the mean is 86.4 and the standard deviation is 11.97. Since L=0, the target base stock will be based on mu_hat (1+0)*86.4 and sigma_hat sqrt(1+0)*11.97. Given it is the first period, I will use all available historical samples to set the initial parameters to ensure the system covers the expected demand for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 87 units based on early demand data, but actual demand was 103, resulting in 16 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. The confirmed lead time for the first order was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples for the first 5 periods are 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (average ~86.4). However, the realized demand in Period 1 was 103, which is higher than the mean of the provided historical samples (~86.4). Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. Given the stockout in Period 1 and the relatively high demand (103), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history including the provided samples, while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, demand (103, 117) has significantly exceeded the orders placed (87, 91), resulting in stockouts and lost sales. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts, I need to increase mu_hat. The historical demand samples provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) appear lower than the actual demand realized in Period 1 and 2 (103, 117), suggesting a regime shift or higher-than-expected volatility. I will use the recent demand observations to set a more aggressive base stock. Since L=0, mu_hat represents demand for 1 period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 110 (near the average of the last two observed demand values) and sigma_hat to 15 to account for the variance seen.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history for Period 1-3, we see that the promised lead time of 0 periods is holding true (orders arrive same period). However, in every period so far, demand has exceeded our order quantity (Demand: 103, 117, 118 vs Orders: 87, 91, 94), resulting in stockouts and lost profits. The historical samples provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) seem lower than the actual observed demand in the game history (103, 117, 118). There is a clear upward regime shift or a discrepancy between the seed data and live data. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this higher demand level (mean ~113) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the volatility of this specific live demand regime. Setting L to 'default' as lead time is confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in first 3 periods: avg demand ~113, significantly higher than pre-game samples (avg 86). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

=== Period 4 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $113.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked significantly to 152, reaching its highest point yet, whereas my order based on a mean of 113 was insufficient, resulting in a stockout. The actual demand over the first 4 periods is [103, 117, 118, 152], showing an upward trend (average ~122.5). The pre-game samples (avg 86) are no longer representative of the current regime. Since Lead Time is consistently 0, the logic must cover (1+L) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent high demand while weighting the latest spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 4. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat higher will help the OR backend increase the base stock to prevent further stockouts in this higher demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: Demand has increased significantly over the first 4 periods (avg 122.5 vs pre-game 86.4), with a notable peak of 152 in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. The historical data (Periods 1-5) and pre-game samples show a clear upward trend in demand. Mean demand for P1-P5 is 125.2, significantly higher than the pre-game average of 86.4. Specifically, demand in the last two periods (P4: 152, P5: 136) suggests a higher regime than the initial game periods. My current on-hand inventory is 0 because all arrivals were sold to cover demand, indicating consistent stockouts and lost profit. I will set L=0 based on the consistently confirmed lead time from P1-P5. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~135). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect current volatility. These settings will raise the base stock level to better meet demand and reduce lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 4-5 show a higher plateau (avg 144) compared to Periods 1-3 (avg 112.7). Significant stockouts in all 5 initial periods due to under-ordering relative to realized demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Analysis of the historical demand (Periods 1-6) shows a consistent upward trend with values of 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, and 160. Every single period has resulted in a stockout (sold = arrived, ending on-hand = 0), meaning true demand is likely even higher than the recorded demand values. The average observed demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 149.3 units, compared to the overall average of 131. Lead time is consistently 0. To break the stockout cycle and maximize profit (since profit equals holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, but the system's cap and variance protection will help), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 170 to account for the clear upward momentum and historical under-ordering. I will use the last 3 periods (the higher demand regime) to estimate volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend captures this recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand trend and stockout cycle: TRUE demand consistently exceeds ordering. Avg demand Periods 4-6 is 149.3 (+32% vs P1-P3). Recommended base stock must exceed latest demand (160) to test true market ceiling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, for the first time, we finally satisfied all demand and ended with a surplus (33 units), revealing the true demand for that period (137). Previous periods were capped by stockouts, masking true demand levels. The demand sequence observed so far (P1-P7) is: 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160, 137. The average across the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 146.25, while the average of the first 3 was ~113. The lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which means the OR engine will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Since we are currently in a high-demand regime compared to the pre-game samples, I will use recent_N (N=4) to focus on the current demand level. This will set mu_hat based on the actual observed true demand from the recent high-volume periods, ensuring we don't over-order based on the P6 peak of 160 while accounting for the recent stabilizer of 137.

Carry-over insight: True demand ceiling identified: Period 7 was the first period without a stockout (demand 137). Demand regime stabilized (Avg P4-P7: 146.25) above initial pre-game levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed a demand of 114, which is significantly lower than the previous period (137) and the peak observed in Period 6 (160). This suggests the demand regime has potentially cooled or stabilized after the initial upward surge. The average demand across all 8 periods is approximately 130. After multiple periods of stockouts (P1-P6), we have successfully fulfilled demand in P7 and P8, maintaining an ending inventory of 33 units. The lead time is consistently 0. I will refine mu_hat by using N=5 (covering Periods 4-8), which captures the more recent high-demand regime while tempering the extreme highs of Periods 4 and 6. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the recent volatility. This approach ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for the current stability, without over-ordering excessively as demand appears to be leveling out.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 7 and 8 show lower demand (avg 125.5) compared to the Period 4-6 surge (avg 149.3), ending the persistent stockout cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand dropped to 92 units, continuing a downward trend from the peak of 160 in Period 6. The average demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) is 114.3, significantly lower than the P4-P6 average of 149.3. Following the stockout cycle (P1-P6), we have successfully captured 'true demand' in P7-P9. The current demand appears to be returning toward the historical pre-game baseline (avg 86), though it remains slightly elevated. Lead time is confirmed as 0. Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand (approximated by the mean). I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower demand regime and prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand has reverted from a peak of 160 (P6) to a lower level, averaging 114 over P7-P9 (-24% vs peak regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly transitioned from a high-growth/peak phase (P4-P6, avg ~149) to a lower, more stable regime (P7-P10, avg ~107.5). The most recent demand observations (P9: 92, P10: 87) suggest the demand has returned towards levels seen early in the game or even pre-game samples (avg 86). Since lead time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock formula simplified for a single-period horizon (L=0) becomes (1+0) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the OR engine will aim to set the base stock equal to mu_hat. To adapt to this recent cooling period and avoid excessive holding costs (which equal profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (P7-P10), which represents the current post-peak regime. This N=4 window captures the stabilization at ~108 units while moving away from the P6 peak of 160.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Periods 7-10 show a stabilized lower demand (avg 107.5) compared to the Period 4-6 peak (avg 149), a ~28% reduction.

chips(Regular): ordered=80, arrived=80 units (ordered on Period 11, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=108, demand=48, sold=48, ending on-hand inventory=60
Daily Profit: $48.00, Daily Holding Cost: $60.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand dropped significantly to 48, the lowest since the game began. The recent history (Periods 7-11) shows a clear downward trend from the earlier surge (P4-P6), with more recent demand averaging 95.6 over the last 5 periods (137, 114, 92, 87, 48). The Period 11 demand of 48 suggests the downward regime shift is accelerating or there is a local trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the ending inventory is 60 (which already exceeds Period 11's demand), a cautious ordering approach is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining a buffer, as the profit and holding cost are equal (leading to a 50% service level target in the base stock calculation).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift accelerating: Period 11 demand dropped to 48 units, significantly below the P7-P10 average of 107.5 (-55%). Recent 5-period average (P7-P11) now stands at 95.6.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand recovered slightly to 64 units from the previous low of 48. This confirms a clear downward shift in demand compared to the mid-game peak (Period 4-6 average: 149) and even the subsequent stabilization period (Period 7-10 average: 107.5). The most recent 6 periods (P7-P12) show a mean demand of 90.3 with significant volatility (std dev ~33). Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock only needs to cover the current period's demand. With 32 units on hand and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio yielding a target service level of 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), the OR engine should align the base stock with the median demand of the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this entire down-shift phase while smoothing out the extreme low of P11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift significantly below mid-game levels: Recent 6-period (P7-P12) average is 90.3, compared to the P4-P6 peak average of 149.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly cooled from the peak observed in the middle periods (P4-P6 avg ~149) and is also lower than the mid-regime (P7-P10 avg ~107.5). The most recent three periods (P11-P13) show demand levels of 48, 64, and 68, averaging 60. This confirms a sustained downshift. The current on-hand inventory is 23 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand regime, preventing excessive holding costs while meeting the current lower sales volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed and stabilized at lower levels: Periods 11-13 average demand is 60.0 units, a ~44% drop from the P7-P10 average of 107.5 and significantly below the early game peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization at a much lower level compared to the mid-game peak of ~150 units. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), observed demand has been 48, 64, 68, and 60, resulting in an average of 60.0 units. This is a clear downward regime shift from the P7-P10 average of 107.5. In Period 14, the ending inventory was exactly 0, suggesting the balance between supply and demand is currently tight at this lower level. Given that the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the target base stock should align closely with the mean demand to minimize the sum of stockout risks and holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new stable low-demand regime and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at this scale. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a significant peak earlier in the game. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 48, 64, 68, 60, and 84, averaging 64.8. Period 15 saw a slight uptick to 84, resulting in a stockout (on-hand was 60). Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning we should order close to the mean demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent stabilized regime (avg ~65), while sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has shifted from the P11-P14 low (avg 60) to a slightly higher level in P15 (84), though still significantly below the mid-game peak average of 149.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown erratic behavior but a clear recent trend toward stabilization slightly above the previous low regime (P11-P14 avg ~60). Demand in Period 15 (84) and Period 16 (89) indicates a confirmed upward shift from that low, though it remains significantly below the mid-game peak (avg 149). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in the last two periods, where orders (60 and 65) failed to meet realized demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this new 'moderate' demand regime and stop the stockout cycle, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 periods (P11-P16) to bridge the previous low and current rise, creating a more responsive base stock while preventing over-ordering if demand is just experiencing a minor peak. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target (critical for low-margin/high-cost perishables or heavy items like chips), but since stockouts are recurring, I need the OR backend to be more aggressive in its safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 15: Demand increased to avg 86.5 (P15-P16) from the preceding Period 11-14 floor (avg 60), resulting in two consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new growth phase. In Periods 15-17, demand has risen sequentially from 84 to 107, averaging 93.3. This clear upward trend has resulted in three consecutive stockouts because the ordering policy was lagging. Specifically, Period 17 demand (107) significantly exceeded the previous two periods. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new peak to ensure a high service level and break the stockout cycle. Using an explicit mu_hat of 115 (just above the latest observed demand of 107) will ensure enough inventory to meet potential further growth in Period 18. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this latest growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime confirmed: Periods 15-17 show a steady increase (84, 89, 107) with an average of 93.3, moving up from the Period 11-14 floor (avg 60). This has caused 3 consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history clarifies a growth trend starting from Period 15, moving from a demand floor of ~60 units to a new stabilization level. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand values were 84, 89, 107, and 109, respectively. This gives a recent_N (N=4) average of 97.25 units. Period 18 was the first period since Period 13 where we avoided a full stockout (ending on-hand: 6), confirming that a base stock above 100 is necessary to capture this regime's demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P15-P17 while avoiding excessive holding costs (which equal profit), I will target the most recent demand levels. I'll set mu_hat to capture the current 97-110 range using the last 4 periods as the regime anchor.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime stabilized: Periods 15-18 show an average demand of 97.3, significantly higher than the P11-P14 floor of 60. Stockouts resolved in P18 with an order of 115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand (107) slightly exceeded our starting inventory (98), leading to another stockout and 0 ending inventory. Looking at the growth regime that started in Period 15, realized demand has been 84, 89, 107, 109, and 107. This establishes a clear new regime with an average of 99.2 (approx. 100). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and satisfy demand in the 100-110 range, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 (P15-P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will align the base stock with the current demand level. Since lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1, targeting a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 100 units: Average demand for Periods 15-19 is 99.2, representing a sustained recovery from the Period 11-14 floor (avg 60).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase. Average demand from Period 15 to 19 was approximately 99.2 units, but Period 20 saw a decrease to 74 units. Looking at the recent regime (Period 15-20), the mean demand is 94.8 units. The stockout observed in Period 19 was resolved by on-hand inventory in Period 20, leaving 26 units remaining. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining service levels, I will use the recent 6 periods (Period 15-20) to capture the current stabilized demand level which is higher than the Period 11-14 floor but lower than the mid-game peak of 149.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the recovery from the Period 11-14 floor. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), the mean demand is 95.2 units (107, 109, 107, 74, 79). While there was a slight dip in the most recent two periods (74 and 79), the overall average since Period 15 (when the shift began) is 93.6. Given that profit per unit ($1.0) equals holding cost per unit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the mean demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture this current stable level (average ~95) while remaining responsive to the recent lower values. This ensures we cover lead time (0) + review period (1). Effective lead time consistently remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand was 98, resulting in a minor stockout (2 units lost) as only 96 units were available. The demand regime has shifted again from the Period 15-19 average (~100 units) to a lower level over the last three periods (P20-P22 avg: 83.7). This confirms the stabilization noted in recent carry-over insights but suggests a slightly lower mean than the 100-unit ceiling previously observed. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current holding cost equals profit ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio is 0.5; the OR engine will target the median demand. To capture this recent lower stabilization while protecting against the volatility seen in P22 (98), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covering P18-P22 where demand was 109, 107, 74, 79, 98), providing an average of ~93.4 units to the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted lower starting Period 20: Periods 20-22 average demand is 83.7 units, down from the Period 15-19 average of 99.2 (-15.6%).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted globally since Period 20, with an average demand of 81.5 units (P20-P23) compared to the previous peak average of approx 99 units. In the most recent period (P23), demand was 75 units, leading to an ending inventory of 19 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.50, which implies the base stock should stay near the mean of the current regime to minimize total costs. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this latest stabilization (avg ~82) and reduce over-ordering, while the sigma_hat 'recent_N' will account for the moderate volatility observed in this period (range 74-98).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 20 onwards) has shown stabilization around 85 units, but Period 24 saw a stockout with demand of 98 exceeding the available inventory of 82. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To address the persistent volatility and ensure we don't under-order after a stockout, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P20-P24) which captures the current level of ~85 units, plus a buffer. Specifically, the mean of the last 5 demand values (74, 79, 98, 75, 98) is 84.8. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively becomes the base stock target for the next period. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current period-to-period variability (which includes two peaks of 98 in the last three periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a baseline that has shifted several times. The most recent established regime starting from Period 20 shows average demand around 84.8 units (P20-P25: 74, 79, 98, 75, 98, 80). There was a stockout in Period 24, suggesting demand volatility remains significant even if the mean is lower than mid-game peaks. Current on-hand inventory is low (5 units). Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime and provide sufficient responsiveness without excess holding costs, I am using a recent_N of 6 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, covering the period from P20-P25.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 85 units per period over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), with moderate volatility (~10-15 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 114 units, exceeding the recent average (P20-P25 avg: 84.8). This resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). While the Carry-over Insight noted a stabilized regime around 85 units, the last two out of three periods (P24 and P26) have shown demand near or above 100 (98 and 114). To avoid further stockouts and maximize profit, I will adjust mu_hat to capture this recent increase in volatility and mean. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend service level q = 0.5, meaning it targets the median. I will use recent_N (N=7) to calculate demand, covering the period since the last meaningful regime shift (P20-P26), which averages approximately 91.1 units. This provides a balance between the stable 80s and the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P24-P26: periodic spikes to ~100-114 units observed despite a previous stable average of 85. Stockouts occurred in 2 of the last 3 periods due to these spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand was 108 units, which led to a complete stockout since the order/on-hand was only 89. This confirms a recent sequence of higher demand spikes (114, 108, 98) compared to the previous stable average of ~85. The system remains in a zero-lead-time regime (L=0). To prevent further stockouts while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (optimal service level is 50%), I will use recent_N to capture this current higher demand regime. I am selecting N=8 to cover the period from P20 onwards, where demand has been fluctuating with these higher peaks. The mean of P20-P27 is approximately 92. The goal is to set a base stock that covers this increased mean and some volatility to recapture lost sales seen in P26 and P27.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with a sequence of upward spikes (P24: 98, P26: 114, P27: 108), causing frequent stockouts when ordering near the 85-unit historical mean. Monitoring if this settles into a new mean ~95 or reverts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 24-28) shows a clear upward shift in volatility and mean, with demand figures of 98, 80, 114, 108, and 101. These consecutive high values (averaging 100.2 over the last 5 periods) confirm that the previous stabilization point of ~85 is no longer sufficient, leading to frequent stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods. The lead time remains consistently 0. To address this sustained increase, I am switching the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this higher regime. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to properly account for the increased volatility (standard deviation during this 100.2-mean period is significantly higher than the earlier stable phase), which will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Recent 5-period average (P24-P28) has risen to 100.2 units from a previous stable level of 85 (+18%), causing frequent stockouts. Volatility has also increased during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 24-29) has consistently signaled an upward shift, with demand values of 98, 80, 114, 108, 101, and 106. This averages 101.2 units, significantly higher than the previous stable average of ~85. Due to this shift and the 0-period lead time, we have experienced frequent stockouts (P24, P26, P27, P28, P29) because ordering was based on historical means that lagged the current trend. To mitigate further lost sales and capture the true demand of this new regime, I am setting mu_hat to use the last 6 periods (N=6, covering P24-P29) which captures this higher plateau. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (~101 units) between Period 24 and Period 29, characterized by high fulfillment pressure and frequent stockouts when inventory was maintained at lower levels.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than mid-game lows. Over the last 7 periods (P24-P30), demand has averaged 99.3 units, significantly higher than the previous stable average of 85. While Period 30 saw a slight dip to 88 units, the previous five periods (P25-P29) consistently showed demand near or above 100 (Avg 101.8). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high demand volatility (ranging from 80 to 114 recently), I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent upward shift and increased variance while allowing the OR engine to maintain a buffer against the frequent stockouts observed between P24 and P29.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward around Period 28, with mean demand stabilizing near 100 units (Avg P24-P31: 100.6). The previous period (P31) saw a demand spike to 120, resulting in a stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts at this higher demand level and capture potential further spikes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the current regime (approx 100.6 units) and will use sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the increased volatility (std dev ~13 units) observed in this window. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 101 units (P24-P31) with increased volatility; recent spikes reaching up to 120 units (P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-demand, high-volatility phase that began around Period 24. For the last 9 periods (P24-P32), the average demand is 103.2 units, with several peaks exceeding 110 units (P26, P27, P31, P32). The most recent demand was 114, following a 120, and the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory due to multiple consecutive stockouts/near-stockouts. To break the stockout cycle and properly cover this higher mean, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this specific regime. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=9) to reflect the recent increase in volatility (standard deviation ~12.5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-demand phase that began around Period 24. Since Period 31, demand has been consistently elevated (120, 114, 117), leading to three consecutive stockouts as inventory failed to meet the true market demand. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 106.6, but the most recent 3 periods average 117.0. Given that the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (orders arrive and are sold in the same period), I need to set mu_hat high enough to capture this current peak and break the stockout cycle. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current regime's mean while allowing the sigma_hat to reflect the significant volatility observed in these spikes. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the ~117-120 demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Recent 3 periods (P31-P33) show a sustained high-demand plateau (avg 117) compared to the P24-P30 average of 102.1, resulting in zero ending inventory for three consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting around Period 31, with a high-demand plateau averaging approximately 111.5 units over the last 4 periods (P31-P34: 120, 114, 117, 95). While P34 showed a slight dip to 95, the previous three periods were consistently above 110, leading to stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 is being honored. To prevent stockouts during this current high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current plateau (avg ~111.5). sigma_hat will also use recent_N of 4 to account for the significant volatility seen in this window (std ~11.5). This slightly more aggressive posture ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the peak demand seen recently, balancing the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.5 critical ratio, though the cap logic will provide some safety).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (~112 units) between Period 31 and Period 34, with P34 showing a slight moderation to 95.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the most recent period (P35: 68 units), following a high-demand plateau that averaged around 112-117 units between Periods 31 and 33. This decrease caused a jump in ending inventory to 44 units. Historically, this SKU has exhibited multiple regime shifts (surges followed by corrections). Given the consecutive drops from 117 (P33) to 95 (P34) and now 68 (P35), I am adjusting the demand forecast downward using the last 5 periods (P31-P35) to capture this cooling trend (avg ~103) while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift from Period 34 peak: Recent 2-period average (P34-P35) is 81.5, a 30% drop from the P31-P33 plateau (avg 117).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a peak plateau averaging 117 units (P31-P33), demand dropped to 68 in P35 but rebounded to 102 in P36. The carry-over insights previously flagged a downshift based on Period 35's result, but Period 36's demand of 102 units suggests that the regime has not permanently collapsed to the 80s, but rather stabilized back toward the ~100 unit level observed between Periods 24-30. With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to order roughly the median demand. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility (ranging from 68 to 117 over the last 6 periods) while reflecting the rebound to 102, I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high plateau, the recent dip, and the recovery, providing a balanced forecast for the current unstable environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significant; the sharp drop to 68 in Period 35 was transient, with Period 36 rebounding to 102, suggesting a stable mean around 100 units rather than a sustained downshift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows continued high volatility around a mean of approximately 100 units. Period 37 demand was 107, following 102 in Period 36 and a transient dip to 68 in Period 35. This confirms that the demand has stabilized back to the level seen between Periods 24-33 (avg ~101) after a brief fluctuation. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 periods (P27-P37) to capture this 'high volatility/stable mean' regime. N=11 is chosen as it covers the era from when the demand first stabilized above 100 units through the recent fluctuations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for frequent spikes (like the 120 in P31) while maintaining a service level that prevents the recurring stockouts observed when inventory is too lean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around a mean of ~100 with significant volatility (spikes to 120, dips to 68) between Period 27 and Period 37. Average demand for this 11-period window is 103.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-demand regime with significant volatility. Demand in Period 38 reached 126 units, the highest since the Period 4-7 surge, resulting in a complete stockout (ending inventory 0). The moving average over the last 11 periods (P27-P37) is 103.3, but the most recent pulse (P38) suggests a risk of demand continuing at or above the 120-unit mark. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To minimize stockout risk and maximize profit\u2014given that profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), leading to a target service level of 50% in the base stock formula\u2014I will set mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand plateau and volatility. Using recent_N=12 (P27-P38) provides a stable mean of approximately 104 units and captures the observed variance (sigma) which includes the spikes to 120+. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for the current period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a high-volatility state centered around 104 units (P27-P38 avg), with periodic spikes exceeding 120 units causing stockouts (P31, P32, P33, P37, P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile but centered around a mean of ~104 units (Periods 27-39 average is 106.3). Recent periods show high fulfillment pressure (Period 38: 126, Period 39: 118), leading to stockouts or zero ending inventory. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median. To prevent stockouts during these upward spikes, I will use a recent_N approach (N=13, covering the start of this high-volatility regime at Period 27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current mean and the significant variance observed lately. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units over the long term (P27-P40), though it remains highly volatile with frequent spikes (e.g., P38: 126, P39: 118) and occasional dips (P40: 88). In Period 40, demand dropped to 88, leaving 18 units on-hand. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set the base stock high enough to cover these periodic spikes (which can reach ~120-130 units) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 37-39. The average demand of the most recent 14 periods (P27-P40) is 104.9. I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat to capture this current regime's mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=14 to reflect the significant observed volatility, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for these frequent demand surges.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units over the long term (P27-P41), but remains characterized by significant volatility with spikes reaching 120-126 units (P31, P32, P33, P38, P39) and dips to the 80s-90s (P40, P41). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand in P40 (88) and P41 (94) suggests a slight cooling from the high-110s seen in P38-P39, but the high stockout frequency in previous periods mandates a cautious base stock setting. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 (covering Period 27 to present) to capture this high-volatility regime mean (~104) and variance, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to buffer against the frequent spikes while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 11 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high-volatility state since Period 27: mean demand ~104 with frequent spikes above 120 units and occasional dips to ~70-90. Stockouts occur frequently when replenishment targets are set near the mean.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 27 at a mean of approximately 104 units, but with significant volatility and frequent spikes (e.g., P38: 126, P39: 118, P42: 108). In Period 42, a stockout occurred because the available inventory (104) was insufficient to meet a demand of 108. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during these high-demand spikes while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 16-period regime (P27-P42) which captures this higher volatility and mean. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost, the OR backend's service level target (q=0.5) will naturally aim for the median; however, because the system frequently stocks out when ordering near the mean, I am using recent_N=16 to ensure the statistical parameters reflect the current high-variance environment accurately.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized into a high-volatility state centered around a mean of ~104 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 120 (e.g., P31, P38, P43). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 43 where demand (121) exceeded the available inventory (104). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during these recurrent spikes, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N set to 17 (covering Period 27 to Period 43). This N ensures the parameters reflect the current volatile regime rather than historical lower-demand periods. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to improve service levels in the face of frequent demand surges.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-volatility regime centered around a mean of ~104 units, but recent periods show an upward trend (P43: 121, P44: 133). In Period 44, on-hand inventory was completely depleted (ending inventory 0), resulting in 28 units of unmet demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to set a base stock that covers the anticipated demand for the current period (Period 45) while accounting for this recent surge and historical volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the stable but volatile regime from Period 27 to now) which currently averages around 104-105, but because recent demand has spiked to 133, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to provide a wider buffer to prevent further stockouts as we enter the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in P43-P44 (avg 127) compared to the P27-P42 regime average of 104, causing immediate stockouts.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting at Period 43, with the average demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) reaching 123.7 units. This is a substantial increase from the previous high-volatility regime (P27-P42) which averaged ~104 units. This spike has resulted in three consecutive periods of stockouts (P43, P44, P45) because orders were constrained by 'cap' logic or were based on the previous mean. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this new demand level and mitigate further stockouts in the final periods of the game, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focus on the most recent regime (P43-P45) ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher mean (~124) and the increased volatility observed during this spike. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's internal target service level is 50%, which may be too low for this volatile product. Utilizing N=3 specifically for sigma_hat will help increase the base stock relative to the recent variance shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike regime confirmed starting Period 43: Recent 3-period average (P43-P45) is 123.7 units, a 19% increase over the P27-P42 average of 104 units, causing persistent stockouts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward starting Period 43, with a 4-period average of 122.75 (P43: 121, P44: 133, P45: 117, P46: 120), clearly exceeding the previous long-term average of ~104. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this higher mean and account for the significant volatility observed in peaks (e.g., 133 in P44), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to weight the recent surge. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated volatility seen in the current high-demand environment which frequently leads to stockouts if the buffer is too thin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-activity phase that began around Period 43. Average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 119.4 units, maintaining the upward shift from the previous regime (~104 units). While Period 47 showed a slight moderation to 106 units, the preceding four periods consistently saw demand between 117 and 133 units, leading to several stockouts. Since we are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), and the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to capture the current high demand without overstocking at the end of the game. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this higher mean (~119), ensuring base stock is sufficient to handle the recent spikes while on-hand inventory (17 units) is subtracted by the OR engine. Carrying slightly more inventory is preferred over lost sales given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (50% critical ratio), especially since demand has frequently exceeded 120 units recently.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current demand regime shift, identified at Period 46, shows a higher mean (~112 units based on P43-P48 average) compared to the previous long-term average (~104). However, demand in Period 48 dipped to 75 units, increasing on-hand inventory to 45. To maximize profit and avoid high holding costs while still protecting against the high-volatility spikes observed throughout the game (often exceeding 120 units), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average (P43-P48) which captures the current high-demand regime. This provides a balance between the recent spike (133) and the most recent dip (75). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) will allow the OR engine to react to the current volatility and mean shift while accounting for the recent demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43 confirmed: Avg demand P43-P48 is 112.0 units, with high volatility (range 75-133).

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the end of the game. For the single SKU chips(Regular), the demand regime has shown a significant softening over the last two periods (P48: 75, P49: 68), following a high-demand spike regime (P43-P47 avg ~119). The avg demand for the last 5 periods (P45-P49) is 97.2 units, while the last 3 periods show a clear downward trend (106, 75, 68). Currently, we have 44 units on-hand. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), which means the base stock should target the median demand. We use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the transition from the P43 spike to the recent softening (avg P43-P49 is ~104). We use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this window (ranging from 68 to 133). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening at Period 50: Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P48-P49 avg 71.5) compared to the preceding P43-P47 spike (avg 119.4).
