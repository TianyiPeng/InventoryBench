The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the same period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. My goal is to maximize total reward (Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory). Given the holding cost is $1.0/unit (equal to the profit margin), overstocking is as penalizing as understocking. I will order 86 units to cover the expected demand for Period 1.

Since lead time is 0, what I order now will arrive immediately to satisfy this period's demand. I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Based on the historical demand for P2 (97) and P3 (100), and the P1 surprise (103), I will target slightly above the historical average for P2 to avoid another stockout, aiming for approximately 105 units.
