Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of roughly 118 units (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). The most recent value (177) is high, so I will prioritize ensuring availability for a potential high-demand period while being mindful of the $1 holding cost. Given the sequence (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), I'll target an inventory level of ~150 units to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs, especially since on-hand is currently 0.",

To determine the order for Period 2, I need to cover Period 2 demand (which occurs after my decision). Given historical demand samples [80, 120, 120, 93, 177] and the first actual observation of 106, the mean is approximately 115-120 units. To ensure I don't stock out while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I want to target an inventory level that covers the high end of expected demand. Targeting a stock level of approximately 150 units: 150 (target) - 44 (on-hand) = 106 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has recently shifted from a high-volume spike (P41-P46 mean: ~134) to a lower, yet recovering, level (P47-P49 mean: ~70). Specifically, demand dropped significantly to 53 and 65 in P47-P48 before rebounding to 93 in P49. With the promised lead time of 0 consistently holding (arrivals conclude in the same period), I need to cover Period 50's demand. Given the recent recovery towards the long-term stable mean of ~100-110 units and the risk of holding costs, I am forecasting demand for P50 around 100-110 units. My current on-hand inventory is 61. Ordering 49 units will bring my total available stock to 110, which covers the expected demand while minimizing the inventory carry-over risk at the end of the simulation.",
