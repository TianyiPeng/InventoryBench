Given the recent high demand (132 being the peak), a target levels of 125 might be risky if demand surges back up.\n4. Strategy: I will slightly increase the order relative to the OR recommendation. To cover a potential return to the 132 level while holding some safety stock, I aim for a total availability of ~140-150 units.

Looking at recent demand history (P43-P47): 141, 118, 124, 113, 53. The average for this recent window is ~110 units. The most recent demand (P47) was an outlier low (53), which OR is using as its primary anchor. However, the 'Carry-over Insight' from P47 suggests a moderated regime of ~124 units. TotalPeriods=50, meaning we are at Period 48. We only have Periods 48, 49, and 50 remaining.\n\nStrategy: OR recommends 53 units, targeting a base stock that covers expected demand. With 81 units on hand and a lead time of 0, ordering 53 units brings total available inventory for Period 48 to 134 units (81 on-hand + 53 arrival). This aligns well with the moderated demand average of ~124 and provides a small buffer for variance.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). This means orders placed in Period 49 will arrive and be available for Period 49 demand. Demand analysis: Recent demand from P41-P48 shows a volatile but generally higher regime compared to early periods. While P47 (53) and P48 (65) were lower, the average from P41-P48 is ~115 units. The Carry-Over Insight from P47 estimates demand at ~124 units. Inventory analysis: We currently have 69 units on-hand. To cover a Period 49 demand of ~120 units, we need approximately 51 additional units. The OR recommendation is 64 units, based on a base-stock policy that factors in a high critical fractile (Profit 4 / Holding 1 = 0.8 fractile). Given this is the penultimate period (P49 of 50), we should ensure enough stock for P49 while being mindful that any excess on-hand at the end of P49 will incur holding costs before P50. However, the cost of a stockout ($4 profit loss) is 4x the cost of holding ($1). Therefore, following the OR recommendation of 64 units is prudent to protect against the higher end of the current demand regime (69 + 64 = 133 total available units).",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data from Period 1 through Period 49 consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Inventory & Demand Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: while Period 41-43 saw a peak (avg ~149), the last three periods (P47-P49) have dropped significantly (53, 65, 93), averaging 70.3. However, the overall demand for the moderated regime (P43-P49) is approximately 101 units. Final Strategy: The OR recommendation of 93 units is based on historical averages including recent periods. Given that this is Period 50 (the final period of the game), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Expected demand for Period 50 is likely between 70 and 110. An order of 90 units, combined with the 40 units on hand (total 130), provides a safe buffer for even the higher end of the recent demand spectrum without excessive surplus.",
