Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and the promised lead time is 0. Based on the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the mean is approximately 118. The current inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed now should arrive and satisfy demand within this period. I will use the mean of the provided historical samples as the starting point for mu_hat. Given the variability (std is approx 37), I will use 'recent_5' to capture this data immediately. L is set to default (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 150 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0 confirmed by the conclude message), resulting in 106 sales and an ending on-hand inventory of 44. The historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) have a mean of 118. The actual demand in P1 was 106, which is aligned with this distribution. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0, we need to cover demand for current period (Review + Lead = 1 period). I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to stabilize the forecast against the historical samples while acknowledging the P1 observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand in these two periods was 106 and 111, respectively. Combined with the pre-game samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the overall mean is approximately 115.29. However, the last three observations (177, 106, 111) suggest a mean closer to 131 if we include the high Period 5 sample, or ~108 if we only look at the most recent periods during live play. Given the inventory level of 40 and 0 in-transit, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand cluster. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean. I will set N=4 to include the high sample from Period 5 and the two live periods to ensure adequate stock against potential spikes.

Daily Profit: $428.00, Daily Holding Cost: $47.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 47 units. Historical demand for the three concluded periods was 106, 111, and 107 (average: 108.0). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they were placed. The standard deviation over these three periods is very low (approx 2.6). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this steady demand and the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the actual 0-period performance. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining a safe but not excessive inventory level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked to 138, exceeding our starting inventory of 111 (stockout). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent across all four concluded periods (P1-P4). Historical demand samples are 106, 111, 107, and 138. The mean demand is approximately 115.5 with a standard deviation of about 15. Given the stockout in Period 4 and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio favoring a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), we need to ensure the base stock covers at least the expected mean plus a safety margin to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump in Period 4. Setting L to 'calculate' will maintain the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, inventory concluded at 26 units with no pipeline stock. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (current period arrival) across all five periods. Demand over the last 5 periods (including historical context provided: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177) has been variable. However, looking at the actual realizations in the history log (106, 111, 107, 138, 103), the mean is approximately 113. The standard deviation is approximately 14.5. Period 4 saw a stockout because demand (138) exceeded the sum of starting inventory and the Period 4 order. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the stable demand regime observed during the game play. Lead time will remain at the promised value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'Period X conclude' messages confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arriving in the same period as the order). There are no missing shipments as in-transit is 0 and all previous orders arrived. Demand has been somewhat volatile: Periods 1-5 averaged 113 units, but Period 6 saw a significant drop to 42 units. Given this sudden drop, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to adjust more quickly if this is a downward trend, while maintaining a safety buffer. For L, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed for all 7 periods (P1-P7). Demand is currently in a lower-volume regime following a peak in Period 4. The average demand across all historical samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177 from user data; 106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42, 83 from status data) shows fluctuations but remains centered around ~100-110 units. However, looking at the last 3 periods (P5-P7), demand has stabilized at a lower mean (avg ~76). I will use N=3 to capture this recent drop in demand (42 and 83) while still accounting for the previous higher period (103) to avoid understocking. Sigma is set to default to capture the full historical variance, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer given the profit vs. holding cost ratio (4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $366.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with a slight downward trend compared to initial periods (mean of last 3 periods is ~73 vs. global mean of ~98). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), and there are no units in transit. Since L=0, the order placed this period will arrive immediately to satisfy demand. I will use the last 5 samples (detecting a shift around Period 4-5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which better reflect the recent demand volatility and mean, ensuring we recover from the low inventory position without overstocking given the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability with a slight mean shift. The first 5 periods (including historical context) averaged 102 units, while periods 6-9 averaged approximately 79 units. However, looking at the full history available (14 data points including user-provided pre-history), the mean is 102.5. Recent demand (P6-P9) has been 42, 83, 94, and 97. P6 was an outlier (42), but the last three periods (83, 94, 97) suggest a return to the long-term average. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every concluding message from P1 to P9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand (P5-P9 average is 83.8), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant decrease in the last two periods (P9: 97, P10: 53) compared to the prior average of ~100. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 52 and the recent demand dropping indicates a potential shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent trend without being overly reactive to the single P10 outlier. This balances the profit margin of $4.0 vs $1.0 holding cost by adjusting the base stock level to more recent demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system stocked out (sold 95 against a demand of 97), resulting in zero on-hand inventory for Period 12. Analysis of the 11 periods of internal history shows demand ranging from 42 to 138, with a mean of approximately 94. The promised lead time of 0 periods has held consistently. To recover from the stockout and maintain high service levels (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use the actual mean and standard deviation from all available data samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach provides a stable baseline for the OR engine to calculate the necessary base-stock level to satisfy current demand and rebuild safety stock.

Period 11 resulted in a stockout (sold 95, demand 97) because the starting inventory plus the same-period order was only 95. In Period 12, the order was 128, which resulted in 44 units remaining after 84 were sold. Demand does not show a clear regime shift or seasonal spike yet. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the trend of the last 10 periods while giving less weight to the initial high-demand seeds provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5 mean was higher). This should provide a stable forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat while maintaining a responsive service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but displays moderate volatility. Over the last 13 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the initial samples provided) is approximately 96.6 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P4-P13), demand has averaged 87.2 units, though there was a significant dip in P6 and P10. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.8. Since L=0, the base stock targets only the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the slightly lower recent demand trend while maintaining enough history to buffer against the observed volatility. Sigma_hat will also use the last 10 periods to reflect recent variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units with none in transit, which is below the expected demand mean, necessitating a refill order.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods over 13 periods. Demand mean stabilized around 87 units/period over the last 10 periods (P4-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 11 periods (P4-P14). Calculating the mean for this regime (P4-P14): (138+103+42+83+94+97+53+97+84+79+88) / 11 \u2248 87.1 units per period. The standard deviation for this same period is approximately 24.8. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~87 units plus a safety buffer while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 22. Given L=0, the formula (1+L) simplifies to 1, focusing the backend on one period's demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 87.2 units per period over the last 12 periods (P4-P15), which is lower than the initial spike seen in P1-P3. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed at the start of the period arrive within the same period's arrival resolution phase. Current on-hand inventory is 31 units. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs, I am using recent demand data (N=12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and I am setting the lead time L to the proven value of 0. The OR backend will use these to adjust the base stock to approximately (1+0)*87.2 + z*sigma_hat.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 16 spiked to 132 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of 87 units. While the Carry-Over Insight noted stability, this spike (following another high demand of 138 in Period 4 and several near-100 values) suggests that the mean has shifted or volatility is higher than expected. The actual lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent upward trend (P12-P16 demand: 84, 79, 88, 78, 132; mean=92.2). Using N=5 for sigma_hat will also better reflect current volatility. With L=0, the target base stock needs to cover (1+0) periods, and the OR backend will calculate the order as max(0, base_stock - on_hand - in_transit).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 16 (demand = 132), breaking the previous stable mean of 87 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. In Periods 16 and 17, demand was consistently 132 units, which is a major jump from the previous 10-period average of roughly 87 units. This shift has led to stockouts in both Period 16 and Period 17, with 'ending on-hand inventory' at 0. Because L=0, the OR backend's order calculation needs a highly responsive mu_hat to cover this new demand level and avoid further lost sales. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot entirely to the new demand regime (132 units/period). Lead time (L) remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' message in every concluded period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: demand stabilized at 132 units/period (compared to previous mean of 87), causing stockouts in P16 and P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand dropped to 81 units, which contradicts the 'new demand regime' of 132 units/period suspected in Periods 16 and 17. Looking at the history, demand appears highly volatile but returns frequently to a mean around 85-95 units (P12-P15: 84, 79, 88, 78; P18: 81). The spike to 132 in P16-P17 was likely a transient surge or high-variance event rather than a permanent step-change. I will revert to using a mid-range window (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture recent behavior (including the spike) without overreacting solely to the high values, resulting in a mean estimate around 100 per period. Lead time remains confirmed at 0. \u03c3\u0302 is set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility observed in the last 3 periods. This approach balances the need to recover from stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand remains low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 (132 units) was likely transient; Period 18 demand (81) aligns more closely with the previous P4-P15 mean (~87).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a return to relative stability after a two-period spike (P16-P17 at 132 units). Period 18 saw demand of 81 and Period 19 saw 105. The average demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 5) is approximately 89 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Using L=0, I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to reflect the long-term stable mean while incorporating the recent slight volatility. sigma_hat will be calculated over the same window to provide a buffer for the observed fluctuations like those in P16-P17 and P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 20 reached a new peak of 186 units, following a volatile period (P16-P19) where demand oscillated between 81 and 132. This suggests a significant and sustained increase in demand variance or a new higher demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the imminent demand of Period 21. Calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P16-P20) captures this recent volatility (mean=127.2, std\u224839) more effectively than the long-term average. This higher mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend generates a larger order to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~80%).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: Volatility has increased significantly with recent peaks of 132 (P16, P17) and 186 (P20), raising the average demand from ~87 to ~127 over the last 5 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has been 132, 132, 81, 105, 186, and 167. This averages approximately 134 units/period, a significant increase from the previous long-term average of 87. Two stockouts have occurred in the last two periods (P20, P21) because the system didn't carry enough safety stock to handle these peaks. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover and prevent further stockouts, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime for both the mean (mu_hat) and the volatility (sigma_hat). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the observed peaks of 160-180+ units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Mean demand increased from ~87 to ~134 (+54%) with significantly higher volatility (peaks > 180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a structural shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand has increased to approximately 131.9 units/period (132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120), a significant jump from the previous long-term average of ~87. Volatility has also surged, with standard deviation in this window reaching roughly 35. Over the last 3 periods, demand has averaged 157.7, though Period 22 saw a slight relative dip to 120. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this new, higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to the high volatility (peaks of 186), I will use the last 7 periods (the length of the identified regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate and variance to minimize stockouts, which occurred in Periods 16, 17, 20, and 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted definitively at Period 16. Since then, demand has been higher and more volatile (P16: 132, P17: 132, P18: 81, P19: 105, P20: 186, P21: 167, P22: 120, P23: 133). Calculating the mean for this new regime (P16-P23) gives approximately 132 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new average using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility. The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, so the OR engine will target the 80th percentile of this higher demand distribution to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs for the current on-hand inventory of 29 units.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (P16-P23) has a mean of ~132 units/period, representing a significant increase from the previous ~87 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16. In the most recent regime (P16-P24), demand mean has increased to approximately 130 units per period compared to the previous ~87. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Recent demand samples show higher volatility (ranging from 81 to 186). For Period 25, I am using a recent_N approach (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture this higher mean and volatility for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand levels while providing enough safety stock to manage the observed spikes, minimizing lost sales which have occurred frequently since the regime shift.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~87 to a significantly higher and more volatile state. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 132.3 units/period, compared to the initial mean of ~87. Recent demand at P25 was 147 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 25 concluded periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1), I am setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~87 to a higher, more volatile mean. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the average demand is 131 units (132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120, 133, 112, 147, 120). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this significant shift while accounting for recent high-demand spikes (P20, P21, P25), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to isolate this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher average demand and increased volatility, maintaining high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 27, the mean is approximately 127.7 units per period with a standard deviation of about 29.5. The most recent demand of 89 in Period 27 is on the lower end, but it remains consistent with the volatility observed in this regime (range: 81 to 186). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Using recent_N with N=12 (representing the full duration of the current regime from P16-P27) provides the most robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accommodates the current average and volatility while accounting for the lead time of 0 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28, the mean has risen to approximately 127.8 units per period, compared to the pre-P16 average of ~89. Although there was a slight dip in the most recent periods (P27-P28), the overall trend and volatility (peaks up to 186) support maintaining parameters based on this higher-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=13 (capturing P16-P28) provides a stable yet responsive estimate of both the mean and the increased variance. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by every transaction in the history, allowing for same-period arrival. mu_hat will target the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so 1+L=1).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has shown a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the initial 15 periods. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 123 units, with significant spikes up to 186. Although the last three periods (P27-P29) have seen lower demand (89, 115, 76), the overall regime since Period 16 remains the most relevant for capturing current volatility and average levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (P16-P29), ensuring the base stock level accounts for the higher mean and the observed variance to prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand history from P16 to P30 (the last 15 periods), the mean demand is approximately 121 units/period, with high volatility (standard deviation ~31). This is significantly higher than the initial levels recorded in the first 15 periods (~87). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the simulation history, allowing for same-period arrival and responsive replenishment. Period 30 data (demand 105, ending on-hand 44) reinforces this new regime. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand mean and volatility while excluding the earlier, lower-demand period. L remains at the promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been empirically validated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P30 confirmed: Mean ~121 units/period, standard deviation ~31. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level than the first 15 periods. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is 121.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has been slightly lower (average 97.6), but to ensure a high service level given the profit margin (75% service level minimum, but OR logic targets $4/($4+$1)=0.80), I will use the established regime (N=16) to capture the overall volatility and mean of this higher-demand period. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. Using N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire 'new normal' period starting from the shift at P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with a more stable pattern observed from Period 22 onwards. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P22-P32), the mean demand is approximately 111.45 units/period with a standard deviation of 21.03. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Since L=0, the order arrives within the same period (Review + Lead = 1 period). I will use N=11 to capture this recent, stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current demand level better than the long-term average which is weighed down by the early lower-demand periods (P4-P15). This setup allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the current period's demand while accounting for the recent moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P22-P32 shows a lower mean (~111) compared to the initial shift in P16-P21 (~132), suggesting a slight cooling or stabilization at a new mid-level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a stabilization in recent periods. Following the significant regime shift at Period 16 (where mean demand jumped to ~132), the last 12 periods (P22-P33) indicate a slightly lower and more stable mean of approximately 111 units/period. The most recent demand (P33) was 86 units, continuing a trend of oscillation around this new mid-level. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized demand while remaining responsive to the observed volatility (standard deviation remains significant), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to cover this specific stabilized window since Period 22. This balances the need to account for the post-shift environment without being overly influenced by the initial high-growth spike seen between Period 16 and 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the high-volatility period observed between P16 and P21. Since Period 27, demand has consistently stayed below 120 units, with the last 8 periods (P27-P34) showing a mean of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of about 14. This indicates a clear shift from the previous regime (P16-P26 mean ~132). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level, I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock based on this updated profile.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 27: mean demand has decreased to ~96 units/period (from ~121 in the previous regime) with lower volatility (std ~14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a regime that stabilized around Period 27. Analyzing demand from Period 27 to Period 35, the mean is approximately 95.3 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 12.5. The most recent demand (P35) was 104, which is slightly above the mean but within the expected volatility range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P27-P35) captures this stable lower-demand regime while excluding previous higher-volatility peaks. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer based on recent variance, minimizing holding costs while maintaining high availability.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new regime starting around Period 27, as identified in previous carry-over insights. Analyzing demand from P27 to P36, the mean is approximately 95.4 units (89, 115, 76, 105, 103, 111, 86, 86, 104, 89) with a standard deviation of roughly 12.3. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the arrival history. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and the backend z-score for the base stock is approximately 0.84. I will use the last 10 periods (P27-P36) to parameterize the OR engine, as this captures the most recent stable regime effectively. On-hand inventory is currently low (20), but since lead time is 0, the order placed this period will arrive in time to satisfy Period 37 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts throughout the game. Following a high-demand period (P16-P26), demand stabilized in a lower regime from P27 to P36, with a mean of approximately 98 units per period. However, Period 37 saw a sharp spike to 132 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). Given the critical priority to avoid further stockouts while lead time remains stable at 0, I am adjusting parameters to account for the most recent 11 periods (P27-P37) to capture both the stabilization and the recent volatility. This provides a mean of ~101 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=11) to ensure the backend captures the recent increase in variance, effectively raising the base stock to protect against further demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand spiked again in P37 (132 units), causing a stockout. While the mean since P27 remains lower (~101) than the P16-P26 peak (~132), volatility has increased.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we analyze the current demand context for chips(Regular). The historical demand exhibits several regime shifts. The most recent stable regime (P27-P36) had a mean of ~96 units. However, Period 37 saw a sharp spike to 132 (causing a stockout), followed by 98 in Period 38. The carry-over insights correctly flag increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 38. Given the recent spike and the subsequent return to a level near the P27-P36 mean, I will use recent_N with N=12 (covering P27 to P38) to capture the current mean while accounting for the recent increase in volatility. This window balances the lower demand seen since P27 with the recent instability. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime established around Period 27, though with occasional spikes like Period 37 (132 units). The mean demand for the most recent 13 periods (P27-P39) is approximately 100 units/period (total 1300 / 13). Recent periods (P38-P39) show demand of 98 and 106, which is very close to this mean. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), and the lead time is 0, the OR backend needs to place an order that covers the immediate demand. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat to capture this stable 'lower' regime (~100 units) while using a recent_N of 13 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the Period 37 spike. This allows the OR engine to maintain a safety stock that buffers against such peaks without over-ordering based on the much higher P16-P26 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P27-P39 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~100 units per period, with a standard deviation of ~15, despite a single spike to 132 in P37.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units/period and a standard deviation of ~15, despite occasional spikes. Period 40 saw a lower demand of 64 units, which increased the ending inventory to 49. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive in the same period to meet demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=14 (covering P27 to P40) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the recent low outlier. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for typical volatility in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 41: 147) significantly exceeded the stabilized regime mean of ~100 identified from P27-P39, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests either another period of high volatility or a potential regime shift similar to P16-P23 which saw peaks above 130-140. Lead time remains consistently 0. To protect against these recurring high-demand spikes (P37: 132, P41: 147) and maximize reward given a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will shift the lookback period to capture the recent increased volatility. N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat includes the period from P27 onwards plus the recent spikes, providing a more balanced but cautious forecast for the current period's demand which occurs before replenishment is visible in the next conclude message.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has spiked again in Period 41 (147 units), following a similar spike in Period 37 (132 units), resulting in stockouts. The previously stable mean of ~100 (P27-P39) may be shifting upwards or exhibiting higher tail risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a significant shift starting around Period 41. Demand in Period 41 was 147 and in Period 42 it reached 160, both of which are substantially higher than the previously established regime mean of ~100 (P27-P39). This has resulted in two consecutive periods of stockouts (P41, P42). The CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS also noted rising volatility and tail risk. To prevent further stockouts and adapt to what appears to be a new high-demand regime, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods (P40-P42), which captures the recent spike (mean of ~124). For sigma_hat, I will use a recent window of 7 periods (P36-P42) to capture the increased volatility (including the spikes of 132, 147, and 160) without being overly reactive to a single data point. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 41: Mean demand has surged to ~153 units over the last 2 periods, significantly exceeding the previous regime mean of ~100 and causing immediate stockouts.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand, high-volatility regime starting at Period 41. Demand values for the last three periods are 147, 160, and 141, significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. This shift has led to stockouts in Periods 41 and 42. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures this new mean of ~149.3 units. Given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts in a high-demand period, I will also set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to better reflect current fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed through P43).

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 41: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~149 units/period (+49%), resulting in immediate stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent significant structural shift starting at Period 41. Demand over the last four periods (P41-P44) has been 147, 160, 141, and 118, averaging approximately 141.5 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the previous stable mean of ~100 observed between P27 and P40. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 44 consecutive data points. Currently, on-hand inventory is 40 units. To minimize lost sales while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current volatility within this new regime (std is approx 18.2). This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which targets an 80% service level based on the $4 profit and $1 holding cost) accounts for the higher volume and risk of stockouts during this final phase of the game.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 41: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~142 (+42%) based on 4 periods of evidence (P41-P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 41. Over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand has been 147, 160, 141, 118, and 124, resulting in a mean of 138 units/period. This is a substantial increase from the previous mean of ~100. While recent demand shows a slight downward trend (160 to 118 to 124), it remains well above the prior baseline. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting parameters to recent_N=5 ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to cover this higher volume and volatility, preventing the frequent stockouts observed in P41 and P42 while balancing against holding costs as demand potentially stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime (P41-P45) confirmed with a mean of 138 units/period and increased volatility, compared to the previous mean of ~100.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-volatility regime starting at Period 41, with demand instances reaching as high as 160 units (P42). While the initial surge was massive (mean ~154 for P41-42), the last four periods (P43-P46) have settled into a slightly lower but still elevated range with a mean of ~124 units (141, 118, 124, 113). The overall mean for this regime (P41-P46) is approximately 134 units with significant volatility. Given the 0-period lead time, the system needs to cover current period demand from on-hand inventory plus the immediate arrival of the order placed in this decision phase. To avoid the stockouts seen in P41 and P42, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P41-P46 confirmed: Mean 133.8 units/period, standard deviation ~18.5. This is a 34% increase from the previous P27-P39 mean (~100).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at P41, moving from a mean of ~100 to a higher level. Over the last 7 periods (P41-P47), demand has been: 147, 160, 141, 118, 124, 113, 53. While the mean of this segment is ~122, the most recent observation (P47) was a significant drop to 53. However, given the profit margin (4:1 ratio), the cost of a stockout is much higher than the holding cost. The carry-over insights correctly identified a surge, but the last three periods (P45-P47) show a downward trend (124, 113, 53). I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this entire high-demand regime including the recent drop, ensuring the OR backend's service level logic (based on the 4/5 critical ratio) protects against potential bounce-backs in these final periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P41-P47 shows high initial peaks followed by a cooling trend; recent demand moved from ~150 to 53 in P47. Mean for P41-P47 is ~122.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 41 (initially averaging ~140-150 units) has shown a cooling trend over the last two periods (P47: 53, P48: 65). This drop suggests the high-demand volatility observed since P41 is continuing or the regime is shifting again. However, the last 8 periods (P41-P48) average ~115 units, while the very recent 3 periods (P46-P48) average ~77 units. Given the inventory on-hand of 87 and the zero lead time, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full scope of the recent volatile regime (P41-P48) while allowing the OR backend to account for the most recent variance. This balances the risk of another spike (like P42's 160) against the recent low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P41-P48 shows high volatility with an initial surge (mean ~140) followed by a sharp cooling in P47-P48 (mean ~59). Overall period mean is ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 41 was initially characterized by a sharp surge (mean ~140 across P41-P46), but the last three periods (P47: 53, P48: 65, P49: 93) indicate a significant cooling of demand. This recent 3-period average is ~70 units, drastically lower than the early-regime surge. Given the current on-hand inventory of 55, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (covering the entire P41-P49 period) to capture the overall volatility and this recent cooling trend while still protecting against the high tail risk observed earlier in the regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: After the P41 surge (mean ~140), demand from P47-P49 has averaged ~70 units/period, suggesting the high-demand regime is subsiding or transitioning to a more moderate level.
