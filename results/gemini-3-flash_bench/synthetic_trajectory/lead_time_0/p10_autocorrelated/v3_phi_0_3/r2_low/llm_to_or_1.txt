Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have zero on-hand inventory and the initial demand sample history shows an average of 117.2 units over 5 periods. The promised lead time is 0, which means orders placed now arrive within this same period. Based on the demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), there is a noticeable spike in the most recent period (P5). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use the average of all 5 available samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish an initial baseline. Since lead time is zero, L+1 = 1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 106, which is higher than the initial sample mean of 98.6. The promised lead time of 0 was confirmed (ordered and arrived in Period 1). With a high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $1.0), the service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) targets the median. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to capitalize on the most recent demand data (N=5 from the historical samples plus the observed Period 1 demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently very low (5 units) and there are 0 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across P1 and P2 (arrived the same period they were ordered). Demand has shown a slight upward trend (P1: 106, P2: 111). Since the profit to holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To avoid stockouts in the upcoming period given the 0-day lead time and immediate consumption, I'll use the most recent 2 periods of data (N=2) to estimate demand (average = 108.5) and volatility to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns. Setting L to default (0) as promised and confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (Period 1, 2, and 3 orders arrived in the same period). Current demand is relatively stable, with historical samples of 106, 111, and 107 (average ~108). Period 4 starting on-hand is low (2 units). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this stable demand level of ~108 units across the (1+L)=1 period review interval. Sigma will also be calculated based on these 3 samples to account for observed variance.

Daily Profit: $108.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-4 confirms an actual lead time of 0. Demand for the first three periods was stable (avg ~108), but Period 4 saw a significant jump to 138, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0, lost sales of 30). In Period 5, demand has reached 177, confirming a sharp upward trend or shift in demand regime. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level (q) target is 0.5, but due to the stockout and rapidly rising demand, I need to adjust mu_hat more aggressively. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand will capture the recent spike (107, 138, 177) more effectively than the full history, while 'default' sigma will account for the increased volatility from this shift. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: demand increased from an average of ~108 (P1-P3) to 138 (P4) and 177 (P5), indicating a significant positive trend/spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent spike (P4: 138, P5: 177 - Note: The history text for P5 says demand was 103, but the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt explicitly lists P4: 93 and P5: 177. I will prioritize the provided 'Historical Demand Data' list (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) which shows high volatility but a recent significant jump to 177). With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim to meet the median demand. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. Given the high variance and the jump in P5, I will use a 3-period average (P3-P5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher activity without overreacting solely to the single 177 peak. Sigma_hat will be set to 'default' to incorporate the full history's volatility to protect against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Sample P5 (177) is significantly above the initial average (~100), suggesting potential for high-demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand dropped significantly to 42 units, contrasting with the high demand seen in Periods 4 and 5 (138 and 103 respectively in the concluding messages, though historical samples provided in the prompt listed 93 and 177). Re-evaluating the historical demand samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and the concluded demand (106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42), there is high volatility but the most recent observation suggests a sharp decline. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded observations. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand mean and sigma to capture the full range of recent volatility while acknowledging the current inventory surplus (On-hand: 74). Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: demand dropped to 42 in Period 6 following high-demand periods, requiring a broader recent sample (N=6) to stabilize forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. After the spike in Period 4 and 5 (138 and 103 sold, though actual demand was 177 in P5 according to user prompt history but P5 conclude shows 103), the demand dropped significantly to 42 in Period 6 and rebounded to 83 in Period 7. The 'Carry-over insights' mention a spike to 177 in Period 5, but the 'Game History' for Period 5 conclude shows demand was 103. Regardless, the demand is inconsistent. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the volatility while avoiding overstocking (holding cost = profit), I will use the average of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) for demand and the standard deviation of the last 7 periods to capture the full range of recent swings. This balances the recent lower demand with the memory of the earlier spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 94 vs starting on-hand 92, resulting in 2 units of lost sales). The ending inventory is 0 and there are 0 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Historical demand is quite volatile, with recent samples (P4-P8) showing 138, 103, 42, 83, and 94. The high volatility (standard deviation) and the fact that holding cost ($1) equals profit ($1) results in an optimal service level (q) of 0.50, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand to minimize total costs. Using a recent window of N=5 periods (P4-P8) captures the most current demand behavior (mean ~92) which is more representative than the full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 9 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent periods (P8 and P9) resulting in stockouts because inventory was insufficient to meet demand (P8 demand 94 vs 92 available; P9 demand 97 vs 92 available). To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect more recent trends. Using recent_N=5 captures the volatility from P5-P9 (demands: 103, 42, 83, 94, 97) while giving enough weight to the recent stockout events. This will help the OR backend set a safer base stock level given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), which target a 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Recurring stockouts observed in P8 and P9 (approx 5% lost demand) indicate that despite the 0 lead time, current safety stock parameters are too lean for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 53, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime, but Periods 8 and 9 showed stockouts (lost demand) where supply exactly equaled order amounts but failed to meet actual customer needs. This confirms the need for a higher safety stock due to volatility. The Lead Time is consistently 0. To capture the recent variability while protecting against the stockouts seen in P8-P9, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering P6-P10: 42, 83, 94, 97, 53) to reflect the current mean (73.8) more accurately than a long-term average, and I'll use explicit sigma_hat to increase the safety buffer because standard deviation-based methods on small samples exhibit high error. I will set sigma_hat to 35 to provide a more robust buffer against the spikes observed earlier (e.g., P4 and P5).

Carry-over insight: P8-P9 stockouts confirm that a 'just-in-time' approach with L=0 is failing during demand spikes; a higher safety stock (sigma_hat) is required despite low average demand in P10.

Daily Profit: $74.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system stocked out again (starting on-hand 74 vs demand 97), resulting in 23 units of lost sales. This marks the third stockout in the last four periods (P8, P9, P11), confirming that the current inventory targets are too lean to accommodate the high volatility (recent demand has ranged from 42 to 177). Although the promised lead time is 0 and arrivals have consistently been L=0, the 'just-in-time' logic of ordering only what is needed for the current period is failing due to demand variability at the moment of realization. To fix this, I am increasing the safety stock parameter (sigma_hat) using a recent sample of N=5 to capture this heightened volatility, and using mu_hat with N=5 (average ~88) to avoid over-weighting the very high P5 spike or the very low P6 dip. This should force the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock level to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout pattern: Stockouts in P8, P9, and P11 confirm that the current safety stock buffer is insufficient for the demand volatility observed after Period 4. A larger sigma_hat is required despite L=0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system arrived at an ending inventory of only 1 unit, following a history of frequent stockouts (Periods 4, 8, 9, 11). The critical issue is that with a promised lead time of 0, the order arrives during the same period, but since demand is resolved after the arrival, our 'starting on-hand' for demand resolution is strictly the current period's order plus leftover inventory. The backend's safety stock calculation currently leaves zero margin for error when demand exceeds the mean (mu_hat). For Period 13, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while recovering from the stockout cycle. I'm selecting N=9 to include the variance from the high-demand periods (P4, P5) and the recent stockout events, ensuring the sigma_hat is large enough to trigger a more substantial safety stock buffer. Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 50%, but since stockouts are costly in terms of lost profit, I must ensure sigma_hat captures the recent standard deviation accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe an on-hand inventory of 9 units. History shows a pattern of recurring stockouts (P4, P8, P9, P11) and tight inventory levels (P12, P13), even though the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The demand since Period 10 has averaged approximately 78.25 units (53, 97, 84, 79), but the volatility remains significant (range 42 to 177 throughout history). My objective is to prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, due to the high frequency of lost sales when demand unexpectedly spikes, I need a more robust safety stock. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the post-initial-spike demand regime (from Period 4 onwards), which better reflects the current volatility and mean compared to the lifetime average. This will provide a balanced \u03bc\u0302 and a more realistic \u03c3\u0302 to protect against the variance seen in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows consistent volatility and frequent stockouts (P4, P8, P9, P11, and P14), despite an average demand that appears to have stabilized around 80-90 units in the most recent periods (P12-P14). In Period 14, we stocked out again with demand (88) exceeding starting inventory (87). Since the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level q = 0.5. Given the high frequency of lost sales, a simple mean-based approach is resulting in insufficient stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to cover the period since the major demand shift in P4, providing a more robust estimate of both mean and standard deviation to better capture the volatility that lead to these stockouts. While L remains 0, the \u03c3\u0302 must be sufficient to cover the spikes observed in the 80-140 range.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Chronic stockouts (P4, P8, P9, P11, P14) despite L=0 confirm that a service level target based on mean demand is too low for this item's volatility. A longer history (N=11) is required to capture the full range of demand spikes.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.50 if applying the simple Newsvendor logic, which would target the median. However, historical demand (P1-P15) shows high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 23) and frequent stockouts (P4, P8, P9, P11, P14), indicating that mean-based ordering is insufficient. Specifically, demand spikes above 100 occur frequently while the average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 85. With L=0, the order arrives within the same period, but we must cover that period's demand without seeing it first. Given the persistent stockouts even when on-hand inventory was close to the mean, I am using a recent window (N=11) to capture the higher volatility seen since Period 4. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat specifically targets this volatility to increase the safety stock buffer and prevent the chronic stockouts observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we experienced another stockout (demand 132, sold 82), marking the 6th stockout in 16 periods (P4, P8, P9, P11, P14, P16). The actual demand of 132 is significantly higher than recent averages, confirming that this SKU has frequent high-demand bursts that the current base-stock logic is failing to capture. Despite a promised lead time (L) of 0, the current replenishment strategy is too lean given the Profit ($1.0) to Holding Cost ($1.0) ratio, which implies a target service level of 50%. However, due to the high penalty of lost sales and the specific volatility observed since Period 4, we must increase the safety stock. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=13) to capture the variance from the recent spikes (like P16) and a slightly smaller N for mu_hat (N=7) to better track the recent average demand while providing enough buffer to prevent repeated stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Extreme demand spike confirmed in Period 16 (132 units); frequent stockouts (37.5% of periods) indicate that standard safety stock calculation for this SKU is insufficient to handle the right-tail volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting significant right-tail demand volatility, evidenced by consecutive demand spikes of 132 units in Period 16 and Period 17, which led to stockouts. Despite a promised (and consistently realized) lead time of 0 periods, current inventory levels are failing to meet demand spikes. The Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR target service level (q) is 50%. Since the OR engine uses a base-stock policy that targets this low percentile, it naturally leaves 0 safety stock if standard methods are used on volatile demand. To force the inventory system to hold more buffer and prevent the chronic stockouts noted in the history, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat. I am increasing sigma_hat to 60 to reflect the standard deviation of recent volatile periods and the large gap between average demand (~90-100) and peak demands (132-138). I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 140 to ensure the base stock (mu + z*sigma) is high enough to cover the recent peak demand levels, as the 50% service level otherwise defaults to just ordering the mean.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes of 130+ units (P16, P17) confirm that targeting the mean demand (approx 95) is insufficient for this SKU; the high stockout rate (41% through P17) necessitates a 'safety-first' parameter adjustment despite the L=0 lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 18, the stockout rate is approximately 39% (7 out of 18 periods). Demand has shown high right-tail volatility with recent spikes of 132 in P16 and P17, though P18 dropped to 81. The Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1) ratio implies a service level target of 50%, but because lead time is 0, the standard OR logic may result in stockouts if the signal is noisy. Period 6 (42) and Period 10 (53) represent low-demand outliers that pull the average down, while Periods 4, 16, and 17 represent high-demand spikes. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility, I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-regime demand average (which includes several high spikes) and use explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to provide a more robust safety buffer against the observed volatility (demand range 42-177). Lead time remains 0 as evidenced by the consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Service level under-performance confirmed: 39% stockout rate through P18 despite L=0. High-demand spikes (130+) occur unpredictably after low-demand periods, requiring a sigma_hat buffer significantly higher than the standard deviation of recent samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through 19 periods, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' has experienced a stockout in 8 periods (approx 42% stockout rate). This indicates that the current ordering logic significantly underestimates the right-tail demand volatility. Specifically, demand spikes of 130+ (P16, P17) and 100+ (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P11, P19) occur frequently enough that the service level target must be elevated. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue to use a recent demand window (N=16) to capture the regime shift that started after P4, but I will explicitly set a higher sigma_hat. The standard deviation of demand from P4-P19 is approximately 25.5. Given the high stockout rate (Profit=Holding=1 implies a target service level of 50%, which is currently being missed), I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (avg ~95) and boost sigma_hat to 40 to ensure sufficient buffer against the recurring 130+ spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Persistent 42% stockout rate confirmed through P19; the target service level of 50% (derived from Profit=Holding=$1) is not being met by default parameters. High demand spikes (130+) require a sigma_hat (~40) significantly higher than the standard deviation of recent samples (~25) to prevent stockouts during low-to-high demand transitions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 20, the SKU has experienced an unacceptable 45% stockout rate (9 out of 20 periods) despite a promised and confirmed lead time (L) of 0. The most recent period (P20) saw an extreme demand spike of 186 units, following a sequence of high-volatility events (P16/P17 at 132 units). The OR backend's default parameters target a 50% service level (since Profit=Holding=$1), which is insufficient for this product's right-tail demand distribution. To address this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the recent high-demand average (~125 units) and sigma_hat to a high value (50) to force a larger order. This should counteract the zero-inventory state starting Period 21 and provide a buffer against the recurring 130-180 unit spikes. I am maintaining L=0 as historical data consistently confirms same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Extreme demand spike of 186 units in Period 20 confirms that the demand ceiling is much higher than previously estimated. The stockout rate has reached 45%, substantiating that a service-level approach based on a simple mean is not robust against this SKU's volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 21, the product exhibits extreme demand volatility with a stockout rate of 48% (10 out of 21 periods), despite a promised and realized lead time of 0. Recent demand shows a massive upswing with a peak of 186 in Period 20 and 167 in Period 21. The backend's base-stock logic (where q = 0.5 when Profit=Holding) targets the median demand, which is fundamentally insufficient for this high-tail risk SKU. Last period's order of 125 was inadequate against a demand of 167. To break the cycle of stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method to force a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect these recent high-demand peaks. I'm setting mu_hat to 160 (near the recent average of P20-P21) and sigma_hat to 60 to ensure the safety stock buffer covers spikes up toward 220+, which is necessary given the pattern of demand growth and the current 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified: P20 (186) and P21 (167) confirm a new high-demand regime, making the previous mean-based targeting obsolete. Cumulative stockout rate is now 48%.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a clear high-demand regime, with demand spikes of 186, 167, and 120 in the last three periods (P20-P22). This follows a long history of frequent stockouts (nearly 50% rate), indicating the inventory policy has been consistently under-estimating right-tail volatility. The promised lead time is 0, which has been consistently met. To address the recent shift while maintaining resilience against the SKU's high volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the average demand of the current regime (~157 units). For sigma_hat, I am using an 'explicit' value of 45.0 to provide a robust safety buffer, as the standard deviation of recent samples alone has historically failed to prevent stockouts during the frequent pull-to-high demand transitions observed in this item's history.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: High-demand regime confirmed (P20-P22 avg: 157.7 vs prior avg ~95). Safety stock must be prioritized over holding cost to combat a cumulative 48% stockout rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained high-demand regime with extreme volatility. Recent demand (P20-P23) averages ~151 units, significantly higher than the long-term average. The stockout rate is approximately 48% (11 out of 23 periods resolved), indicating that the OR engine's default service level (50% given Profit=Holding=$1) is insufficient because it treats the distribution as symmetric, whereas we are seeing frequent right-tail spikes (up to 186 units). In Period 23, the system sold 133 units, leaving 25 on-hand. To prevent further stockouts in this high-regime cluster, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 160 (near the recent average) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 50. Using 'explicit' for sigma_hat bypasses the backend's standard deviation calculation (which is lagging due to lower-demand periods in the history) to force a larger safety buffer needed for this SKU's unpredictable spikes. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: High-demand regime persists (P20-P23 average 151.5). Stockout frequency remains critical (~48%), requiring explicit safety stock overrides (sigma_hat=50) to handle right-tail spikes that the standard deviation of all samples fails to capture.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime, with an average of approximately 144 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). Despite the promised lead time of 0, the SKU has a historical stockout rate of nearly 50% due to extreme right-tail spikes (up to 186 units). In Period 24, demand was 112 units, leaving 48 units on hand. To avoid recurring stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~144. I will maintain an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to ensure a robust safety buffer against the significant demand spikes observed in the recent regime, as the standard deviation of recent samples (approx 31) remains insufficient to cover the maximum observed demand of 186.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: High-demand regime (P20-P24) mean is 143.6 units, significantly higher than the long-term average (~105). Volatility remains extreme with a peak of 186; safety stock must account for this 40+ unit gap between mean and peak demand.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 concluded with another stockout (demand 147, sold 144), confirming that even within the high-demand regime (P20-P25), the volatility is causing frequent service failures (total stockout rate now ~46%). The mean demand for the high-regime (last 6 periods) is 144 units. However, we've seen spikes up to 186. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the OR backend's target service level is 50%, which is essentially targeting the median. This has proven insufficient for this SKU's right-skewed tail. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand mean (~144) and utilizing an explicit sigma_hat of 55. This explicit value is roughly $1.25 	imes$ the standard deviation of the last 6 periods (which is ~27), providing roughly 2.0 standard deviations of buffer to ensure we cover the 180+ unit spikes and resolve the chronic stockout pattern while accepting higher holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: High-demand regime (P20-P25) mean confirmed at 144 units. Chronic stockout rate (46%) persists despite targeting mean, requiring safety buffer (sigma_hat) to be set significantly higher than sample standard deviation to capture recurrent 170-190 unit spikes.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to exhibit a high-demand regime, with the average demand from Period 20 to Period 26 being approximately 141 units (P20: 186, P21: 167, P22: 120, P23: 133, P24: 112, P25: 147, P26: 120). Despite a target service level of 50% (due to equal profit and holding costs of $1), the high frequency of stockouts (nearly 50% of periods) necessitates a robust safety stock buffer. The standard deviation over the last 7 periods is approximately 26, but because the distribution is right-skewed with peaks near 190, the backend's default sigma_hat calculation (based on all historical data) significantly underestimates the required buffer. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand mean (~141) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat at 50. Setting sigma_hat to 50 provides a base stock (141 + 0*50 = 141 when z*=0, but the capped policy adds buffer) that helps handle the 170-190 unit spikes which have recurringly caused stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with a confirmed higher demand regime starting around Period 20 (averaging ~125 units since then, despite a lower recent value of 89 in P27). The chronic stockout history (nearly 50% of periods) indicates that standard mean-based ordering is insufficient due to frequent right-tail spikes (up to 186 units). Although P27 saw lower demand (89), leading to 52 units on-hand, we must maintain a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent future stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (P20-P27 mean is approx 134) and set an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to provide enough safety stock for the persistent 170-190 unit potential spikes observed in the history. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-demand regime that stabilized slightly since Period 20. The average demand from P20-P28 is approximately 132 units, compared to the long-term average of around 108. However, recent periods (P27-P28) show a cooling trend (89 and 115 units), and the cumulative stockout rate is extremely high (~46%). With a lead time of 0 (confirmed by all historical arrivals), the system should ideally satisfy all demand as long as the inventory position covers the current period's realizations. Given Profit = $1 and Holding Cost = $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock targets the median. However, due to the high volatility and frequent stockouts (right-tail spikes like 186 units), the default standard deviation calculation is insufficient. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (capturing the regime since P20) to reflect the mean of ~132, and using an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to provide a safety buffer against the recurrent 140-180+ unit spikes, preventing further stockouts while acknowledging the recent slight dip in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime since P20 remains elevated with a mean of ~132. Recurrent right-tail volatility (max 186) requires a persistent safety buffer (sigma_hat ~45) higher than the sample standard deviation to mitigate the historical 46% stockout rate.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, characterized by a higher-demand regime that began around Period 20 (average ~130 units compared to the long-term average of ~105). Although recent demand in P29 was lower (76 units), historical patterns show aggressive right-tail spikes up to 186 units. With a Profit-to-Holding ratio of 1:1, the OR engine's default service level target is 50%, which has historically led to a high stockout rate (approx. 46%) because the mean demand does not account for these frequent spikes. To mitigate this, I am maintaining a recent_N strategy for mu_hat using N=10 to reflect the current regime (P20-P29 mean is approx 126), and I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 45. This sigma_hat is higher than the recent sample standard deviation, providing necessary safety stock to cover the 170-190 unit spikes and move the actual service level closer to avoiding lost sales during high-demand periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent right-tail spikes. Since the high-demand regime began in Period 20, the average demand has been approximately 125 units (P20-P30), but with periodic peaks reaching 186. The promised lead time remains 0. Currently, the stockout rate is significant (over 40% historically), and although recent periods (P26-P30) have seen better fulfillment, the ending inventory remains low relative to potential spikes. To prevent stockouts during these unpredictable surges, I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 11 periods (P20-P30) to capture the current regime's mean (~125) and maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 45. This sigma_hat is higher than the sample standard deviation to specifically account for the 'fat-tail' risks (spikes > 160) observed in the history, ensuring the base stock level targets ~170 units (Mean + Safety Stock).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in its higher regime established since Period 20, though recent demand (P27-P31) has stabilized somewhat with a mean of 97.6. However, the cumulative stockout rate of 46% remains a concern. The promised lead time (L=0) is consistent. To ensure service levels are met despite frequent right-tail spikes (historically up to 186), I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the elevated post-P20 regime, and maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 45. This sigma_hat reflects the gap between the regime mean (~125) and the frequent peaks (~170) to prevent stockouts that occur when the model under-estimates the volatility of this SKU.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with a baseline mean demand that has shifted upwards since Period 20. Although recent demand (P27-P32) has slightly softened (avg ~98) compared to the intense peak regime (P20-P26 avg ~140), the high historical stockout rate (approx 46%) and the memory of extreme 180+ unit spikes necessitate a persistent safety buffer. The current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent recurring stockouts during potential right-tail spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit), I will use a recent demand window (N=13, covering back to P20) to capture the current regime's higher mean and variance, but I will explicitly set sigma_hat to 45 to ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to cover demand peaks up to approximately 175-180 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization observed P27-P32 (avg ~98) but remains significantly more volatile than the P1-P15 period, warranting continued use of high sigma_hat overrides.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' exhibits high volatility and occasional extreme demand spikes (e.g., 186 in P20, 167 in P21). While recent demand (P27-P33) has stabilized somewhat around a mean of ~98, the memory of high-demand regimes and persistent stockout history (46% previously) dictates a conservative safety stock approach. With lead time L=0, the system must satisfy the current period's demand entirely from on-hand inventory + the order arriving this period. Given the current on-hand inventory of 36, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of 14 periods (covering the high-regime peak and the subsequent stabilization) to capture a representative mean. I continue to use an explicit sigma_hat of 45.0 to ensure the base stock (mu + z*sigma) target is high enough to cover potential right-tail spikes (130-180 units) without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. An explicit sigma_hat provides the necessary buffer that the standard deviation of recent samples alone might underrepresent.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P34) has stabilized to a mean of approximately 97 units, which is lower than the high-demand regime of P20-P25 (~144 units). However, the product history is characterized by extreme right-tail spikes (up to 186 units), and the stockout rate throughout the game has been high (~45%). Given a profit and holding cost of $1 each, the target service level is 50%. Using recent history (N=8) for mu_hat captures the current lower demand level while maintaining responsiveness. For sigma_hat, I will continue to use an explicit override of 45. This value is significantly higher than the standard deviation of recent periods (~13) but is necessary to protect against the recurrent spikes observed throughout the history, effectively shifting the base stock target higher to mitigate the risk of stockouts during unpredictable demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: P27-P34 mean is approx 97 units, significantly lower than the P20-P25 peak regime (~144), but volatility remains a risk factor due to historical erratic spikes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P35) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 98. However, Period 35 resulted in a stockout (demand=104 vs starting inventory=97), which reinforces the carry-over insight that targeting the mean is risky for this SKU due to its inherent volatility. The promised lead time of 0 is reliable. To prevent recurring stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand mean compared to the P20-P25 peak, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 (capturing the stabilized period from P27 onwards) and maintain a high sigma_hat of 45. Using an explicit sigma_hat is necessary because a standard deviation of recent samples (approx 12) would significantly under-equip the inventory for the historically frequent 130+ unit demand spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has entered a more stabilized demand phase. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is 97.4 units, which is significantly lower than the high-demand regime of P20-P26 (avg ~144) but remains unpredictable with right-tail spikes (e.g., P35 demand was 104 units leading to a stockout). Given the 45%+ historical stockout rate and the equal weighting of Profit and Holding Cost ($1 each), the default OR behavior targets a 50% service level (median). To effectively prevent stockouts and improve the service level beyond 50%, the sigma_hat must be set to capture more of the right-tail volatility. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to reflect the current 97.4 unit average. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 35.0; this is higher than the standard deviation of the last 10 periods (~12) to protect against the historical pattern of sudden 130-180 unit spikes that have plagued this SKU throughout the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a stabilization period (P27-P34 avg ~98) followed by a return of high-volatility spikes. Specifically, Period 37 saw a demand of 132, leading to a stockout (on-hand 0 at start of P38). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has a high historical stockout rate (approx 46%) because standard deviation of the mean fails to capture the frequent right-tail spikes of 130-186 units. Given Profit = $1 and Holding = $1, the OR backend's target service level is 50%, which is insufficient for a SKU with this much volatility. To prevent recurrent stockouts, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the current regime which averages ~100-110, but sigma_hat is explicitly set to 45 to protect against the 130+ unit spikes observed in P37 and historically. L remains default (0) as there is no evidence of lead time drift.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Volatility spike confirmed (P37 demand=132); high stockout risk persists whenever demand exceeds 110 units. Safety buffer (sigma_hat) must remain elevated (~45) to mitigate right-tail risk despite low promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with erratic spikes (e.g., P37 demand = 132) occurring even during periods of relative stabilization. In P38, demand was 98, leaving only 2 units on-hand. With a profit and holding cost equal at $1.0, the native OR logic targets a 50% service level (median demand). However, historical data shows a stockout rate of approximately 45% because the demand distribution has a significant right tail (spikes up to 186). Because lead time is 0, the backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - on-hand'. To prevent stockouts during the frequent 130+ unit spikes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 (P27-P38) to capture the current mean (~100 units) and maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 45. This ensures the base_stock (mu_hat + sigma_hat) reaches the ~145-150 range, providing a buffer against the right-tail risks observed in P16, P17, P20, P21, and P37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, demand was 106, resulting in another stockout as on-hand was 100. This reinforces the 'Period 38' carry-over insight that demand frequently exceeds 110 units and stockouts occur even when meeting the 100-unit expectation. The item has a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, implying the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. Given the historical volatility and a historical stockout rate near 45%, I must use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to force a higher safety stock buffer. Recent demand (P33-P39) has averaged approximately 101 units, but with spikes up to 132. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7 periods to reflect the current mean (~101) and set an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to protect against the right-tail spikes seen in P37 and recurring throughout the history. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P40) has stabilized around a mean of 96 units, with a notable drop to 64 in P40. However, the history of this SKU is characterized by extreme right-tail spikes (up to 186) and frequent stockouts (nearly 50% historically). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, which by default targets the median. Given the 'chips(Regular)' category's susceptibility to unpredictable spikes, targeting the mean alone is insufficient. I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of 97 while setting sigma_hat explicitly to 40. This value is significantly higher than the standard deviation of the last 10 periods (~18) but aligns with the 'safety-first' strategy needed to buffer against recurrent 130+ unit demand spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to exhibit extreme right-tail volatility. Period 41 saw a demand spike to 147 units, resulting in another stockout because the previous order was only 61 units (based on mean-targeting). This confirms that a 'mu_hat' based on recent averages (approx 100-110) is consistently insufficient. The lead time L=0 is realized reliably, but to maintain a 50% service level with this level of volatility (ranging from 64 to 147 in just 2 periods), we must set mu_hat closer to the upper quartile and maintain an explicit sigma_hat. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=15 covers the stabilization period since the extreme highs of P20-P25 but still includes enough volatility to influence the mean upwards. I will explicitly set sigma_hat to 45 to provide a safety buffer against the recurrent 130-150 unit spikes observed in P37 and P41.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-stabilization: Period 41 spike (147 units) following a low (64 units) confirms that mean-based ordering is insufficient; a safety buffer (sigma_hat) of at least 45 is required to handle these stochastic 40%+ deviations from the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to exhibit extreme right-tail volatility. Period 42 demand reached 160 units, resulting in a stockout (101 sold, 0 ending on-hand) despite a mean demand over the last 15 periods of approximately 104. The stockout rate remains unacceptably high (~45%). Given profit equals holding cost, the theoretical service level is 50%, but simple mean-based ordering fails because the demand distribution is heavily skewed with frequent spikes exceeding 130-140 units. To address this, mu_hat will be set using the last 7 periods (N=7 covers the recent range of 64 to 160) to capture the current mean of ~114. Crucially, sigma_hat must be set explicitly to 50 to ensure the base stock (mu_hat + sigma_hat) reaches approximately 165 units, providing a buffer against the 150-160 unit spikes observed in P41 and P42. Lead time L=0 is maintained as per historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand volatility reinforced with P42 demand of 160. The 45% cumulative stockout rate confirms that standard deviation from recent samples (~32) is insufficient; an explicit sigma_hat of 50+ is required to buffer against right-tail events.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to exhibit extreme right-tail volatility. Period 41 (147), 42 (160), and 43 (141) have resulted in consecutive stockouts because the demand significantly exceeded the mean-based orders. Despite a promised lead time of 0, the current on-hand inventory is 0. I must set mu_hat based on the most recent high-demand regime (N=4, avg ~147) and maintain an explicit sigma_hat of 55. This elevated sigma_hat is necessary because the standard deviation of recent samples (~7) does not capture the frequent 40-50 unit spikes above the local mean that cause the 45%+ cumulative stockout rate. The goal is to set a base stock level near 200 units (147 + 55) to ensure availability for the next demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Critical demand surge (P41-P43): Average demand increased to 149 units, triggering three consecutive stockouts. Cumulative stockout rate remains stuck at ~45%, confirming that safety stock must buffer for periodic demand peaks of 160-180 units even when lead time is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-volatility environment for 'chips(Regular)'. Although the promised lead time is 0, recent demand (P41-P44) has shown significant surges (147, 160, 141, 118), leading to three consecutive stockouts between P41 and P43. The carry-over insights confirm a historical stockout rate of approx 45%, suggesting that relying on the sample mean and standard deviation is insufficient for this SKU's right-tail risks. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (10 units). To maximize reward and prevent further stockouts in the final periods of the game (P45-P50), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (approx 141 units) to capture the current elevated demand level. Most importantly, I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 55. This value is intentionally set higher than the recent sample standard deviation to provide a robust safety buffer against the intermittent 160+ unit spikes observed in the history (e.g., P20, P21, P42). Setting L to 'calculate' confirms the 0-period lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Sustained high-demand volatility (P41-P44 average 141.5) with frequent stockouts (P41-P43) necessitates an explicit safety buffer (sigma_hat=55) to capture right-tail demand events (160+ units) which the standard deviation of all samples underestimates.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P41-P45) shows a higher mean (~138) compared to the long-term average, with significant right-tail volatility (peak 160). Period 44 and 45 show a stabilization around 118-124 units, but the high stockout frequency throughout the game (approx 45%) indicates that mean-based safety stock is insufficient. Given Profit=Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the median; however, to prevent stockouts against the 160+ unit spikes seen in P42, mu_hat must be set to the recent elevated mean (N=5 gives ~138) and sigma_hat must remain explicitly high (55) to provide a sufficient buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P41-P46) remains elevated and volatile, with an average of approximately 134 units, including peaks up to 160 units. While demand in P44-P46 has slightly stabilized (avg 118), the historical stockout rate (approx 45%) and the occurrence of extreme spikes (e.g., 186 in P20, 160 in P42) necessitate a significant safety buffer. With Profit and Holding cost both equal to $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which theoretically suggests ordering the mean. However, given the skewed right-tail risk and frequent stockouts when demand exceeds the mean, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (avg ~134) and maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to ensure we carry enough inventory to cover potential 170+ unit spikes. This balances the high risk of lost sales against the linear holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand dropped significantly to 53 units, leaving 81 units on hand. The recent high-demand regime (P41-P46) averaged ~134 units with extreme peaks (160), necessitating a high safety stock. Although P47 was low, history shows that this SKU's volatility typically manifests as sharp spikes following periods of replenishment. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to prevent stockouts from any final demand surge while not over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs on the final inventory. I will maintain mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (approx 108 units) to balance the recent high-demand surge with the latest low data point, and keep sigma_hat at 50 to protect against the high right-tail risk (spikes of 140-160+) observed frequently in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the SKU exhibits a pattern of high volatility. After a significant surge in periods 41-45 (average demand ~141), demand has cooled in periods 47 (53) and 48 (65). However, historical data shows that low-demand periods are frequently followed by right-tail spikes (160+ units). The cumulative stockout rate remains high (~45%). Despite the current 'On-hand' inventory of 58, the the safety stock must be set to account for sudden spikes. I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering the recent high and low mix) to capture a representative mean of ~100-110. Crucially, I am maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 55.0 to ensure the base stock reaches approximately 160-170 units, protecting against the recurring extreme demand events seen in the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand volatility remains the primary risk; while recent two periods (P47-P48) were low, previous patterns show high-demand spikes (140-160+) occur unpredictably. Maintaining explicit safety stock buffer is essential to improve the ~45% historical service level.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we conclude a long-term strategy for chips(Regular). The history shows that this SKU is characterized by extreme demand volatility, with frequent 'right-tail' spikes (e.g., P42: 160, P20: 186) occurring even after low-demand periods. The promised lead time is 0 and has remained consistent. However, the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the default backend logic targets a 50% service level. Historically, this has resulted in a critical stockout rate (approx 45%) because the 50th percentile of demand is much lower than the peaks we must buffer against to succeed. After a recent surge (P41-P46), demand has cooled in the last three periods (P47-P49 avg: 70.3), but volatility knowledge dictates we cannot lower parameters too aggressively. To protect against a final-period spike and maximize total reward, I am setting mu_hat to be slightly higher than the recent 5-period average (90) and maintaining an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to capture those historical high-impact peaks (140-160+).
