  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I am starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The provided historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. This gives an average historical demand of 118 units per period, though the most recent period saw a significant spike to 177. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize profit and meet the expected demand of approximately 120-130 units (balancing the historical mean with the recent spike), I will place an order. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), I must be careful not to over-order and carry excessive inventory, but I must also avoid stockouts in Period 1.

I will target the median demand (approx. 90-95 units) to balance the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost. Given the recent spike, I will lean slightly higher toward 100 to mitigate potential momentum in demand, while respecting that any units unsold after today will zero out the profit earned from units sold.",
