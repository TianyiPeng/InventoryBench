Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no history to analyze yet. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples provided are [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], which show an upward trend and significant variability (mean ~118, std ~38). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, selecting N=5 to encompass the provided samples while allowing the OR backend to quickly adapt as new periods conclude. Since the promised lead time is 0, the 'default' method for L is appropriate for now.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 180 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming the promised lead time of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 74. Historical demand samples are [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], but actual Period 1 demand was 106. The mean of the seed samples is around 118. Considering the recent sample of 106 and the trend in the provided data, there isn't enough evidence yet for a major regime shift (only 1 actual period observed). I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while staying close to the historical mean. L will remain at the promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2020.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, we observed demand of 106 and 111. The historical demand samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a mean around 118, while the actual realization in P1 and P2 is slightly lower (avg 108.5). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture a balanced view of the historical data and recent performance, acknowledging that Period 5 in the history showed a significant spike (177) which we should be prepared for. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=5 to ensure we account for that high variance observed in the historical Period 5. This approach generates a base stock that covers immediate demand plus a safety buffer for potential spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1965.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained very stable over the first three periods, with values of 106, 111, and 107. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the demand is stable and shows no signs of seasonal shifts or regime changes, I will use all available historical data (N=3) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current and lead-time periods (1+0=1 period total). The on-hand inventory is 68, and the backend will place an order to bring the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) up to the calculated base stock level to satisfy Period 4 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked to 138, exceeding the available inventory (113 units) and resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The product is 'chips(Regular)' and historical demand in the first three periods was relatively stable (106, 111, 107), but the most recent period shows a potential upward shift. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand increase, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the volatility of the spike while maintaining some baseline average. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period alone.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked significantly to 138, exceeding on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. In Period 5, demand returned to a more typical level of 103. Analysis of the historical demand (80, 120, 120, 93, 177 from the data block, and 106, 111, 107, 138, 103 from the game history) reveals a mean of approximately 115.5 units. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is required to avoid stockouts like the one in Period 4. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (N=5) to reflect the recent variability while maintaining enough stock to cover the review period plus lead time (1+0=1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 consistently (the order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). Demand history shows significant fluctuation: Period 1-5 mean demand was ~113, while Period 6 saw a sharp drop to 42. Since there is no specific calendar context or product description to explain this drop, I will use a balanced forecast. I'll use recent_N with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the overall average while acknowledging the recent volatility, and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on the full historical variability. L is set to calculate as it confirms lead time 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1503.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 1 to Period 7 confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been somewhat volatile, ranging from 42 to 138. The mean demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 98.6. We saw a significant dip in Period 6 (demand=42), but Period 7 returned to a more normal level (83). Given the profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period performance. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent history while being responsive to the observed variance, including the stockout in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1732.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after some volatility in Periods 4 and 6. The last 8 periods show a mean demand of 110.5, but there was a significant drop in Period 6 (42 units) followed by a recovery. Excluding the outlier in Period 6, the average is closer to 106. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory currently stands at 54 units on-hand with zero in-transit. To ensure we meet demand while accounting for recent variability, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5 to capture the recovery post-Period 6) and sigma_hat (N=5 to reflect recent volatility). This should maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which target a service level of approximately 95%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1790.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after early volatility. The mean demand across Periods 1-9 is approximately 98 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 53 units, and there are no units in transit. Since L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock to cover Period 10's demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to confirm the 0-period trend and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most stable recent data (average demand over P5-P9 is ~84, but excluding the outlier low of 42 in P6, it sits around 95); using N=5 includes that dip, which provides a safer conservative cushion for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation while prioritizing the most recent demand regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with minor fluctuations. The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 93.4 units, with a notable drop in Period 10 (53 units) and Period 6 (42 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met as evidenced by all orders (P1-P10) arriving in the same period they were ordered. Since there are no seasonal dates or product-specific triggers, I will use a medium-term average (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution while smoothing out the volatility seen in periods 6 and 10. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 11 periods. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods (ordered and arrived within the same period), matching the promised lead time. Demand in the most recent 5 periods (Periods 7-11) shows a mean of approximately 84.8 units compared to the overall historical mean (periods 1-11) of 93.3 units. Period 4's stockout was recovered, and inventory levels are currently sufficient (on-hand 43). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior, which is slightly lower and less volatile than the early periods. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by all concluded periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1564.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 92.9 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 84 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 units in transit. Given the profit margin of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (approx 95%). I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the established variance. L will remain at the default (0) as lead time is stable.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 6, following an initial higher-demand phase. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 14, I am using a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture the demand mean and standard deviation from the more stable regime (Periods 6-13). During periods 6 through 13, the average demand was approximately 79.1 units. This approach filters out the higher volatility and demand levels observed in the first 5 periods while maintaining a sufficient sample size for statistical significance. With L=0, the target base stock aims to cover the current period's demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 6; current average demand is approximately 79 units per period compared to 113 in Periods 1-5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1647.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 6. Calculating the mean demand from Period 6 through Period 14 (inclusive) gives an average of approximately 79.7 units per period. The standard deviation during this same stable period is approximately 18.2 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. For Period 15, on-hand inventory is 25 units. Since L=0, the base stock should cover (1+L) periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (Periods 6-14) to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent data ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the higher demand seen in Periods 1-5, while maintaining an appropriate safety stock for the current volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted after Period 5. From Period 6 to Period 15 (10 samples), the mean demand is 79.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime and avoid the higher demand noise from Periods 1-5. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2090.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 132 units, which exceeded on-hand inventory and resulted in lost sales. This spike follows a period of stability where demand averaged approximately 79 units (Periods 6-15). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while balancing the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1), I need to adjust the demand forecast upwards temporarily until it's clear if Period 16 was an outlier or a shift. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the shift from Period 6 onwards including the recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to account for the increased volatility introduced by the Period 16 demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 16 (132 units), breaking the previous stable regime of ~79 units. Monitoring for a new higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for Period 16 and Period 17 was consistently 132 units, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~79 units. The system inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the last two periods. To recover, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this new regime (N=2) to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to meet this elevated demand. The lead time L is consistently 0 (arrived in the same period), so L remains 'default'. Standard deviation is calculated over the last 2 periods; however, since demand was identical (132, 132), the calculated std is 0. To provide a safety buffer for volatility, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat based on the historical volatility of this SKU (approx 20 units).

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: demand constant at 132 units for 2 consecutive periods (+67% from previous mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1455.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand dropped to 81 units after two periods of 132 units, suggesting the 'break' observed in Period 16/17 might have been a temporary spike rather than a permanent regime shift. However, looking at the history, demand appears highly volatile. The previous 'stable' mean was ~79. Periods 16-18 have an average of 115. Using a broader recent window (N=5: Periods 14-18) captures the transition and volatility, giving a mean of 102.2. Given that 81 is very close to the old mean of 79, I will use recent_N=5 to avoid overreacting to the 132 spike while acknowledging that demand has not returned to the low 40-50 range. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on hand is 84, with 0 in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: The demand spike in Periods 16-17 (132 units) retreated in Period 18 (81 units), suggesting high local volatility rather than a sustained 132-unit regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1952.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has been highly volatile. Periods 16 and 17 saw a spike to 132 units, followed by a drop to 81 (Period 18) and a moderate rise to 105 (Period 19). The previous average (Periods 6-15) was approximately 80. The recent 4-period average (Periods 16-19) is 112.5. Given this instability, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent upward shift in mean and volatility caused by the 'spike-then-moderate' pattern. L remains 0 as consistently observed in history. The profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), so the OR backend will target a high service level (quantile \u2248 0.95), which is prudent given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 16-17.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 16; mean demand for P16-P19 is ~113 units vs ~80 units in P6-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2907.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand spiked to 186 units, following a sequence of high volatility starting at Period 16 (132, 132, 81, 105, 186). The 'stable' regime of ~79 units observed between P6-P15 has clearly ended. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 127.2 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (186 demand vs 153 supply), I need to aggressively adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher mean and significantly increased variance. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this new volatile regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/volatility confirmed: Average demand for P16-P20 is 127.2 units, a 61% increase from the P6-P15 average of 79.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3148.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are navigating a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) has been 132, 132, 81, 105, 186, and 167, averaging 133.8 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~79 units (P6-P15). Period 20 and 21 saw particularly high demand (186 and 167), leading to a stockout in P20 and a low ending inventory of 25 in P21. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. To respond to this heightened demand and increased volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current regime's characteristics (P16-P21). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent 133.8 mean and the higher standard deviation observed during this spike, aimed at preventing further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $19.0 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-21 average demand is 133.8 units (+69% vs P6-P15 average of 79.1). Volatility has also increased significantly within this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2202.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand data from Period 16 to Period 22 (7 periods), the average demand is 131.86 units (calculated from: 132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120), with a high standard deviation suggesting increased volatility (~34.5). This is a stark increase from the Period 6 to Period 15 average of ~79 units. Current on-hand inventory is 78 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistently met (actual lead time observed in history is 0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this new high-demand, high-volatility regime. I will keep L at 'default' since the 0-period lead time is performing as expected.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed demand regime shift sustained for 7 periods (P16-P22); mean demand increased to 131.9 units (+67% vs previous regime) with significantly higher volatility (std ~34.5).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 through Period 23 (8 samples), the average demand is 132.0 units, which is a 67% increase over the previous stable mean of ~79 units (Periods 6-15). The volatility has also increased substantially, with demand ranging from 81 to 186 in this recent window. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'arrived during same period' conclusions. I will use a recent_N method with N=8 to capture this higher mean and elevated variance for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels align with the current high-demand environment while balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P23): mean demand 132.0 units (+67% vs prior), std ~32.1. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new high-demand regime since Period 16. In the nine periods since this shift (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 129.8 units, significantly higher than the 79.1 units observed in the previous stable regime (P6-P15). There is also noticeable volatility (standard deviation of ~31.1 in this window), including a peak of 186 units in Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally target a high service level (0.95 quantile). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this current high-demand, high-variance regime, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters reflect the most recent sustained changes without being diluted by the older, lower-demand history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 25 (the last 10 periods), the average demand is approximately 131.5 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average of ~80 units. In Period 25, demand was 147 units, slightly above this recent average but within the higher volatility observed in this regime (standard deviation ~31). The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this sustained higher demand and volatility, I will use a window of N=10 for both mu_hat (expected demand for Period 26) and sigma_hat (to capture the recent volatility). This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the 130+ unit mean while maintaining a sufficient safety stock buffer to meet the 95% service level goal, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-25 confirmed: Mean = 131.5 units, Std Dev \u2248 31.0. This represents a sustained 65% increase in demand compared to the Period 6-15 baseline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), demand has averaged 130.6. Though volatility is present (std ~28.6 in this window), the mean is significantly higher than the P6-P15 baseline of ~79. Performance history shows lead time consistently remains 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this higher mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base-stock level accounts for this sustained shift. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it consistently reflects 0 in the history.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a higher-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the mean demand is approximately 127.3 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28.5. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 89 units, which is a dip compared to the regime average but within expected volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 27 conclude' message (ordered P27, arrived P27). I will continue using a window of N=12 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the significantly lower-demand data from Periods 6-15. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current 60%+ increase in mean demand and the associated increase in variance.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-volume regime that started around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the mean demand is approximately 126.3 units with a standard deviation of about 26.6 units. This is significantly higher than the Period 6-15 average of ~79 units. Recent periods (P27 and P28) showed relatively lower demand (89 and 115) compared to the mid-20s peak, but still comfortably within the range of this high-volume regime. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use a window of the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that prevents stockouts in this higher-demand environment while acknowledging the current volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a higher-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 126.3 with a standard deviation of 29.8. However, there has been a slight softening in the last three periods (P27-P29: 89, 115, 76), creating an average of 93.3 for that small window. Despite this, the overall regime remains higher than the P6-P15 baseline (79.1). I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while acknowledging the recent softer data points. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all history up to Period 29. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the higher volatility (z* \u2248 1.84 given profit $19 and holding cost $1) while preventing excessive stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-29 confirmed: Mean = 126.3 units, Std Dev \u2248 29.8. Recent three periods (P27-P29) show a slight softening to 93.3 units, but volatility remains present.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. Starting at Period 16, a higher-demand regime emerged, but recent periods (P27-P30) have seen a slight decrease in the average (avg: 96.25 units) compared to the Period 16-26 average (avg: 131 units). However, the standard deviation remains high, and the most recent demand (P30: 105 units) suggests demand still fluctuates well above the P6-P15 baseline (avg: 79 units). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle this volatility while being responsive to the potential softening of the high-demand regime, I will use a recent window (N=15) covering the period since the major shift (P16 onwards). This captures the current regime's higher mean and variance while adapting to the latest data points. The service level provided by the OR backend (q ~ 0.95) remains appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1889.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 120 units in the current high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. Recent periods (P27-P31) show demand values of 89, 115, 76, 105, and 103, resulting in a 5-period average of 97.6, which is lower than the P16-P26 average (~131). However, historical patterns suggest high volatility where demand can spike back up suddenly. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all orders have arrived within the same period. For Period 32, I will use a recent window (N=16) for mu_hat to capture the broader high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards (mean ~116) while respecting recent softening. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=16 to account for the significantly increased variance observed since Period 16, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to cover potential spikes while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-31 remains volatile: Mean \u2248 117 units, Std Dev \u2248 29.5. Recent 5-period average (P27-P31) has softened to 97.6 units, but frequent spikes prevent lowering the forecast too aggressively.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has been characterized by high volatility and a higher mean compared to the Period 6-15 baseline. While there was a recent softening in Periods 27-29, the demand has stabilized back around the 100-110 units range in the last three periods (P30: 105, P31: 103, P32: 111). The rolling 17-period average (P16-P32) is approximately 120 units with a standard deviation of 28. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts while managing the increased volatility. I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this entire 'high volatility' regime starting at Period 16. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to assume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1553.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P27-P33), the mean demand is 97.9 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. This is lower than the peak mean observed between P16-P26 (~131 units) but remains significantly more variable and higher than the original baseline (P6-P15). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1) against the recent softening in demand, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the start of the volatile regime in P16 to the present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full breadth of the current high-volatility environment while including the recent lower demand outcomes to prevent excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P33 remains in a high-volatility state compared to P6-P15, though recent mean (P27-P33) has softened to ~98 units from the previous ~131 peak.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. While the absolute peaks of ~131 units seen in the Period 16-25 window have softened slightly, the recent demand (Periods 27-34) remains unpredictable with a mean of approximately 96.4 units and frequent fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage this volatility and avoid stockouts (as seen in earlier periods when demand spiked), I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the current high-volatility regime average (~109 units per period) while allowing for the recent softening. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 15 periods to appropriately reflect the increased variance observed since Period 16. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the lower recent mean and the persistent risk of spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P27-P34 has softened to a mean of ~96.4 units, but remains part of a high-volatility era compared to the stable P6-P15 period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a moderately volatile regime since Period 27, moving away from the extreme peaks seen in Periods 16-25. For the last 9 periods (P27-P35), the mean demand is 97.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 12.3. This is significantly lower and more stable than the ~131 units seen previously, though still higher than the early baseline (P6-P15) of ~79 units. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the history of same-period arrivals, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this specific softened regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects current demand levels while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility, thus optimizing the balance between stockout risk and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27-35 has stabilized at a lower mean of 97.2 units (Std Dev ~12.3) compared to the Period 16-26 peak of 131.5 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 27. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is 96.4 units with a standard deviation of 11.9. This is a significant decrease from the heightened volatility and peaks observed between Periods 16-26 (mean ~131). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level targets remain high. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime while maintaining enough inventory to prevent stockouts during occasional fluctuations. L is left at default (0) as actual lead time consistently matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27-36 has stabilized at a mean of 96.4 units (Std Dev ~11.9), significantly lower than the P16-P26 peak of 131.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 37 spiked to 132 units, exactly matching the peak levels seen in the Period 16-26 high-demand regime. This broke the recent stable period (P27-P36) where demand averaged ~96 units. Because on-hand inventory was fully depleted in Period 37 (ending inventory 0), there is a significant risk of a sustained upward shift or continued high volatility akin to the P16 era. To prevent stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering P27-P37) to capture the recent stability while incorporating the new spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 37 (132 units), identical to the Period 16-26 peak levels. This follows a 10-period stable regime (P27-P36) of ~96 units. Monitoring for a return to the high-volatility/high-mean regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked to 132 units, mirroring the high-demand volatility seen in Periods 16-26. Period 38 saw a moderation to 98 units. The 'carry_over_insight' tracking indicates we are currently in a transition or high-volatility phase following a stable 10-period regime (~96 units). Since the profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), the service level target is roughly 95%, making it critical to buffer against these 130+ unit spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 (covering the Period 27-38 window) to capture the base demand of ~100 while allowing the sigma_hat (also recent_N=12) to reflect the significant increase in variance caused by the Period 37 spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1995.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a recent shift from a stable regime of ~96 units (P27-P36) back into a higher-volatility phase triggered at P37 (demand=132). The demand for P38 was 98 and P39 was 106. The mean for the most recent 4 periods (P36-P39) is 106.25, while the mean for the broader high-volatility window starting at P16 is approximately 115 units. Given the critical 0-period lead time, we must maintain sufficient stock to capture spikes without excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is low (19 units). I will use the recent 14 periods (P26-P39) to balance the stable softening observed earlier with the current uptick and volatility. This period's inventory calculation (base_stock) will target approximately 110-120 units total. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated as of Period 37; while P27-P36 averaged ~96 units, the recent three periods (P37-P39) average 112 units, confirming a return to less predictable demand patterns.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase. While the period 27-36 mean was approximately 96 units, the more recent window (P37-P40) show significant swings (132, 98, 106, 64), resulting in a mean of 100 units but with high variance. The stockout in P37 suggests that staying reactive to spikes is necessary. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N with N=14 (covering P27-P40) to balance the stable baseline of ~96 with the recent volatility of ~100. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=14) to capture this increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated as of Period 37: while the P27-P36 baseline was ~96 units, recent levels (P37-P40) show high variance (std ~28) despite a similar mean (100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2394.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility. Period 41 saw a significant demand spike of 147 units, causing a stockout. Since Period 37, demand has fluctuated between 64 and 147 units, with a mean of approximately 109.4 units and a standard deviation around 31. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that we have exited the stable Period 27-36 regime (~96 units) and returned to a higher-variance state similar to Period 16-26. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this increased volatility and the recent spike, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 37-41) to capture this latest demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 41 demand spike (147 units) confirmed a shift away from the stable P27-P36 regime. Recent 5-period mean (P37-41) is 109.4 units with high variance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 37. The last five periods (P38-P42) show values of 98, 106, 64, 147, and 160. This reflects a significant upward trend and increased variance compared to the stable P27-P36 period (avg ~96). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P37-P42) is 117.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 34. To ensure high service levels given the recent spikes (147 and 160) and low current on-hand inventory (3 units), I will use the recent N=6 method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened demand and volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime confirmed starting P37: P37-P42 average demand increased to 117.8 units with high variance (Std Dev ~34.3), including recent peaks of 147 and 160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2643.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 37, characterized by high volatility and an increased mean. The demand in the last three periods (P41-P43) was 147, 160, and 141 units, respectively, which is substantially higher than the earlier baseline (~96 units) and even higher than the previous peak regime (~132 units). The recent 7-period average (P37-P43) is approximately 121.1 units with a standard deviation of 31.8. To capture this recent sustained high-demand/high-volatility behavior without over-indexing on the very last spike, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current mean of ~121 units and the significant variance (Std Dev ~32), which is necessary to avoid stockouts during this volatile period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the concluded order history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 37 confirmed as high-volatility/high-mean: P37-P43 average is 121.1 units with a standard deviation of ~31.8, including three consecutive periods (P41-P43) over 140 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2183.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 37 is confirmed as high-mean and high-volatility. The average demand from Period 37 to 44 is approximately 120.8 units with a substantial standard deviation, including several spikes above 140 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P41-P44) have averaged 141.5 units, though Period 44 saw a slight softening to 118. To account for this sustained but volatile high-demand state, I am using a recent window (N=8) to capture the current regime's characteristics (P37-P44). This balanced approach allows the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the elevated mean while maintaining a safety buffer for the frequent spikes, minimizing stockout risk in this high-margin (Profit $19) vs low-holding-cost ($1) environment. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the game history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility/high-mean regime P37-P44: Mean 120.8 units, Std Dev ~30. Recent 4-period mean (P41-P44) is 141.5 units, indicating persistent upward pressure despite the P44 drop.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) from Period 37 to Period 45 remains in a high-volatility, high-mean state. The mean demand for this segment is 121.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. Recent periods (P41-P45) have been particularly strong, with an average of 138 units, though Period 44 and 45 show a slight tapering (118 and 124 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is approximately 95%, making it critical to protect against the frequent spikes (up to 160 units) seen recently. I will use recent_N with N=9 (the length of the current high-volatility regime starting at P37) to capture both the elevated mean and the significant variance. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which simplifies the pipeline inventory management, but the high variance requires a robust base stock to avoid stockouts. Current on-hand is low (48), so a significant order is expected to reach the desired safety level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volatility, high-mean state spanning Period 37 to the present. The average demand for the period P37-P46 is approximately 119.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 28.5 units. This is a significant increase compared to the mid-game baseline (P27-P36) of ~96 units. Recent periods (P42-P46) show sustained high demand (160, 141, 118, 124, 113) averaging 131.2 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use the recent 10 periods (P37-P46) to project demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) for the OR backend, as this covers the current regime shift while capturing the increased variability. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the risk of spikes like those seen in P41 and P42.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P37-P46 confirmed high-volatility: Mean 119.3, Std Dev 28.5. This follows the lower-demand P27-P36 regime (Mean 96.4) and mimics the high-demand peaks observed in P16-P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $894.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility/high-mean regime starting at Period 37, similar to the pattern seen in Periods 16-26. While Period 47 saw a significant drop to 53 units, this follows a long stretch (P41-P46) where demand averaged ~134 units with several peaks near or above 150 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts during potential spikes. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=11 (covering the current high-volatility regime from P37 to P47). Although demand dropped in P47, N=11 ensures the forecast is anchored in the overall higher mean (~113) and high variance (Std Dev ~32) of this period, providing a necessary buffer against immediate rebounds in demand while approaching the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1131.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has been characterized by high volatility (mean ~114, std ~32). However, the last two periods (P47, P48) have shown a significant drop to 53 and 65 units respectively, down from the 110-160 range seen in P41-P46. This could signal a transition back to a lower-demand period or simply persistent high variance. Given we are at Period 49 (near the end of the simulation at P50), and on-hand inventory is relatively high (104 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full scope of the high-volatility era starting from P37. This balances the recent low observations against the established high-mean regime to ensure sufficient service level without over-ordering as the simulation concludes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in P47-P48 (avg 59 units) following a high-demand peak (P41-P46 avg 133.8 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1693.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 50, the demand context shows a recent softening after a high-volatility peak. Period 49 demand was 93 units, which aligns with a gradual recovery from the very low demand observed in Periods 47-48 (53 and 65 units). The high-volatility regime starting Period 37 remains the primary risk factor, but the immediate trend represents a cooling off from the P41-P43 peaks. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering back to P37) to capture the average of the current high-volatility era (mean ~107), and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the significant variance observed. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. This approach maintains a safe base stock level to protect against potential spikes while acknowledging the recent lower demand levels.
