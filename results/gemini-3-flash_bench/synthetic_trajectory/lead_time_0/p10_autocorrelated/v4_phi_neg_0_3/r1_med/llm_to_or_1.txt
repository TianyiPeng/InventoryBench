Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. Demand history for the first five periods (provided in the prompt) shows an upward trend (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), though we only observe Period 1 demand (74) in the current context. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no inventory and no history of lead-time variance yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (0) and estimate demand based on the initial samples. The mean of the 5 samples provided is 100.4. Given the upward trend ending at 134, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the more recent volume (avg of 88, 98, 134 is 106.67), but the backend uses (1+L)*mean. I'll set L to default and use recent_N for both mu and sigma to adapt quickly to the provided sample statistics.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 120 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand was 98 units, leaving 22 on-hand. Historical demand (P1-P5 from prompt and the actual P1 observation) shows: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134, and 98. The mean of these 6 samples is 100. Since we have very few samples and no clear regime shift yet, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility (98, 134, 98, 88, 108). With profit=$4 and holding=$1, the target service level is 0.8. Using L=0 and calculating mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (avg ~105) ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the expected demand after our current on-hand of 22 is consumed.

Daily Profit: $332.00, Daily Holding Cost: $37.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (both orders in P1 and P2 arrived the same period they were placed). The demand for the first two periods (98, 83) and the sample data (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) suggests a relatively stable but volatile demand pattern. The mean of the historical samples and actual demand so far indicates an average demand around 97 units per period. Since lead time is 0, the review period + lead time is 1 period (L+1). Current on-hand is 37 units with nothing in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (including the 5 history samples and 2 actual observations) to capture the current mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

=== Period 3 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=78, arrived=78 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=115, demand=136, sold=115, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $460.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand spiked significantly to 136, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 115. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility (Period 1-5: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134; conclude history: 98, 83, 136). The average demand over the last three concludes is 105.6. Since we stock out frequently and demand seems to be trending upward or at least remains highly variable, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent volatility and higher mean. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, so L=0 remains appropriate. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 samples, we aim to increase the base stock level to prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). Historical demand samples are 98, 83, 136, and 91 (Mean: 102, Std Dev: 23.4). In Period 3, we experienced a stockout because demand (136) exceeded the starting inventory (115), despite the 0-lead-time arrival. Currently, on-hand inventory is 38. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. To cover Period 5 demand, the base stock should be calculated using the recent historical mean and variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistent with observations (all orders from P1-P5 arrived in the same period they were ordered). Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 98, 83, 136, 91, and 76, which averages 96.8 units per period. The user-provided prompt also includes separate historical samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) with an average of 100.4. Combining all data points (10 samples), the mean is approximately 98.6. There is a slight peak in Period 3 (demand=136), but no sustained regime shift is yet evident. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. Setting L=0 as observed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent volatility (the last 5 periods concluded: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76), which averages 96.8. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to account for the variance seen in these recent periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Demand for the first 6 periods has been 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, and 115, averaging 99.8. I am also incorporating the 5 historical samples provided (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), which average 100.4. Combining all 11 data points, the global mean is roughly 100 and the standard deviation is approximately 21. No significant trend or seasonal cycle is yet apparent in this 'Period_X' labeling. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) with 0 in-transit. Since L=0, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (assuming Profit=$4, Holding=$1, which gives a cycle service level of 80%) will order up to meet demand within this same period. I will use 'default' for L (0) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available samples (N=11) to capture the stable but volatile demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variability over the last 7 periods, with a mean around 93 units and a standard deviation of approximately 26. In Period 7, demand dropped significantly to 52, while Period 6 was high at 115. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders have consistently arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There are currently no in-transit units and 66 units on-hand. To ensure a high service level (requested q = 0.8) while accounting for the recent low demand in P7 and higher demand in P6, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full cycle of recent volatility while prioritizing recent patterns. Setting L to default (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1-8 confirms that orders placed in Period N arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance. The mean demand over the first 8 periods (98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98) is 93.6, while the recent 3 periods (115, 52, 98) average 88.3. I will utilize a recent window of N=5 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture the current demand volatility while maintaining responsiveness to the zero lead time dynamic. On-hand inventory is currently 18, so the OR engine will calculate the necessary order size to cover Period 9's demand using the base stock policy (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern with an average of approximately 94.6 units per period across the historical data (Periods 1-9) and 95.8 units over the seeding data (Period 1-5). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as the dates are generic. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (10 units on-hand), and since lead time is 0, the backend should order based on today's expected demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the observed behavior while filtering out the initialization phase. The service level to be targeted by the OR backend is 0.8 (Profit $4 / ($4+$1)), which is handled automatically by providing accurate mu and sigma estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without a clear trend or regime shift. The mean demand observed in the history is 92.8 units (98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98, 97, 82). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no significant evidence of a changepoint in demand volume or lead time reliability, I will use 'default' or 'calculate' methods to capture the full historical context. For mu_hat, using the 'default' method will estimate demand based on all available samples (1+0)*92.8. Current inventory is 32 units, and with L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock to cover the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent mean of approximately 93.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21.9 units across the 11 historical periods of gameplay, plus the 5 pre-game samples provided. Lead time is consistently 0 (arriving in the same period as ordered). In Period 11, the closing inventory was low (4 units) due to a demand of 110. To minimize the risk of a stockout while managing holding costs, I will use a recent demand window to calculate parameters. The recent_N method with N=11 (all game history) captures the actual live demand volatility better than the total sample set. With L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (1+0) periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a stockout with demand reaching 150 units, while ending on-hand inventory is currently 0. Reviewing the history (Period 1-12), the mean demand is 103.17 with a standard deviation of 26.65. However, there's a recent upward trend in volatility and volume, specifically with the jump to 150 in Period 12. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To prevent further stockouts while responding to the recent spike, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand environment (Periods 8-12: mean=107.4, but including high volatility). Setting L=0 explicitly as it is the observed stable lead time. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base_stock that targets a 0.8 service level (4/(4+1)), but the capped order logic will ensure we don't over-order excessively if the 150 was an outlier.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility over the first 13 periods, ranging from 52 up to 150 units. The most recent demand (Period 13) was 77, following a peak of 150 in Period 12. There is no clear trending or seasonal pattern in the numbering of periods. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 completed periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting (N=13, which is the total available history after the seed data) to capture the overall mean and variance while giving priority to the observed game history over the initial seed samples. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will naturally aim for a higher service level (approximately 80%), which is appropriate for a snack category where stockouts result in direct lost profit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-14) shows a mean of 99.7 units per period. In the last three periods (12-14), demand has been more volatile (150, 77, 127), averaging 118 units. Given the high stockout frequency (Periods 3, 12, 14), I need to set parameters that maintain a slightly higher service level. The actual lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), so L=0 is correct. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the recent higher demand peaks, and an explicit sigma to account for the observed volatility which caused the recent stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. The demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 15 periods average: 99.8). Recent demand has shown some volatility but no distinct regime shift. Looking at the last 5 samples (110, 150, 77, 127, 103), the mean is around 113, which is slightly higher than the overall average. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), we want a base stock level that targets an 80% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this slight upward trend while maintaining 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures we maintain sufficient stock to cover the 1-period demand cycle (L+1 = 1) while minimizing the risk of holding too much inventory.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility with no distinct seasonal shift or regime change. Period 16 demand was lower than average (65), while Period 15 was 103 and Period 14 was 127. The historical mean of all observations is approximately 97.7, and the standard deviation is around 26.5. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (the order arrives in the same period it is placed), I will maintain L=0. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to prioritize recent demand patterns (Periods 7-16) over the initial seed data, as this provides a stable but relatively updated look at the demand mean and volatility which currently averages around 96 with a standard deviation of 28. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost while accounting for the same-day delivery characteristic.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since the beginning, with an average demand of approximately 101 units per period and a standard deviation of about 25 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 17 concluded periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units) because the Period 17 sales (118) nearly depleted the available stock. Since L=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period 18 to satisfy Period 18 demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while maintaining stability, setting the OR backend to target a base stock based on approximately 101 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (around 80%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Historical data from Period 1 to Period 18 shows that the lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Demand has shown some volatility, with a mean around 100 units, but recent periods (P12, P14, P17, P18) have frequently resulted in stockouts, suggesting that the inventory levels are occasionally insufficient to cover spikes (e.g., 150, 133 units). To ensure high service levels and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent demand trends more accurately, while maintaining the lead time at 0 ('default') as it has been stable.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. Historical data from periods 1-19 shows a stable demand pattern with no clear trend or seasonal peaks, although volatility is present (range 52-150). The mean demand over the last 19 periods is approximately 101 units, while the last 5 periods (P15-P19) average 96.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand distribution while smoothing out extreme single-period fluctuations (like the demands of 133 and 65 in P18 and P19). Lead time 'L' will remain at 'default' (0) as it is reliable. The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand and a safety buffer (z-score approx 0.84 based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost), then subtract the current 64 units on-hand to determine the order quantity.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 20 periods, the average demand is approximately 101 units, with significant volatility (standard deviation ~26). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, the system has frequently run out of stock (Periods 3, 12, 14, 18, 20), indicating that the current base-stock levels are slightly too lean given the high demand variance. I am using recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility accurately. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that better accounts for the observed standard deviation while maintaining the lead time at 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively consistent with an average of approximately 101 units per period over the first 21 periods. However, recent demand (periods 18-21) has shown higher volatility and a slight upward trend, with values of 133, 65, 130, and 121. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0). To account for the recent increase in demand and its variability while keeping inventory lean to manage the $1.0 holding cost against a $4.0 profit (critical ratio ~0.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mean and standard deviation. This captures the more recent demand regime (avg ~103) while smoothing out the noise from the last few erratic periods. Given that the current on-hand inventory is only 2 units, the OR backend needs these parameters to trigger a sufficient order to cover Period 22's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we observe that the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout all 22 periods of history. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate volatility without a clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift, ranging between 52 and 150 units per period. The recent 10-period average demand is approximately 107.4, which is slightly higher than the overall average but consistent with the historical range. Since profit ($4.0) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 0.8, justifying a service level that captures a substantial portion of the demand distribution to avoid stockouts (as seen in Periods 3, 12, 14, 18, 20). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean while smoothing out single-period spikes. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 0-period lead time is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $494.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 18-23) has shown higher volatility and slightly higher peaks (ranging from 65 to 133, with several periods exceeding 120), compared to the earlier history. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every single transaction in history. Since current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) and there is no in-transit inventory, I need to ensure the order covers the expected high-end demand for Period 24. A profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 implies a target service level of 80%, but given the frequent stockouts in history (Periods 3, 12, 14, 18, 20), I will use a larger sample size (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher variance while smoothing out the noise from fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $195.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variability but remains within a relatively consistent mean range. Analyzing the last 24 periods, the average demand is approximately 101 units per period, while the most recent 10 periods show a slightly higher average of 101.5 units and a standard deviation reflecting significant swings (ranging from 65 to 133). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01 'conclude' message in history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 65 units. Given the high criticality of stockouts (evident in Period 3, 12, 14, 18, 20 where demand met or exceeded on-hand inventory), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand volatility while acknowledging the stable 0-period lead time. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the high-demand spikes seen recently (e.g., 124, 121 units) while maintaining the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 25 periods. The historical demand data (including the provided seed samples and game history) shows a consistent mean around 98-100 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. Since the profit is $4.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level is q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. The current on-hand inventory is 32. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the lead time plus current period demand (L+1 = 1 period) at the 80% service level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods: 121, 82, 124, 65, 93, 59; mean = 90.6). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as demand fluctuates between 60 and 150 units without a clear trend. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility and mean while smoothing out outliers. This helps balance the service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) by ensuring we have enough stock for a 1-period lookahead (L=0 means review + lead = 1 period).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown consistent behavior throughout the first 27 periods without a distinct regime shift. From the historical data (Periods 1-27), the average demand is approximately 100 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26 units. The product description and period dates don't suggest any immediate holiday-related spikes. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the starting inventory for Period 28 is extremely low (1 unit), the OR backend needs to place an order that covers the current period's demand. I've chosen to use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the more recent variability while remaining stable, as there were several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (e.g., P3, P12, P14, P18, P20, P23, P27). This setting helps maintain a safety stock that buffers against peaks in the 120-135 range seen recently.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility with a slight upward trend in recent periods (mean of last 5 periods is approximately 90, compared to the overall mean). However, the demand in individual periods remains highly variable (ranging from 59 to 123 in the last 5 periods). Since the promised lead time holds (L=0), I will set L to 'default'. To capture the recent variability and ensure a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to balance historical data with recent demand behavior.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 29 periods, with no strong evidence of a seasonal shift or regime change. The average demand across all historical data (Periods 1-29) is approximately 98.7 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 25-29) show an average of 94 units, suggesting a slight cooling but consistent with overall volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to maintain the observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture a stable, medium-term average that smooths out short-term fluctuations while remaining more responsive than the full history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears to be in a stable regime without strong seasonal trends evident in the first 30 periods. The average demand across all periods is approximately 100.8 units with a standard deviation of 25.4. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a similar mean of 106.9. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), the service level (q) should be 0.80. Setting parameters to 'default' for L and sigma_hat will use all historical data, while specifying recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 will capture the slightly higher demand trend observed in the latter half of the history (P11-P30 mean \u2248 104) compared to the start.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1, suggesting a high service level is optimal. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Demand over the last 31 periods has been relatively stable but volatile, with a mean around 99 units. Recent demand (Periods 30 and 31) has been higher than average (126 and 127 units). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility while remaining responsive to the recent slight upswing in demand. Since lead time is consistently 0, L is set to 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend over the last few periods (Periods 30-32: 126, 127, 121), which is notably higher than the historical average from the first 29 periods. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 1 to 29 was approximately 97 units, whereas the mean for the last 3 periods is 124.7. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 32 conclude' message (ordered P32, arrived P32). With on-hand inventory sitting at only 1 unit and 0 units in transit, I must aggressively replenish to meet this higher demand regime and prevent stockouts. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent spike while maintaining some stability against individual period noise. This will increase the base stock level to reflect the current 120+ unit demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 30: Average demand increased from ~97 to ~125 (+29%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 30. The average demand for Periods 1-29 was approximately 97 units, whereas the average demand for the most recent four periods (30-33) has surged to approximately 131.5 units (126, 127, 121, 152). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. At the start of Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. To avoid stockouts and capture the increased demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize data from the current high-demand regime. This provides a service level targeted at approximately 80% (profit $4 / (profit $4 + holding $1)), which the OR backend will adjust to cover the next period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed and sustained: Average demand increased from ~97 to ~132 (+36%) over 4 periods. Maximum demand in this regime reached 152 in Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime change starting around Period 30. While the previous five periods (P30-P34) averaged approximately 118 units, a massive spike occurred in Period 33 (152 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 34 (63 units). This volatility suggests that while the mean has increased compared to the pre-P30 era (~97 units), the variance is also significantly higher. I am maintaining the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this higher-demand regime (mean ~117.8), and using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~33.8 in the last 5 periods). Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use the default lead time setting. This approach ensures the base stock level remains high enough to cover potential spikes like P33 without over-penalizing for the outlier low in P34.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 30 alongside the mean shift; standard deviation in P30-P34 is approximately 33.8 compared to earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 30, with a significant increase in both mean and volatility compared to Periods 1-29. In the most recent 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has averaged 124.3 with a standard deviation of 33.2. Period 35 demand was exceptionally high (157), leading to a stockout. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all orders have arrived within the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent +36% mean shift and the increased variance, maintaining service levels in this more volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the new regime; Period 35 demand of 157 is the highest observed to date.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting at Period 30. Recent demands are: 126, 127, 121, 152, 63, 157, 57. The mean demand in this 7-period regime (P30-P36) is approximately 114.7, while the standard deviation is significantly higher (~41) than the historical average. The promised lead time remains 0, and history confirms orders arrive consistently within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since Period 30, we have seen two instances of stockouts (P33 and P35) followed by low demand periods (P34 and P36), suggesting high variance. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime while adjusting for the 0-period lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher volatility (sigma) observed since Period 30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $501.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, characterized by a higher mean (avg ~114 vs previous ~97) and significantly higher volatility. Periods 33-37 show demand fluctuating wildly (152, 63, 157, 57, 130). In the last 8 periods (since P30), the average is 116.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 38.3. This high volatility is the primary challenge for the OR backend. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this new regime's mean and variance specifically. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, matching the promised lead time, so I will use the default setting for L. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased uncertainty in demand since Period 30, helping to maintain service levels despite the frequent stockouts observed in this latter half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with both the mean and volatility increasing significantly. Since Period 30, demand observations are: 126, 127, 121, 152, 63, 157, 57, 130, 133. The average for this 9-period regime is approximately 118.4, and the standard deviation has risen to roughly 36.5. Despite the high variance (e.g., drops to 63 and 57 interspersed with peaks of 150+), the current on-hand inventory is low (15 units). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Using 'recent_N' with N=9 captures this new high-mean, high-volatility regime effectively for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we stock enough to meet the increased demand peaks while the OR backend's service level logic (based on profit/holding cost) prevents excessive overstocking during the periodic dips.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 30 confirmed: mean ~118, with significantly increased volatility (sigma ~36.5) and high peak demand (157).

Daily Reward (R_t): $571.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, moving from a mean of ~97 to a higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 121.0 with a standard deviation of 33.7. The most recent demand (P39) was 144, following 133 and 130, confirming the sustained high-demand period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent regime shift and high volatility while ensuring high service levels (profit=4, holding=1, so critical ratio is 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to react to the new mean and the significant uptick in variance seen since Period 30.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, characterized by a higher mean (~120) and significantly higher volatility compared to the initial 29 periods. In the last 11 periods (P30-P40), demand has ranged from 57 to 157, with an average of 119.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. Transitioning from the previous 'recent_N' or 'calculated' methods to 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher-variability regime. Specifically, choosing mu_hat = 120 (mean of the new regime) and sigma_hat = 38 (slightly above the observed standard deviation to account for frequent stockouts/peaks). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Setting L method to 'default' as no delays have been observed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, characterized by a higher mean (~120) and significantly higher volatility compared to the initial 30 periods. In the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand is 115.8 with a standard deviation of 35.8. Recent periods (P40-P41) show high variability (115 followed by 64). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage this increased volatility and the resulting stockout risk observed in the new regime (e.g., P30, P31, P33, P35), I am using N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the full extent of the new regime's behavior while providing enough samples to stabilize the sigma estimate. The OR backend's service level (calculated as 4/(4+1) = 80%) combined with these parameters will help maintain a buffer against the frequent demand spikes seen in this segment.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with both mean and volatility increasing significantly. Since Period 30, the demand has averaged approximately 118 units per period, but recent spikes (e.g., Period 35 demand of 157) and drops (Period 41 demand of 64) demonstrate high variance. For Period 43, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 (covering Periods 30-42) to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, so L is set to 'default'. By using recent data for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the base-stock policy will better account for the current demand environment, aiming to maintain enough inventory to prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs during quieter periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, characterized by a higher mean (~118) and significantly increased volatility (sigma ~36.5). Recent demand samples (P30-P43) show a range of 57 to 157. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. To account for the sustained higher mean and capture the volatility observed in the current regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the entire new regime since P30). Lead time is set to default (0). Current on-hand inventory is 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, moving from a mean of ~97 to a higher and more volatile state. Since Period 30 (N=15), the average demand is approximately 114.7. While recent demand in Periods 41-44 (64, 103, 101, 88) has been slightly lower than the peak of 157 seen in Period 35, the overall volatility remains elevated. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, with every order arriving in the period it was placed. To capture the current regime's characteristics while acknowledging the recent stabilization, I am using recent_N with N=15 (covering Period 30 to present) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the higher mean and the significant volatility (sigma ~33.5 in this regime) to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, characterized by a higher mean (approx. 115) and increased volatility. Recent demand (P41-P45: 64, 103, 101, 88, 125) shows the mean is around 96.2, which is slightly lower than the early part of this regime but still higher than the pre-P30 average of ~97 (note: P30-P40 mean was ~118). Given the high volatility (sigma ~36.5 noted in Carry-over insights), I will use the last 16 periods (P30 to P45) to capture this entire high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Inventory analysis: On-hand is 53, with 0 in-transit. The demand history since Period 30 has shown a significant regime shift. In the last 17 periods (P30-P46), the mean demand is approximately 110 with a standard deviation of roughly 31. This is much higher than the pre-P30 average of ~97. Although demand in the last two periods (P45=125, P46=87) has fluctuated, the long-term trend of this regime is stable. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Following the 'recent_N' strategy for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the entire current regime since P30) provides the most robust estimate for the backend to calculate the base-stock level while capturing the increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 30, moving from a mean of ~97 to a higher mean of ~115-120 with increased volatility. However, more recent demand (Periods 44-47: 88, 125, 87, 69) suggests the mean may be stabilizing or slightly softening compared to the peak volatility observed between P30-P40. The current on-hand inventory is 67 units. Promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=$4 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target the 80th percentile of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the regime from P30 to P47) to capture the current state accurately while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen in this regime. This ensures we maintain a sufficient service level for the remaining 3 periods of the game without excessive overstocking.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=69, arrived=69 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=136, demand=82, sold=82, ending on-hand inventory=54
Daily Profit: $328.00, Daily Holding Cost: $54.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $274.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has shown a higher average (~112) and significantly higher volatility compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 108.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 25. Period 48 ending on-hand inventory is 54. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). Given we are at Period 49 out of 50, I will use a recent_N approach (N=19, covering the regime start at P30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and heightened variance of this late-game regime, ensuring the inventory is sufficient to meet the final periods' demand without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $261.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, moving from a mean of ~97 to a higher, more volatile level. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P30-P49), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 with a significant standard deviation of roughly 31.7. Although recent demand (P47-P49) has been lower (69, 82, 79), the overall regime since P30 remains more volatile than the initial period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N=20 to capture this entire second regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances the higher early peaks of this regime with the more recent moderate demand, while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the observed high volatility (profit/holding ratio of 4:1 implies a target service level of 80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: mean established at ~108 with significantly higher volatility (sigma ~32) compared to P1-P29.
