{
  "rationale": "1. Lead Time Analysis: Consistent history from P1-P48 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I can expect orders placed in P49 to arrive and be available for P49 demand. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 44 units. In the recent regime (P34-P48), demand has averaged approximately 104 units per period, with significant volatility (highs of 157, lows of 57). 3. OR Baseline Evaluation: The OR recommendation is 82 units. Since L=0, the formula effectively targets a safe stock level to cover P49 demand. However, the OR's recommendation is currently influenced by the lower demand period (P1-P30). Recent demand is higher. 4. Strategic Adjustment: To mitigate the risk of stockout in this higher-demand regime, I need to ensure total available inventory (44 + order) is around 135-150 units. Ordering 100 units brings total availability to 144, which is a safer buffer than the OR's 126 (44+82). 5. Game End Constraint: As this is P49 of 50, I should avoid over-ordering to prevent holding costs or leftover stock in P50, but a stockout represents a larger loss ($4 profit vs $1 holding).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. Since the simulation ends after this period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory and avoiding stockouts. The OR recommendation is 60 units. Current on-hand inventory is 65 units. Historically, since Period 30, the average demand has been approximately 130 units (ranging from 57 to 157). To minimize the risk of a stockout in this final period, the total available inventory (On-hand + New Order) should be roughly equal to the upper end of the expected demand range. Following the OR recommendation of 60 would bring total inventory to 125 (65 + 60), which is slightly below the recent average of 130 and well below the peaks. I will increase the order slightly to 75 to ensure a total availability of 140 units, which covers the average demand and provides a buffer for higher-than-average demand without excessive holding costs for the final conclusion.",
