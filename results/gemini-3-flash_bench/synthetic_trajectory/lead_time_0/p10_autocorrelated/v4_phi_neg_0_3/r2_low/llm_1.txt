Looking at the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to satisfy this period's demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately while being mindful of holding costs.

Demand over the last 16 periods has averaged ~100 units (mean: 100.375), with a recent range typically between 80 and 138. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Since the actual lead time is 0, the total available inventory for Period 17 will be (On-hand + Order).

To reach a target stock level of 140 (which has safely covered almost all historical peaks, including the 138 in Period 11) for Period 35, and accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 40, I will order 100 units.
