The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the same period to meet Period 1 demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 and ensure a buffer for Period 2. The demand has an upward trend in the final sample (134), so I will target a stock level that covers a slightly higher-than-average demand of ~120 units for Period 1, plus a safety stock for Period 2. Given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, I need to be careful not to overstock significantly, but the high risk of a stockout in Period 1 (with 0 starting inventory) necessitates an immediate order. I will order 125 units to cover Period 1 demand and provide a small carryover for Period 2.",
