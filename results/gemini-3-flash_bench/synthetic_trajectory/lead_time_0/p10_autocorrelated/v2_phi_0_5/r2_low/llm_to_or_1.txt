Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 0. On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111), averaging 116 units. However, since the current observation is for Period 1 decision and we only see the demand data provided in the prompt as 'historical', I will use the mean of those 5 samples to set the initial base stock. Given that L=0, the system will order to meet the immediate period's demand. I will use the recent_N method based on the 5 available samples to capture the provided demand pattern while acknowledging the volatility (range 75-138).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 90, which is higher than the Period 1 sample provided in the history (75). The arrival was immediate (lead_time=0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Given the demand variability (75, 138, 134, 122, 111 in historical samples and now 90 in Period 1), the mean is roughly 112. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim to stock the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent historical distribution, and 'default' for L since the lead time of 0 is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 40 units. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has been consistently 0 periods (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in P1 and P2 respectively), matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows P1 (90) and P2 (79), while the provided historical demand data (P1-P5) suggests an average demand of approximately 116 units. Specifically, P3-P5 show a significant upward shift (134, 122, 111) compared to the 'concluded' history. To prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples from the historical demand data to capture this higher mean (~116) and volatility. This ensures the base stock (mu + z*sigma) covers the current period's demand which occurs immediately after the decision, given L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across P1-P5 is [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], with a mean of 116. Demand in the most recent three periods (P3-P5) has stabilized at a slightly higher level than Period 1, averaging 122.3. Given the Lead Time (L) of 0, the review period is 1+L=1. To prevent stockouts seen in the history where ending inventory was low (e.g., 24 units), I will use the recent 3 samples (P3-P5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they better reflect the current demand regime compared to the early samples. This approach sets the base stock level to cover the immediate period's demand plus a safety margin based on recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: demand in the first three periods was relatively stable (avg \u2248 84), but Period 4 saw a significant spike to 141, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P4) confirm that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual L=0). Given the stockout and the recent demand jump, I need to adjust the OR parameters to prevent further lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump while providing enough buffer for the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). Selecting N=4 allows the model to sensitive to the spike in Period 4 while still considering the earlier baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observed that demand (107) was again higher than our starting on-hand (99), leading to lost sales for the second consecutive period. The historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show a significantly higher mean (approx 116) compared to the 'sold' units reported in the conclude messages, which were constrained by inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. To prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full range of recent demand variations (averaging ~116 per period). Since lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the volatility seen in the samples (std dev ~25), providing a sufficient safety stock buffer given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.5, but stockouts are costly in terms of total reward).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high critical fractile (0.50, given profit=$1 and holding cost=$1) which indicates we should stock for the median demand. However, we have experienced stockouts in the last three periods (P4, P5, P6), losing sales because our inventory didn't cover the demand spike. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 is reliable. Recent demand (P4-P6) has shifted higher compared to P1-P3. I will use N=6 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility and increase sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the higher variance observed during the stockout periods, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period_4: Average demand increased from ~84 (P1-P3) to ~118 (P4-P6 based on demand vs sales), leading to consistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows two distinct phases. Phase 1 (Periods 1-3) had an average demand of 84.3. Phase 2 (Periods 4-6) experienced a significant spike, averaging 117.7 units, leading to consecutive stockouts. However, Period 7 saw a drop back to 75 units. Despite this recent drop, the historical data (P4-P7) suggests a higher mean than the initial phase. Given that the promised lead time of 0 is being honored (all orders arrived in the same period), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (Periods 4-7) to capture the higher volatility and elevated mean seen in the second regime, while accounting for the recent low demand in Period 7 to avoid over-ordering during a potential cooling-off period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows two distinct regimes. Periods 1-3 averaged ~84, while Periods 4-6 showed a spike (avg ~118) causing stockouts. However, Periods 7-8 have seen a return to lower levels (avg 77). The 'carry-over insight' from Period 7 flagged a regime shift, but the two most recent periods suggest that spike might have been temporary or highly volatile. Current on-hand is 28. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level (z=0). To prevent further stockouts if demand remains elevated but avoid excess holding cost if it stays low, I will use a recent N window that captures both the spike and the recent cool-down. I'll set N=5 for demand (covering P4-P8) to reconcile the high-demand volatility (avg of P4-P8 is approx 101.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows two distinct regimes. Periods 1-3 averaged ~84, followed by a surge in Periods 4-6 averaging ~118 (causing significant stockouts), and a recent stabilization in Periods 7-9 averaging ~81. The current on-hand inventory is 14. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high parity between profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P7-P9) which averages 80.6 units. This approach avoids overreacting to the mid-game spike while ensuring we don't carry excess inventory for this low-margin/high-holding-cost item.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in Period 7: Average demand returned to ~81 (P7-P9) after the Period 4-6 spike (~118). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary spike from Periods 4-6. Over the last four periods (P7-P10), demand has averaged 75.75 (75, 79, 88, 61), which is consistent with the early period regime (~84). The stockouts observed in the middle of the game are no longer a concern. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid both excessive holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0/unit) and missing potential shifts, I will use a shorter window of 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current stable regime rather than the historical spike or the very early data, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~75-80 unit demand range.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization following the spike in Periods 4-6. From Period 7 to Period 11, observed demand has been 75, 79, 88, 61, and 69, resulting in a mean of 74.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 10.4. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is low (7 units) and there are no units in transit, I am setting the parameters using a recent_N window (N=5) to reflect this stable 'normal' regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers current demand levels while considering the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a significant demand spike (133 units), which exceeded the available inventory (75 units), leading to a stockout. This spike is similar to the demand regime observed between Periods 4-6 (avg ~118), suggesting a possible return to high volatility or a new high-demand phase. The carry-over insights previously identified a regime change back to ~81 units (Periods 7-11 mean: 74.4). However, the Period 12 jump is much higher than that average. Given the product (chips) often has volatile demand, I must adjust the parameters to account for this recent outlier. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the stable period plus this new spike (avg for P7-P12 is 84.1). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher variance observed across both the recent stable period and the spike. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 based on consistent immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike observed Period 12 (133 units), potentially signaling a return to the high-volatility regime seen in Periods 4-6.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14. Analysis of recent demand shows a definitive upward regime shift starting at Period 12. Demand in P12 (133) and P13 (138) significantly exceeds the previous stabilization period (P7-P11 average of ~72). Historical data also shows a previous high-demand regime in P4-P6 (average ~118), suggesting this product exhibits bursty or seasonal demand patterns. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after consecutive stockouts. Because lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the OR backend requires parameters that cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the recent spike (P11-P13) while moving away from the lower demand of the P7-P11 period. This will set mu_hat closer to 113 (average of 69, 133, 138), ensuring the base stock level is high enough to satisfy the current high-demand wave and recover from the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12: Average demand increased from ~72 (P7-P11) to ~135 (P12-P13), currently causing stockouts.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a confirmed high-demand regime that started in Period 12. In the last three periods (P12-P14), observed demand was 133, 138, and 117 (average ~129.3), significantly higher than the previous baseline. For three consecutive periods, demand has exceeded supply (ending on-hand inventory is 0), indicating the OR backend is under-ordering because it's using long-term historical averages which include the lower-demand periods (P7-P11). To address this and prevent further stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand window. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so L is set to 'default'. The objective is to raise the base stock level immediately to match the current demand run-rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting at Period 12. Prior to this, demand averaged ~72 units (P7-P11), but recent demand has surged to an average of ~126.5 units (P12: 133, P13: 138, P14: 117, P15: 118). Period 14 and 15 conclude messages confirm these high demand levels, resulting in stockouts or very low ending inventory. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P15 order arrived in P15). Given the critical need to avoid lost sales when profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), and the observation that demand has stabilized at this new higher level, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new regime (P12-P15). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent average of ~127 and its associated volatility, helping the OR backend set a base stock that covers the current demand spike while accounting for the same-day delivery (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12: Average demand increased from ~72 (P7-P11) to ~127 (P12-P15), now stabilized at the higher level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 12. Prior to Period 12 (specifically P7-P11), the mean demand was approximately 72 units. Since Period 12, the demand observed/censored has been: 133, 138, 117, 118, and 161. In Period 16, even with 127 units of starting inventory, we stocked out with a demand of 161, confirming the sustained high-demand regime. The mean of the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is approximately 133.4. Given the high volatility (standard deviation of the last 5 periods is approx 18.5) and the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the OR backend's service level target is naturally conservative. However, because we are frequently stocking out, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to correctly account represent the recent variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The most recent shift started at Period 12, with demand significantly increasing and remains sustained. Over Periods 12-17, demand values were 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, and 124, averaging approximately 132 units per period. The system experienced stockouts in Periods 12, 13, 14, and 16 because the order quantities (based on previous lower demand regimes) were insufficient. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods based on the 'conclude' history (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). To capture this high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts while managing the trade-off with holding cost (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 implies a 50% target service level, but the OR backend uses the critical ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (Period 12-17) to match the current regime. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting at Period 12. Since then, demand has averaged approximately 138.5 units per period (P12-P18: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138), significantly higher than the previous baseline. The system is still struggling with stockouts, having ended Period 18 with 0 inventory despite orders arriving. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue to use a recent_N strategy with N=7 (covering the current high-demand regime from P12-P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this elevated volatility and mean. This will help the backend order sufficient quantities to meet demand and reach the target service level (q=0.5 given Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P12 confirmed and sustained: Avg demand increased from ~72 to ~138 (+92%). Recent periods (P16-P18) show continued high volatility (peak 161).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 begins with a confirmed high-demand regime that started in Period 12. Analyzing demand from Period 12 to Period 19: samples are [133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, 102]. The mean of this regime is approximately 128.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 18.2. Although the last period (P19) saw a dip to 102, the overall trend since P12 remains significantly higher than the P7-P11 baseline (~72). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock (approx. mean + z*sigma) adequately covers the current 120-140 unit demand range while accounting for the recent P16 spike (161). The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 0.50, but since the OR backend uses a capped policy and safety stock, focusing on the correct regime mean is critical to avoid the stockouts seen in P12-P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 12, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand has been quite volatile but has averaged approximately 125 units over the last 9 periods (P12-P20). However, the most recent two periods (P19 and P20) showed a slight dip to 102 and 95 respectively. This could indicate a subtle shift or simply variance within the high-demand regime. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, which targets the median demand. To prevent stockouts seen frequently in this regime while not over-ordering during this potential dip, I will use a recent N of 9 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand period from P12 onwards) and recent N of 9 for sigma_hat to capture the regime's heightened volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean following the high-volatility regime that persisted from Period 12 to Period 18 (average demand ~133). Since Period 19, the observed demand has been 102, 95, and 90, suggesting a significant drop and a return to a more moderate regime (average ~96). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as evidenced by 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrivals. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am transitioning to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent deceleration while still providing coverage for the detected shift. This balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~133 (P12-P18) to ~96 (P19-P21), indicating a cooling off from previous peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new stable regime since Period 19. After a high-volatility peak (Periods 12-18, avg ~133), demand has cooled significantly. For the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has been 102, 95, 90, and 89, respectively, resulting in a mean of 94. This represents a distinct downward shift from the previous average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this cooling trend. This will set a lower base stock level that aligns with the current consumption rate of ~90-95 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 19 confirmed: demand dropped from an average of ~133 (P12-P18) to ~94 (P19-P22), a decrease of ~29%.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, demand spiked back up to 113, which is 20% higher than the average of 94 observed during the Period 19-22 'cooling off' phase. The stockout in Period 23 (starting on-hand 94, demand 113) indicates that the previous reduction in base stock was too aggressive. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable (confirmed through Period 23), I'm shifting to a more responsive forecasting method to capture these sudden fluctuations within the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering P19-P23) for mu_hat to account for the most recent trend while acknowledging the latest volatility. For sigma_hat, N=5 is chosen to ensure the safety stock is sufficient to handle the observed variance between 89 and 113 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. While Periods 19-22 showed a cooling trend (avg ~94), Periods 23 and 24 saw a sharp resurgence in demand (113 and 155 respectively), leading to stockouts. This indicates the 'cooling off' identified in the carry-over insights was temporary or that the product is entering another high-demand regime similar to the Period 12-18 peak. Period 24 demand (155) is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average. Since lead time is consistently 0, I must ensure the base stock is high enough to meet these sudden spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current volatile regime (Periods 19-24), which yields an average demand of approximately 107. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has returned starting Period 23: after a brief cooling period (P19-P22 avg ~94), demand spiked again to 113 and 155 (2-period avg ~134), resulting in immediate stockouts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that restarted around Period 23. In the last three periods (P23-P25), demand was 113, 155, and 139, resulting in three consecutive periods of stockouts (ending inventory 0). The observed lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To address the current stockouts and capture the volatile peaks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average demand ~135) to align with this latest surge. Since lead time L=0, the backend will target a base stock level of (1+0)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Using a short N for sigma_hat (N=5) will allow the model to adjust to the increased standard deviation observed in the current spike, helping to restore the service level and prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified again at Period 23: P23-P25 demand (113, 155, 139) averaged 135.6, causing 3 consecutive stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit regime-shifting behavior. After a cooling period (P19-P22, avg ~94), demand spiked significantly between P23 and P25 (113, 155, 139), leading to stockouts. Period 26 saw a slight cooling to 101 units. Given the high volatility and the fact that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent variability, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to include the P23-P26 data (avg ~127). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect this volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a significant peak between Periods 23-25 (average demand ~135.6) followed by a sharp drop in Period 27 (demand = 43). This drop may be an outlier or the start of a cooling-off period similar to Periods 19-21. To account for this recent shift while maintaining protection against the high volatility observed frequently throughout the game history, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. This window captures the high demand spike (155, 139) and the recent low (43), providing a balanced mean estimate for mu_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture this heightened local volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock (z* calculation) despite the low demand in Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility shift: Period 27 demand dropped to 43 after a high-demand phase (P23-P25 avg 136). Monitoring to see if this represents a new low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-91.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current sentiment: Demand has plummeted sharply in the last two periods (Period 27: 43, Period 28: 10), following a high-volatility phase (P23-P26 avg: 127). The inventory on-hand of 101 units is now significant given this drop. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift while still acknowledging the high volatility of the preceding few periods. My base stock calculation will likely result in an order of zero this period to allow existing inventory to bleed off, which is the correct response to a 90% demand reduction (from P26 to P28). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 27: Demand dropped from a high-volatility average of ~127 (P23-P26) to 43 and 10 in the last two periods, signaling a potential seasonal cliff or post-event drop.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 27. After a volatile high-demand period (P23-P26 avg ~127), demand dropped sharply to 43 (P27) and then 10 (P28). Period 29 showed a partial recovery to 89, but the 3-period average (P27-P29) is only 47.3 units. Given this structural drop, using a standard long-term average would result in excessive overstocking, especially since the holding cost ($1) equals the profit per unit ($1), meaning we must be extremely cautious about ending inventory. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new lower-demand level (P27-P29), as the previous high-demand regime is no longer relevant. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current high uncertainty/variance in this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 27 confirmed: demand dropped from the P23-P26 average of 127 to a lower, highly volatile level (P27-P29 avg ~47). Monitoring for signs of stabilization or further decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is in a state of high volatility following a sharp demand drop in Periods 27-28. Demand in Period 29 (89) and Period 30 (71) suggests the 'seasonal cliff' was less of a permanent drop and more of a temporary fluctuation or a shift to a mid-range regime. Current demand is averaging approx 53 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30), but P29-P30 specifically average 80. Given the inventory is at 0 and the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent low (10, 43) and the partial recovery (89, 71), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the high current uncertainty without overreacting to the extreme low of P28. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that covers the immediate demand for Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new lower-mid level after Period 27: P27-P30 avg demand is 53.25 units, significantly lower than the P23-P26 avg of 127 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 27) shows a significant decrease in average demand compared to previous peaks. After the sharp drop in P28-P29 (10 and 89 respectively), the last two periods (P30-P31) recorded demands of 71 and 57. The average for this new regime (P27-P31) is approximately 54 units per period. The inventory is currently at zero, and lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering following the volatile highs of earlier phases while ensuring stock for the current lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5 from P27-P31). This period's demand (P32) is part of the 'review+lead' window (L=0 means we need to cover 1 period of demand). Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, aiming for the median demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 27. The average demand from Period_27 to Period_32 is approximately 48.7 units (43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22), compared to the previous high-volatility regime (P23-P26) which averaged 127 units. Although the demand is volatile (varying from 10 to 89), it is consistently lower than the historical peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units. The lead time is confirmed to be stable at 0 periods. To avoid both excessive holding costs and stockouts in this lower-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this most recent regime starting at Period 27. This N is chosen to capture the full scope of the recent drop while providing enough samples to account for the current variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the peaks seen in Periods 23-26. Starting from Period 27, the demand has been highly variable but centered around a lower mean. Over the last 7 periods (P27-P33), the demand values were 43, 10, 89, 71, 57, 22, and 67, yielding an average of roughly 51.2 units per period. The current 'On-hand' inventory is 0. Given the consistent 0-period lead time observed throughout the history, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this current regime's mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the recent average demand and its standard deviation, aiming to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 30, 31, and 33 while minimizing holding costs in periods with lower realizations like P32.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly starting around Period 27. While previous insights noted a drop to ~47-53 units, recent demand in Periods 30-34 shows slightly higher activity and volatility: 71 (P30), 57 (P31), 22 (P32), 67 (P33), and 62 (P34). The current 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 55.8 units, which is consistent with the lower-mid regime noted in Period 31 but shows a slight upward creep compared to the immediate post-cliff drop. There is still a risk of stockouts (seen in P30, P31, P33, P34) because the inventory levels are tight. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR engine will target. To capture this stabilized but slightly increased demand level while allowing for the observed volatility, I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (covering P27-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides enough data to stabilize the mean after the sharp drop while acknowledging the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mid regime starting around Period 27. Over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), the average demand is approximately 47 units, though it remains volatile (ranging from 10 to 89). The most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) show a slightly higher average of 53.2 units compared to the immediate post-drop phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this current regime's mean while allowing for the observed volatility. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with no missing shipments. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to account for the significant variance observed even within this lower demand level (e.g., the jump from 22 to 67 units in consecutive periods). This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-profit items while avoiding excessive holding costs in a lower-volume environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new regime since Period 27/28. Following a spike in volatility (P23-P26), demand dropped significantly and has settled into a lower-mid level. For the most recent 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is approximately 56.2 units. Recent demand in Period 36 was 90, which caused a stockout (ending on-hand 0). Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture the recent stabilized lower-demand level while acknowledging the recent uptick, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the model to adjust to the post-Period 27 environment (avg ~56) without being overly influenced by the historical highs of P12-P26 (avg ~130).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P27-P36 average demand is approximately 56 units, compared to the previous high-volatility regime (P23-P26) of 127 units. Volatility remains present (range: 10 to 90), but the mean has fundamentally shifted lower.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 37, with demand reaching 120 units, far exceeding the stable average of ~56 units observed from P27-P36. This follows a high of 90 units in P36, suggesting the start of a new high-demand phase similar to the volatility seen in P23-P26 (avg 127) or P12-P18 (avg 138). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts (which have occurred for the last two periods), I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this upward movement (P35-P37 demand: 58, 90, 120; avg ~89). Given the return of high volatility and the equal cost of holding vs. stockout ($1.0), I will use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a larger buffer, reflecting the standard deviation of these recent spikes (~31).

Carry-over insight: New demand spike observed starting Period 36: demand rose from a stable ~56 (P27-P35) to 90 (P36) and 120 (P37), signaling a return to a high-volatility/high-demand regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again starting at Period 36. After a period of relative stability (P27-P35 avg ~56), the last three periods (P36-P38) recorded demands of 90, 120, and 95, averaging approximately 101.7. This shift has led to three consecutive stockouts, as the 'on-hand' inventory was insufficient to meet demand. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, but due to the high penalty of stockouts (lost profit), it's crucial to adjust \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this recent high-volatility regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate surge while lead time (L) remains stable at 0. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock level that covers the current higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 36: average demand increased from ~56 (P27-P35) to ~102 (P36-P38), a ~82% increase, causing consecutive stockouts.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-volatility regime starting at Period 36. Demand values for the last four periods were 90, 120, 95, and 117, averaging 105.5 units. This is a significant increase from the previous stable period (P27-P35 avg ~56). The system has experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P36-P39) because the OR parameters were still reflecting the lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. To address this shift and stop the stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime, while keeping L at the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: average demand increased from ~56 (P27-P35) to ~106 (P36-P39), an 89% increase, resulting in 4 consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to 40 is approximately 104 units (90, 120, 95, 117, 99). This represents a significant shift from the previous regime (P27-P35) which averaged around 56 units. We have experienced multiple stockouts during this transition (P36-P39). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. To accurately capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent volatility, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (P36-P40) and doing the same for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's variance. This will set a base stock level that aims to cover the expected demand of ~104 units plus a safety buffer, adjusted by the 0-period lead time logic of the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown consistent regime shifts throughout the history. The most recent shift occurred at Period 36, moving from a low-demand phase (~56 units) to a high-demand phase. While Periods 36-39 saw an average demand of ~106 units leading to stockouts, the last two periods (P40-P41) have shown a slight cooling with demand at 99 and 69 units respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. To respond to the high volatility while acknowledging the recent slight drop, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime from P36-P41) to capture the current mean of ~98.3, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 remains active but showing high volatility (range 69-120). Average demand for this regime (P36-P41) is 98.3 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 36, characterized by higher mean and volatility. In the recent segment (P36-P42), demand values were 90, 120, 95, 117, 99, 69, and 0 (note: Period 42 demand of 0 is likely an outlier or an early reporting data point, but following the established high-demand phase P36-P41, the mean is approx 98). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 99 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the service level requirement is high (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 implies a 50% critical fractile, but historical stockouts suggest the OR engine's default capping logic requires robust mu_hat and sigma_hat settings to prevent lost sales), I will use the recent_N method (N=7) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while accounting for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 remains active: P36-P42 average demand is approx 84 units (including P42's 0 demand), with a core average of ~98 units prior to P42. Standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the P27-P35 period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting around Period 36. Following a high-demand phase (averaging ~106 units P36-P40), Period 42 and 43 recorded 0 demand. This suggests a potential localized 'cliff' or a temporary cessation of demand, similar to the drop seen in Period 28. Because the product is a standard SKU (chips) and historical patterns show demand typically resumes after such drops, I will transition the forecast to a 'recent_N' approach (N=8) to capture the mix of the recent zero-demand periods (P42-P43) and the preceding high-demand regime (P36-P41). Lead time remains reliably 0. On-hand inventory is currently high (99 units) due to the zero demand in P42-43; using a 8-period window for mu_hat will moderate the order to avoid excessive overstocking while maintaining enough buffer for a potential rebound.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand cliff observed in P42-P43 (0 demand units), following a high-demand regime P36-P41 (avg ~98).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly uncertain phase following a significant regime shift. After a period of high demand (P36-P41, avg ~98), demand crashed to 0 for two periods (P42-P43) and then partially recovered to 41 in P44. The inventory on-hand (58) currently exceeds the most recent demand (41). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which typically translates to a base stock near the mean. However, the recent volatility (98 to 0 to 41) makes the 'default' and long-term 'recent_N' methods less reliable. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly toward the new lower activity level (averaging ~13.67 units over P42-P44) while acknowledging high volatility. Since on-hand (58) + pipeline (0) already covers the likely demand for the next period, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order, which is appropriate for managing holding costs against this demand 'cliff'. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 42 confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~98 (P36-P41) to ~13.7 (P42-P44), representing a significant slowdown or seasonal drop.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is experiencing another regime shift. After a 'demand cliff' in Periods 42-44 (averaging ~13.7 units), Period 45 saw a sudden spike to 127 units, which resulted in a total stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests the low-demand phase was transitory and the high-volatility regime (averaging ~98 units in P36-P41) or a new spike is active. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, I need to restock immediately to capture remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the game's end. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the mix of the recent drop and the new spike (P42-P45), which provides a balanced but responsive mu_hat. Lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after a 3-period low (P42-P44 avg ~13.7), demand spiked to 127 in P45, confirming that the low-demand regime was not permanent.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility following a 'cliff' in Periods 42-43. After three periods of low demand (P42=0, P43=0, P44=41), demand spiked to 127 in P45 and remained high at 80 in P46. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 45 suggests a shift to a lower regime (~13.7), but the P45-P46 data (avg 103.5) contradicts this, signaling a return to the high-volatility regime seen in P36-P41 (avg ~98). Because of these rapid swings and the immediate stockout in P46, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 periods (P36-P46) to capture both the high-demand peaks and the recent zeros, providing a balanced but responsive forecast. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: the 'cliff' observed in P42-P44 was transitory, with demand returning to high levels (P45=127, P46=80). The market is oscillating between 0 and ~130 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility after the period 42-44 'cliff'. In the last three periods (P45-P47), demand was 127, 80, and 78, demonstrating that the market has returned to a high-demand regime, though slightly below the previous peak (avg ~95). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units. Given the profit ($1) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 50%, but the backend formula includes a safety stock cap at 95%. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed in P45-P47, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P45-P47) while accounting for the recent zero-demand periods to avoid over-ordering given the 1:1 cost ratio. I've set N=6 to include the low periods (P42-P44) and the recovery periods (P45-P47), providing a balanced but responsive mu_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is exhibiting extreme demand volatility. After a significant 'cliff' in Periods 42-44, demand has rebounded sharply, with the latest observation (P48) at 118 units, leading to a stockout. The average demand since the return to high-volatility levels (P45-P48) is approximately 100.75 units (127, 80, 78, 118). To mitigate consistent stockouts and capture this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to focus on the current recovery trend. Sigma_hat is set to the same window (N=4) to account for the high variance (range 78-127). The OR backend's service level logic (q=0.5 since profit=$1 and holding cost=$1) will target the median demand, but the capped policy will allow for higher orders given the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after the P42-P44 low, the P45-P48 recovery shows a mean demand of ~101 units, returning to the high-demand regime levels observed in P36-P41.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility and a return to a high-demand regime after a brief 'cliff' in Periods 42-44. Periods 45-49 have seen demand levels of 127, 80, 78, 118, and 141, resulting in four stockouts in the last five periods. The average demand for this most recent 5-period active window (P45-P49) is approximately 108.8 units, which aligns with the previous high-demand regime observed from P36-P41 (avg ~98). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), which results in a critical ratio (Z-score) target near 0.5 (where base stock \u2248 mean demand), and the high volatility where demand frequently spikes above the recent mean, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this high-demand recovery and set sigma_hat using the same window to account for the significant variance (range 78 to 141). This should ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the current spikes and reduces stockout frequency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovered P45-P49: average demand ~109 units following the P42-P44 cliff, restoring levels seen in the P36-P41 high-demand phase (~98). High volatility persists with frequent stockouts.
