{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) exhibits a clear cyclical pattern with peaks around 165-170 units and troughs around 80-90 units, occurring in waves of approximately 8-10 periods. We are currently in the retreat phase of the fifth cycle. After a peak in Period 43 (166 units), demand has been trending downwards: P44 (132), P45 (129), P46 (140), P47 (76), P48 (128), and P49 (98). The average demand over the last three periods (P47-P49) is 100.6 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the order arrives and is used to satisfy demand in the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units. To satisfy expected demand while avoiding excessive holding costs during this retreat phase, I will target a stock level of approximately 110-115 units. This provides a safety buffer against the volatility observed in P48 (128) while respecting the downward trend. Order = Target (115) - On-hand (32) = 83.",
