Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data or inventory. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a holding cost of $1.0 and profit of $4.0, suggesting a high service level is preferred. Based on the provided demand history (75, 138, 134, 122, 111), the mean demand is approximately 116 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we are at the start, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full provided historical context for the mean and standard deviation calculations, assuming the provided historical samples are representative of the starting regime.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 138 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods works for now. Ending inventory was 48 units after a demand of 90. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], with a mean of 116. Period 1's actual demand was 90. Since we are in the very early stages (Period 2), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the provided samples) to establish a baseline for demand mean and volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile), which supports maintaining higher inventory levels to avoid stockouts. I will stick with the default (promised) lead time of 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Periods 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples are: P1=90, P2=79. Additional historical samples provided (P1=75, P2=138, P3=134, P4=122, P5=111) suggest a higher average (~116) than observed in the first two active periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical fractile is 0.8, favoring a service-level-oriented inventory position. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat (averaging 84.5) to capture recent local demand while ensuring sigma_hat reflects the volatility from the full history to protect against the higher historical spikes (e.g., 138). With L=0, the target base stock is (1+0)*mu + z*sigma.

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 90, Period 2 was 79, and Period 3 was 84. The provided demand samples for Period 1-5 (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) seem to conflict with the 'conclude' messages in the 'GAME HISTORY' section. I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' section as it represents the ground truth of what actually occurred in the simulation. Mean demand from the history is (90 + 79 + 84) / 3 = 84.3. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments so far (Periods 1, 2, and 3) have arrived with an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently low (23 units on-hand), and there are no units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since the 0-period lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 3 available historical data points to establish a stable baseline.

=== Period 4 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $356.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand significantly spiked to 141 units (a ~60% increase from the previous average of ~84), resulting in a stockout (89 sold, 0 ending inventory). The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. To prevent further lost sales and capture this upward shift in demand, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent high demand more heavily. Using a base-stock level that reflects the recent peak ensures better service levels given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we experienced a stockout because the demand (141) significantly exceeded the starting inventory (89), which was limited by the OR backend's cap. The historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) had a mean of 116, but actual observed demand in-game (90, 79, 84, 141, 107) averages around 100. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. To prevent future stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed (especially the jump from ~80 to 141), I will use the recent_N method for demand and volatility. N=5 covers all available in-game data, which helps the model adjust to the higher peak demand seen in Period 4. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the game history shows a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the first 6 periods has been: 90, 79, 84, 141 (stockout occurred), 107, 105. The mean demand is approximately 101 units per period. The spike in Period 4 (141) caused a stockout, suggesting significant volatility. Given the current on-hand inventory of 17 units and 0 in-transit, I need to ensure the base stock covers Period 7's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution, which includes the high-demand outlier from Period 4 to maintain a slightly higher service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the demand history (90, 79, 84, 141, 107, 105, 75), the mean demand for the first 7 periods is approximately 97.2 units. There was a significant spike in Period 4 (141) which resulted in a stockout (sold 89, ending inventory 0), but demand has since stabilized around the 100-unit mark. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Given the consistent 0-period lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the average is stable enough that using a 'recent_N' of 5 periods (Periods 3-7: 84, 141, 107, 105, 75) captures the recent volatility while providing a mean of 102.4. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent high variance caused by the Period 4 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1. Analyzing the historical demand (including the provided seed data and the 8 actualized periods), we observe demand values: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (seed) and 90, 79, 84, 141 (stockout), 107, 105, 75, 79 (actualized). The demand appears relatively stable with occasional spikes, like the 141 in Period 4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period for all 8 cycles. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain this observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the full observed history) to capture the most relevant demand distribution for this 0-lead-time environment, ensuring we cover the immediate demand + safety stock while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the first 9 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 94.2 and a standard deviation of 20.8. In Period 4, demand spiked to 141, causing a stockout as inventory was depleted. Since then, demand has returned to the 75-105 range (Avg ~86 over the last 5 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure we cover demand for Period 10 (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the full history while giving appropriate weight to recent levels, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on the full volatility observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 10 periods, ranging between 61 and 141 units. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the 5 initial samples) is approximately 98.2 units, while the mean of the actual demand in the first 10 periods of play is 90.9 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 4, there was a stockout due to a demand spike (141 vs avg ~90), resulting in lost sales. Current on-hand inventory is 54 units. To optimize for a service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution more accurately than the long-term history, acknowledging the high volatility (sigma) observed in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by 11 consecutive periods of same-day arrivals. Historical demand from both the seed data (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) and the game history (90, 79, 84, 141 (stockout), 107, 105, 75, 79, 88, 61, 69) indicates a mean demand of approximately 95.8 units per period (combined average). However, the most recent 5 periods (Periods 7-11) show a lower average demand of 74.4 units compared to the earlier periods. Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 41 units with no in-transit orders. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects more recent volatility and mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~100 to ~75 units per period. Promised lead time of 0 is consistently actualized.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a sudden demand spike of 133 units, which depleted the on-hand inventory to 0 and caused stockouts (only 83 units sold). This spike contrasts with the lower demand regime observed from Period 7 to 11 (average ~75). Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently actualized, the system will order to meet the base stock immediately. Because of the recent volatility (the sudden spike after a period of low demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture both the recent low-demand regime and the latest spike, ensuring mu_hat reflects a more balanced average (approx 84 units) and sigma_hat accounts for the increased variance. This approach prevents over-responding to one spike while still raising the service level to avoid another stockout in Period 13.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 and 13, demand spiked significantly to 133 and 138 units, respectively, following a period of lower demand (~75 units). This surge has resulted in stockouts (0 ending inventory) for two consecutive periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable. Given this abrupt shift in demand behavior, using a long-term average would result in under-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent upward trend (P11: 69, P12: 133, P13: 138), centering the forecast on this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this spike. L remains at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12: Average demand increased sharply from ~75 to ~135 units (+80%), causing stockouts in P12 and P13.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of recent history confirms a demand regime shift that began in Period 12. Demands for P12-P14 were 133, 138, and 117 respectively, averaging ~129 units per period. This is a significant increase from the ~75 unit average seen between P7 and P11, which caused stockouts in P12 and P13. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. To capture this new higher-demand regime and prevent further stockouts while accounting for natural variance, I am using a recent_N window of 3 periods (P12-P14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand levels rather than the historical lower average.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 12. Initially averaging ~100 (P1-P6) and then dropping to ~75 (P7-P11), it has now increased to a higher level. The last four periods (P12-P15) show demand values of 133, 138, 117, and 118, averaging approximately 126.5 units per period. The Carry-over insights successfully flagged this uptick, which caused stockouts in Period 12 and 13. My goal is to calibrate the OR backend to this new higher demand level while maintaining the L=0 policy, as lead times are consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically capture the stats of this current high-demand regime (P12-P15), ensuring the base stock level (calculated using the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) is sufficient to prevent further stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12 confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~126 units (P12-P15 observations: 133, 138, 117, 118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged unexpectedly to 161 units (the highest in the history of the game), resulting in another stockout with ending inventory at 0. Analyzing the current demand regime starting at Period 12, the values are: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161. This averages 133.4 units per period with significant variability (Std Dev \u2248 17.5). The earlier insight of stabilization at 126 is now outdated given the recent spike. I will use a N=5 (the length of the current regime) to capture this higher mean and volatility. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently actualized, so I will maintain L=0. By targeting a base stock that accounts for the recent average (approx. 133) plus a safety buffer for the high variance, the system should prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand volatility within the Period 12 regime has increased; recent demand (P16=161) suggests an upward trend or higher variance than previously recorded (avg increased from 126 to 133).

Daily Reward (R_t): $471.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis confirms a regime shift that started in Period 12. Although the average demand since P12 is approximately 132 units, recent periods (P16-P17) show heightened volatility (161 and 124 units). Period 17's demand of 124 units suggests the market remains at this elevated level but with significant variation. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. To ensure sufficient stock for this higher-demand, high-volatility regime, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, N=6 covers the period from P12 onwards (demand samples: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124), capturing the current mean. For sigma_hat, the same N=6 is chosen to reflect the recent increase in demand variance, which is critical to avoid the stockouts observed in P12, P13, and P16. The backend OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that protects against a service level target of 80% (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 12. Since P12, observed demand values have been: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, and 138. The mean of this specific regime (P12-P18, N=7) is approximately 132.7 units per period. Using N=7 for mu_hat centers the forecast on this currently active regime and accounts for the increased volatility (sigma) observed since the shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised, based on the history of same-period arrivals (e.g., P18 ordered 121, arrived 121 in P18). Current on-hand inventory is low (8 units), requiring a base stock that covers the expected 133 units for Period 19 plus safety stock for the high variance seen in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime starting P12 remains active with a mean of ~133 units and notable volatility (range 117-161).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a higher and more volatile regime since Period 12. Looking at the last 8 periods (P12-P19), the demand observations are: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, and 102. This results in a mean of approximately 128.8 units. The period 19 demand (102) is the lowest in this regime but follows several periods of high demand, suggesting the volatility remains significant (standard deviation approx 17.8). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. To accurately capture this most recent stable yet volatile regime, I will use a window of N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent mean shift against the observed variance. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, meaning we want the base stock to cover demand with high probability to avoid the stockouts seen in P12, P13, and P16.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) remains within the regime that began at Period 12, though recent demand has softened. In the last 9 periods (P12-P20), demand has averaged 125.1 units, with observations of 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138, 102, and 95. The most recent three periods (P18-P20) show a localized decrease (avg 111.7 units), with Period 20's demand at 95. However, due to the high volatility previously seen (e.g., P16 demand of 161), I will use the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture the full mean and variance of this current high-demand regime while allowing the recent lower values to naturally weight the forecast downward. The lead time L=0 has been consistently reliable throughout. Setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we cover the current regime since P12 without over-reacting to the minor recent dip or the previous outlier peak.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began at Period 12 (approx. 133 units/period) appears to have shifted downward starting around Period 19. The last three periods show demand values of 102, 95, and 90, which are significantly lower than the P12-P18 average of ~133. This suggests a new stabilization around 95-100 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility in this SKU, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current downward trend. Sigma_hat will use a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the overall volatility seen in the post-P12 data. L will remain at default as lead time 0 is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift starting Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~133 to ~96 units (last 3 observations: 102, 95, 90).

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following the Period 12-18 high-demand phase (avg ~133), demand from Period 19 to 22 has significantly dropped and stabilized at a lower level (102, 95, 90, 89), averaging approximately 94 units. This represents a sustained 4-period decrease of ~30%. Therefore, I am resetting the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using recent_N with N=4 to capture this new regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message to date. On-hand inventory is currently low (24), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level required for this new, lower demand mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~133 to ~94 units (-30%) over the last 4 periods (P19-P22).

In Period 23, the actual demand was 113, which is higher than the average of the lower-demand regime (approximately 94 units) observed between Periods 19 and 22. This suggests that while there was a significant decrease starting at Period 19, the volatility remains high, and demand can still spike above 110 units. The stockout at the end of Period 23 (ending inventory 0) confirms that the aggressive reduction in safety stock in the previous period was premature. I will continue using the recent regime (last 5 periods, P19-P23) to calculate mu_hat, which results in a mean of 97.8 units per period. I am choosing N=5 for sigma_hat as well to capture the recent volatility increase (std deviation is approximately 10.2). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all past 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the low-regime starting P19 is notable; Period 23 demand (113) exceeded the previous 4-period average by 20%, resulting in a stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, a significant demand spike occurred (155 units), far exceeding the recent 'low-regime' average (approx. 94 units observed P19-P22). This follows a previous spike in P23 (113 units). Combined, this suggests the 'low-regime' starting at P19 has ended and demand has shifted back to a high-demand regime similar to or even more volatile than the P12-P18 period (avg ~133). Due to two consecutive stockouts (P23, P24), on-hand inventory is 0. I will prioritize service level by setting mu_hat using the last 6 observations (P19-P24), which yields a mean of 107.3, but I will explicitly increase the forecast to 135 to account for the clear upward trend and to prevent further stockouts. The lead time L is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 23: Demand has returned to high levels (avg ~134 units over last 2 periods), ending the low-demand plateau observed P19-P22.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has confirmed a return to a high-demand regime starting Period 23. The last three periods (P23-P25) recorded demands of 113, 155, and 139 respectively, averaging 135.6 units. This follows a temporary dip (P19-P22) where demand averaged ~94. The high-demand regime seen prior to that dip (P12-P18) averaged 133 units, suggesting we have returned to that established level or slightly higher. Given the recent stockouts in P23 and P24 and the high criticality (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this immediate rebound while ensuring the OR engine maintains a high service level. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime return confirmed starting Period 23: Average demand 135.6 (P23-P25), consistent with the P12-P18 regime (~133 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to the high-demand regime that was first established in Period 12. Since Period 23, demand values have been 113, 155, 139, and 101. While Period 26's demand of 101 is slightly lower, it remains consistent with the broader high-demand regime characterized by a mean around 130-135 and significant volatility. The current state shows 53 units on hand with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, matching the promised lead time. To capture the current regime's mean while accounting for recent high-variance spikes (like the 155 in P24), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, covering the data since the return to the high level in Period 23. This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock sufficient to meet a service level of 80% (profit $4 / ($4+$1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand dropped significantly to 43 units, which is much lower than the active high-demand regime average (~135 units). However, this is only a single data point and could be an outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. We have observed high volatility in this SKU before (e.g., P23 at 113, P24 at 155, P26 at 101). Because the system is conservative and requires 3+ periods of evidence for a new regime, I will maintain the high-demand forecast but use a slightly larger N for mu_hat (N=5) to incorporate the recent drop without overreacting. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand inventory is high (105) due to the low demand in P27, so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size based on the base stock minus inventory logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 and 28, demand for chips(Regular) dropped significantly to 43 and 10 units respectively, following a high-demand regime that averaged ~135 units. This suggests a new demand regime shift or a temporary seasonal collapse. Given the sharp decline (over 90% drop from the previous mean), using a long-term average would result in excessive overstocking and high holding costs. I am switching to a recent_N approach with N=3 (encompassing P26-P28: 101, 43, 10) to capture this downward trend aggressively. The average demand of these three periods is 51.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Setting mu_hat to reflect this lower demand while maintaining a sigma_hat that accounts for the high historical volatility to protect against a sudden rebound.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 27: Average demand decreased sharply from ~135 to ~27 units (P27=43, P28=10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, demand spiked back to 89 units after two extremely low periods (43 and 10). This indicates that the sharp drop observed at Period 27 was likely a short-lived anomaly rather than a sustained regime shift, or that demand is experiencing high volatility. The average demand across P27-P29 is 47.3 units. However, looking at the history of 'chips(Regular)', the product frequently cycles between a 'high' regime (~135 units) and a 'low' regime (~75-90 units). Given the sudden jump back to 89, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of this volatile period (approx 47 units per period, or 94 for mu_hat since L=0 and mu_hat=(1+L)*mean). To protect against further upward spikes (like the jump from 10 to 89), I will set sigma_hat explicitly based on the standard deviation of recent periods to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: The sharp demand drop at P27-P28 (avg 26.5) was followed by a return to 89 units in P29, suggesting high volatility or a rapid return to the previous low-demand regime (~90 units).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a potential stabilization around the 80-90 unit mark. P27-P28 showed an extreme drop (avg ~26), but P29 (89) and P30 (71) suggest the demand is recovering toward a low-to-moderate regime. The average of the most recent four periods (P27-P30: 43, 10, 89, 71) is approximately 53 units, but this is heavily skewed by the extreme lows of P27 and P28. Looking specifically at the last two periods, the average is 80. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent shift while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed return to higher demand levels. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened variance seen in this transition. Lead time L is set to calculated as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand appears to be stabilizing at a moderate regime (avg ~80 units over P29-P30) following a severe but brief dip in P27-P28.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate regime following a volatile period. Observations from P29 to P31 (89, 71, 57) yield an average demand of approximately 72 units. While P27 and P28 saw a dramatic drop (43, 10), the recovery to the 60-90 range suggests we should focus on the most recent 3 periods to set our parameters. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stabilization. The actual lead time remains 0, consistent with the promised lead time. This approach balances the risk of another sudden demand shift while ensuring enough stock is available for the current moderate demand level (avg ~72).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at moderate regime: Average demand for P29-P31 is 72.3 units, following the extreme volatility of P27-P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new lower-demand regime following the volatility seen between Periods 27-29. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has been 89, 71, 57, and 22, averaging approximately 60 units. The most recent observation (P32 = 22) suggests a further downward drift or significant variance. Lead time is consistently 0. I will adjust the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this moderate-to-low regime and avoid over-ordering based on older, higher-demand history. Using N=4 balances the need to react to the recent dip (22 units) while acknowledging the somewhat higher demand preceding it.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29 confirmed: Average demand has decreased to ~60 units (P29-P32: 89, 71, 57, 22), significantly lower than the P23-P26 average of ~135.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower and more volatile regime since Period 29. Recent observations (P29-P33) are 89, 71, 57, 22, and 67, resulting in a mean of 61.2 units per period. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~135 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliably actualized across all historical data. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (80th percentile). Currently, on-hand inventory is 17 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new lower-demand plateau while accounting for the significant variance observed (ranging from 22 to 89).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29 stabilized: Average demand is 61.2 units (P29-P33) with high volatility (range 22-89).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 29, following a period of extreme volatility (P27-P28). The average demand from P29 to P34 is approximately 61.3 units (89, 71, 57, 22, 67, 62). While the last two periods (67, 62) are stable, the earlier periods showed significant variation. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P29-P34). The service level target remains high due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P29 has stabilized around a mean of ~61 units (P29-P34 observations), with volatility significantly lower than the preceding high-demand period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate regime starting Period 29. The average demand over the last seven periods (P29-P35) is approximately 60.8 units (89, 71, 57, 22, 67, 62, 58). While there was significant volatility initially (range 22-89), the last three observations (67, 62, 58) show much tighter clustering around the mean. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime's mean and volatility while excluding the prior high-demand period. This should provide sufficient stock to cover the expected demand of ~61 units plus a safety buffer for remaining volatility without incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P29 is now firmly established with a mean of ~61 units; volatility has decreased significantly over the last three periods (P33-P35).

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent uptick in Period 36 (90 units) compared to the established mean of ~61 units observed since Period 29. This follows a period of stability (P33-P35) and resulted in a minor stockout in Period 36. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the optimal service level is 80%. I am transitioning the mu_hat estimation to use only the last 8 periods (P29-P36) to capture the current moderate-to-low demand regime while accounting for the recent spike. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory calculation to a single-period coverage. Setting N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced estimate of the current regime's mean (approx 63.3) and volatility, helping to prevent future stockouts if demand remains at the higher end of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility within the post-P29 regime increased in P36 (90 units), breaking a three-period streak of stability around ~60 units and causing a stockout.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a significant upward shift from the previous 'moderate' regime (~61 units). The observed demand in Period 36 was 90 and in Period 37 was 120, both causing stockouts. This indicates the start of a new high-demand regime or a intense seasonal spike for 'chips(Regular)'. Given the stockouts (on-hand is 0), the priority is to aggressively replenish. I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (P35-P37: 58, 90, 120) to capture this surge. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Average demand has surged from ~61 to ~105 units (P36=90, P37=120), indicating a return to high-demand levels and causing consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-demand regime. After a period of lower demand (~61 units), the last three periods (P36-P38) have shown demands of 90, 120, and 95, averaging 101.7 units. This volatility led to stockouts in P36 and P37. The current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and protect against the high volatility observed (std dev of P36-P38 is approx 16), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to prioritize the new high-demand level while maintaining the L=0 default. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level to satisfy this higher demand pattern immediately.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Recent 3-period average (P36-P38) is 101.7 units, compared to the P29-P35 average of ~61 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-demand regime starting at Period 36. The last four periods of demand (P36-P39) are 90, 120, 95, and 117, resulting in a mean of 105.5 units. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (avg ~61). We have experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in P36, P37, and P39 because the previous parameters were tuned for lower demand. I am setting mu_hat to reflect this new regime using an explicit forecast of 106 units per period (1+L=1). I am also using explicit sigma_hat set to 15 to account for the observed volatility within this new high-demand segment (range 90-120). The lead time remains consistently 0, so L=0 is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: High-demand regime (starting P36) is sustained over 4 periods with a mean of 105.5 units (P36-P39) and a range of 90-120 units. Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 36. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has been 90, 120, 95, 117, and 99, resulting in a mean of 104.2 units per period. This regime is significantly higher than the previous P29-P35 average of ~61 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this sustained high-demand level and prevent further stockouts (observed in P36, P37, and P39), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this current regime. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) justifies a relatively high service level, which these parameters will help the OR backend maintain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $229.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 36 has stabilized at a high level. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has been 90, 120, 95, 117, 99, 69, resulting in a mean of 98.3 units. While Period 41 showed a dip to 69 units, previous history suggests this is likely volatility within the high-demand regime rather than a new downward shift. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This setting allows the OR backend to target a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer for the observed variance, minimizing stockouts like those seen in P36, P37, and P39.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: High-demand regime (starting P36) is maintained with a 6-period average of 98.3 units (range 69-120). Evidence of high volatility remains present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-115.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand was 0, which is a significant outlier within the current high-demand regime starting at Period 36 (previously averaging ~105 units). However, this may be a reporting delay or a temporary extreme fluctuation rather than a permanent regime shift, as previous periods (P36-P41) showed sustained high demand ranging from 69 to 120. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to a single 'zero' data point while acknowledging the increased volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the regime from P36-P42) to incorporate the zero demand while maintaining a buffer for the expected return to high demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to capture the spike in volatility caused by the P42 observation.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand dropped to 0 in Period 42, creating extreme short-term volatility within the high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~105). Monitoring for a potential regime downward shift or data anomaly.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, demand dropped to 0 for the second consecutive period, following a period (P41) of 69 units. This suggests a significant regime shift away from the high-demand level (~100 units) observed between P36-P41. The current on-hand inventory is 119 units. Given the recent zero-demand observations (P42, P43) and the preceding 69 (P41), the new 3-period average is 23 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp downturn and prevent excessive inventory accumulation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 42: Demand has dropped to 0 for two consecutive periods (P42-P43) following a decline in P41 (69), indicating a sharp break from the previous high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand returned to a moderate level (41 units) after two consecutive periods of zero demand (P42-P43). This confirms that the zero-demand periods were likely a temporary anomaly or a brief holiday-related lull rather than a permanent regime shift to zero. However, the demand of 41 is significantly lower than the high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~105). Given the proximity to the end of the game (Period 45 of 50) and current on-hand inventory of 78 units, I am adopting a conservative 'recent_N' approach. Using N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 incorporates the two 0s and the 41 (avg ~13.6), which will prevent over-ordering while we have 78 units on hand. Setting L to 'calculate' to maintain the confirmed 0-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the extreme volatility of the last few periods (99, 69, 0, 0, 41) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: The demand drop in P42-P43 (0 units) was followed by a moderate demand of 41 in P44. This suggests a transition to a lower-demand regime or a period of high volatility following the high-demand regime of P36-P41.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility following a period of zero demand in P42-P43. After dropping to 0, demand returned to 41 in P44 and then surged to 127 in P45, resulting in a stockout. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P42-P45) is 42 units, but this is heavily skewed by the zeros. The regime starting P36 had a mean of ~105, while the regime starting P29 was ~61. Given the sudden rebound to 127 in P45, it is likely the zero-demand periods were outliers or a very brief dip rather than a sustained shift to zero. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to balance the high-demand regime metrics with the recent cooling, but I will use a larger sigma_hat (explicitly set) to account for the extreme volatility (0 to 127 range) and prevent further stockouts. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High demand volatility remains; demand surged from 0 (P43) to 127 (P45), indicating the zero-demand period (P42-P43) was temporary, but requiring high safety stock to handle the swing.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility following a brief drop to zero in P42-P43. Demand jumped to 127 in P45 and was 80 in P46. The Carry-over Insights (starting P46) suggest that the zero-demand period was a temporary anomaly and that the regime remains high-vairance. Given the current on-hand inventory of 38 and the lead time remaining consistently 0, I need to set parameters that cover the potential for another high-demand spike. The average demand since P36 (excluding the two zero-demand periods) is approximately 97 units. Using recent_N with N=11 (covering the period since the last major regime shift in P36) will capture this high volatility and provide a safer base stock to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the recent lower observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility in the current regime (P42-P47), with values bouncing between 0 and 127. Following the high-demand period (P36-P41, avg ~105), the last six periods (P42-P47) have an average demand of 54.3 units, including the sharp 0-demand drop and subsequent recovery. Given the most recent four observations (41, 127, 80, 78) average 81.5 units, I am transitioning the forecast to a 'moderate' level rather than sticking to the earlier high-demand average or the extremely low 0-demand outliers. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg 65.2) and sigma_hat will capture this recent stabilization while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the inherent volatility of this SKU. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime has transitioned from the high-demand state (P36-P41) into a volatile moderate state. The 5-period average (P43-P47) is 65.2 units, but with a range of 0 to 127, indicating high variance persisting despite lower mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a temporary drop to zero (P42-P43), demand rebounded to 127 (P45), and the most recent demand (P48) was 118, resulting in a stockout. The regime starting at P43 (after the zero-demand dip) has a mean of 88.8 units (P44-P48: 41, 127, 80, 78, 118). However, the variance is significant. Given we are at Period 49/50, and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (4:1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P44-P48) to reflect this volatile moderate-to-high state. I'm using an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent another stockout in the final periods, as stockouts have been frequent due to these sudden swings. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; the transition from the P42-P43 dip resulted in a volatile regime with a mean of ~89 units (P44-P48). High safety stock is required to mitigate frequent stockouts caused by demand spikes (e.g., P45=127, P48=118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile in the current regime (starting around Period 44). Recent periods show demand levels of 80, 78, 118, and 141, averaging approximately 104 units over requested recent observations, but with significant swings (P45 was 127, P43 was 0). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the stockout in P49 (demand 141). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the return to high-demand levels similar to the P36-P41 regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P44-P49) to capture this moderate-to-high volatile state. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the recent peaks (118-141) while accounting for the significant variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime return confirmed P46-P49: Average demand has returned to ~104 units with high volatility (range 78-141) following the volatile dip in P42-P44.
