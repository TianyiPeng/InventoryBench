Historical data for the first five periods shows demand values of 88, 148, 80, 84, and 103, resulting in an average demand of approximately 101 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to satisfy the current period's demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover Period 1's demand (which occurs after the decision) while minimizing holding costs. Since the average demand is around 100 and the first data point was 88, ordering 100 units provides a reasonable buffer for Period 1. If lead time 0 holds, these 100 units will arrive to meet Period 1's demand.",

Period 2 specifically had a historical demand of 148. Given that I have only 1 unit on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to cover Period 2's expected demand. Using the historical Period 2 demand (148) as a target, and accounting for the 1 unit existing, I will order 147 units to meet the likely 148 demand.

To meet the expected demand of ~100 units for Period 4 while minimizing end-of-period inventory, I need to order enough to reach a total of approximately 101-105 units (providing a small buffer).
