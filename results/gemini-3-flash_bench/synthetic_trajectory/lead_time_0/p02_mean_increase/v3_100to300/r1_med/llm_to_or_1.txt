Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profitability of $4 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should ideally arrive within the same period's arrival resolution phase. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (88, 148, 80, 84, 103), with a mean of 100.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 27.9. Since there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order to meet the immediate demand of Period 1 and maintain a buffer. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (all available samples) to capture the initial demand distribution for the first base stock calculation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the actual lead time was 0 periods (ordered and arrived in Period 1), which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 99 units. Historical demand across the last 5 periods (including Period 1) shows a sequence of [88, 148, 80, 84, 103] with an average of approximately 100.6 units. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fact that we currently only have 26 units on hand, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Since L=0, we are looking at 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent volatility while recognizing the mean is relatively stable around 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand has been very stable, with Period 1 at 99 units and Period 2 at 100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Given the lead time of 0, the order arrives within the same period. To maximize reward while minimizing holding cost, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the observed demand (approx 100). Since L=0, mu_hat effectively covers one period of demand (1+0). I'll use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate behavior while maintaining a high service level through the OR engine's internal z-score calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 99, Period 2 was 100, and Period 3 was 99. The provided historical list for chips(Regular) (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) seems slightly disconnected from the actual 'conclude' messages which show a very stable demand around 99-100 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (2 units), so we need to order to meet the immediate demand of Period 4. Given the extreme stability in the 'conclude' messages (99, 100, 99), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this local stability for mu_hat and sigma_hat, setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-day lead time pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 6. Reviewing history: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), though the prompt notes a promised lead time of 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with historical samples of 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (from the provided demand data) and concluded outcomes showing demand around 99-104 units in the last 4 periods. The Period 4 conclude message shows demand was 104, but only 100 units were available (starting 2 + arrived 98), leading to a stockout (sold 100, ending inventory 0). Since inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock covers current period demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand levels (~100 units/period) and 'calculate' for lead time since 0-day arrival is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first five periods with a mean of approximately 98.4 units and a standard deviation of about 5.2. Period 4 saw a slight stockout where demand (104) exceeded starting on-hand inventory (100) because the previous period's ending inventory was low. Based on the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since demand is stable and there are no clear changepoints or seasonal triggers identified in the generic period labels, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime's characteristics. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer based on the 0.8 critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we experienced a stockout as demand (131) exceeded starting on-hand inventory (103), which was composed of the existing inventory (13) plus the same-day arrival (90). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 104 units per period (samples: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103, 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131). The promised lead time is 0, and 'conclude' messages confirm that arrivals consistently occur within the same period (L=0). However, recent demand demonstrates high volatility (P2=148, P6=131). To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6), which captures the recent high-demand spike while balancing the average. mu_hat will represent (1+L) * mean, which our OR engine will use to replenish stock to meet the next period's needs fully.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 7 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility with an average around 100 units (99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71). The high demand in Period 6 (131) caused a stockout, while Period 7 saw a significant drop (71). Given this fluctuation, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trends while smoothing out the extreme high/low samples. Since L=0, the backend will calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat for a coverage period of (1+L) = 1 period. This should help balance the high profit ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0) by maintaining a responsive stock level.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent across Periods 1-7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean shifting upwards with high volatility. History highlights that the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to utilize. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged approximately 100 units (99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71, 107), but the variance is notable, particularly with the spike in Period 6 (131). To ensure sufficient stock for potential high-demand periods while managing the $1.0 holding cost, I'm setting L to explicit 0 to reflect the realized lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N=5 to capture the recent volatility and mean (approx. 100). The game history also shows we've run out of stock in Periods 4 and 6, so maintaining a slightly more responsive buffer based on the most recent 5 samples is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $435.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the first 9 periods has shown some variability but remains within a relatively stable range (mean ~101.3). Comparing the first 5 periods (mean ~98.4) to the full set (mean ~101.3), there is no strong evidence of a significant regime shift, although Period 6 saw a spike (131). With an ending inventory of 9 units and lead time of 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the current period's demand. Profit is $4 and Holding Cost is $1, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84), favoring a slightly higher service level. I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to capture the slight uptick in demand and volatility observed in Period 6 onwards.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 104.3 units (ranging from 71 to 131). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals matching the period ordered. In Period 10, demand (131) exceeded starting on-hand inventory (115), resulting in stockouts. To maximize reward, I need to ensure the base stock covers current period demand (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of demand coverage) while accounting for volatility to prevent lost sales. I will use the recent 10-period average for demand and volatility to capture the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a relatively stable pattern with some fluctuations. Based on history from Period 1 to 11, the average demand is approximately 103.8 units per period (sum: 1142 / 11). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, which simplifies inventory management. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the overall trend, which is slightly higher than the initial seed data. Given the stockouts in Period 4, 6, and 10 where demand exceeded inventory (max demand seen was 131), setting parameters to cover roughly 120-130 units per period is appropriate to balance the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1). The backend will apply a service level based on the cost-criticality ratio (4/(4+1) = 0.8), but manual adjustments via N selection help ensure we don't under-order during peak spikes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 completed periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of 16.5 units over the last 12 periods (Samples: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71, 107, 111, 131, 99, 112). Period 12 ended with 7 units on-hand. Since lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 13 arrive and satisfy Period 13 demand. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability while filtering out the initial pre-game samples (Period 1-5 mean was lower). This will target a base stock level that covers the current period's expected demand and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since the beginning, with mean demand hovering around 105 units (calculated from Period 1 to 13: mean=105.3, std=15.9). The carry-over insight confirms that the actual lead time is 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. This means orders arrive in the same period they are placed, helping minimize lost sales which occurred in Periods 4, 6, and 10 when demand spiked and starting inventory was insufficient. Given the stable demand pattern, I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (all confirmed periods after the initial seeding) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the observed standard deviation while targeting a service level influenced by the $4 profit to $1 holding cost ratio (q \u2248 0.8).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the simulation, matching the promised lead time. Demand has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts, though frequent stockouts (Periods 4, 6, 10, 14) suggest the order quantities are slightly under-covering the variance. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-14) is approximately 107 units per period. In Period 14, demand was 128 units, resulting in a stockout. I will set L to 0 (default) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the stable demand mean while ensuring the variability that periodically causes stockouts is adequately reflected in the safety stock calculation. The OR backend's default service level based on the Profit ($4) and Holding Cost ($1) ratio is 80%, which I will supplement with a robust sigma estimate.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 15. Demand is stable but exhibits frequent stockouts (Periods 4, 6, 10, 14) and high demand peaks (e.g., 131 units in Periods 6 and 10), indicating that the existing ordering strategy is slightly under-estimating peak demand. The current mean of demand since Period 1 is approximately 106.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand volatility (approx. mean 110.8) and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover these high-demand events without excessive holding costs, especially since the lead time is zero and orders arrive immediately to meet current period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 280, more than double the previous average of ~107. This suggests a potential regime shift or a significant one-off event. Since the product is 'chips(Regular)', this could be the start of a holiday period or a major sporting event. Given the stockout in Period 16 (sold only 126 units), I need to increase the base stock immediately. Lead time (L) is confirmed at 0. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast that reflects the suspected new demand level; while the mean of all samples is ~108, the most recent observation is 280. I will set mu_hat (for 1+L=1 period) to a value that balances the historical average with this new spike, targeted at 180 to avoid massive overstocking if it was a fluke, but providing better coverage than the default. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly higher to 60 to reflect increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (280 units vs ~107 avg), suggesting a potential regime shift or seasonal event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a significantly elevated demand regime. Period 16 saw demand jump to 280, and Period 17 followed with 289. Prior to this, demand averaged around 107. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory ran out in both Period 16 and 17, indicating we are under-ordering for this new peak. To capture this shift while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to focus exclusively on the high-demand periods (16 and 17), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with the demand jump. The OR backend will use these to calculate a higher base stock (q=0.8) to meet this new demand levels and avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-17 avg 284 units (+165% vs previous baseline). Lead time remains 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Previous demand averaged ~107 units, but the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) recorded demands of 280, 289, and 280 respectively. This confirms a stable high-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order P18 arrived in P18). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this new mean (~283) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to adjust for the variance in this specific high-demand window. This will ensure the base stock levels (order-up-to) are sufficient to cover the current demand peak and minimize lost sales, while accounting for the immediate arrival (L=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1032.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 19, the values are: 280, 289, 280, and 264. This yields an average demand of 278.25 units per period for this new high-demand regime, compared to the previous average of approximately 107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent arrival messages. To account for this new sustained demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture exactly this new regime (Period 16-19). I am also using 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific period. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the system uses the observed 0-period lead time. This strategy aims to maintain a high service level for the elevated demand while minimizing stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg demand increased from ~107 to ~278 (+160%). Current high-demand regime length: 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1152.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted dramatically starting at Period 16. In the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 287 units (280, 289, 280, 264, 322), compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 107 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To respond to this significant and sustained increase in both volume and volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that prevents stockouts, which occurred in Periods 16, 17, and 20 due to underestimating the shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P20) average demand established at 287 units, a ~168% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a ~107 units/period baseline to a significantly higher mean. Examining the demand for Periods 16-21 (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203), the average for this 6-period regime is approximately 273 units, though Period 21 showed a dip to 203. To account for this new, more volatile, high-demand level, I am using recent_N with N=6 (the length of the new regime). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 21 conclude' and historical insights. Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this 6-period window ensures the base stock reflects the current environment while protecting against the observed volatility (ranging from 203 to 322), which is crucial given the high profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) that favors higher service levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a verified regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 22, the average demand is approximately 283 units (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336), compared to the pre-shift average of ~107. Period 22 demand was high at 336 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the high-demand regime is now 7 periods long, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific volatility and mean. Given L=0, the backend will target a base stock covering one period of demand (1+L=1). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the historical 0-period lead time trend.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) continues through P22: average demand is ~283 units with significant volatility (range 203-336). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~107 units to ~282 units. Since Period 16 (8 periods total), the demand values have been: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282. The average of this high-demand regime is 284.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 41.5. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this new regime while maintaining a high service level (given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a critical ratio of 0.8), I am using the most recent 8 samples (N=8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained high volume and the increased volatility observed since the shift, minimizing stockouts which have occurred frequently during this spike.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 107 units. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-24), the average demand has increased to approximately 278.4 units, representing a ~160% increase. The current high-demand regime has now persisted for 9 periods. Recent demand (P16-P24) values are: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282, 315. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). To capture this sustained higher demand level and account for the observed volatility within this new regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9, corresponding to the start of the regime shift). L will remain at the promised lead time of 0 as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) confirmed through Period 24: average demand is ~278 units (vs ~107 baseline) with high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~107 units to a high-demand state. For the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 295.6 units with a standard deviation of 47.9. The most recent demand (P25) reached a peak of 375 units, causing a stockout as 'Starting on-hand' (319) was insufficient. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variance accurately while discarding the low-demand data pre-Period 16. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the 0-period lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer based on recent volatility, aiming to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in periods 16-25.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 295.6 (P16-P25) from ~107 baseline; Period 25 shows peak demand of 375 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged approximately 107 units. Since Period 16 (11 periods ago), demand has increased substantially, averaging approximately 291 units (P16-P26 range: 203 to 375). Despite the high demand, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. For Period 27, I will continue using the high-demand regime (N=11) to stabilize the mean forecast (mu_hat) and capture the increased volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this period. The profit-to-holding cost ratio remains high (4:1), meaning the OR backend will target a high service level (80th percentile). Given the 0-period lead time, the system will order enough to meet the base stock target within the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to ~291 (P16-P26) from ~107 baseline; Period 25 represents the current peak at 375 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 308 units over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). Demand remains volatile, ranging from 203 to 375 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory replenishment. To capture the current regime's characteristics while accounting for recent high-demand peaks (like 375 in P25 and 298 in P27), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12), which covers the entire high-demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that reflects the increased mean and variance of the current state. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) continues through Period 27: average demand is approximately 308 units (P16-P27) compared to the 107 baseline; volatility remains high with a recent range of 203-375 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The initial baseline (P1-P15) was around 107 units, whereas the new regime (P16-P28, 13 periods) shows an average demand of approximately 294 units. Recent volatility is high, with demand ranging between 203 and 375 units in the last few periods. Period 28 saw a stockout with demand reaching 330 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire history. To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13) to align precisely with the start of the current regime. Setting L to 0 explicitly as confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P16 is sustained for 13 periods with an average demand of ~294 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~45).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~107 units to ~294 units. In the most recent 14 periods (P16-P29), demand has remained high with substantial volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of observations. Based on the game history, the critical fractile for the OR backend is q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, meaning we should target a 80% service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine bases its base stock calculation on the increased mean and variance observed since Period 16. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a ~107 average to a significantly higher level. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 287 units. While there is high volatility (range 203\u2013375), the recent demand in Period 30 (261) and Period 29 (257) suggests the high plateau is sustained but stabilizing. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 30. Given the high-demand regime has lasted 15 periods, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this specific regime, which better informs the OR backend's base-stock calculation than the long-term average. This approach balances the need to cover frequent spikes (up to 375 units) while managing inventory during lower demand periods within the regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) has sustained for 15 periods (P16-P30) with an average demand of ~287 units and high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-regime state since Period 16. In the most recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the average demand is approximately 289 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 43 units. The last period (P31) saw a demand of 316, which is aligned with this regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given current on-hand inventory is only 9 units and the high target service level (implied by Profit $4.0 vs Holding Cost $1.0), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 16 periods (N=16) to capture the current regime's dynamics while filtering out the lower demand from P1-P15. Lead time L is set to calculate to leverage the known 0-period history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1304.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~107 to a high-demand regime. Analyzing the window from P16 to P32 (17 periods), the average demand is 292.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 47 units. The most recent demand (P32) reached a new peak of 388 units, which led to a stockout. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will maintain. To prevent stockouts in this high-volatility, high-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17) to capture the current regime's statistics while giving sufficient weight to the most recent elevated demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak observed: Period 32 demand reached 388 units, the highest in the current high-demand regime (P16-P32 avg: 292.4).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that started at Period 16 continues to be sustained. Analysis of the demand from Period 16 to Period 33 shows an average demand of approximately 292.8 units with a standard deviation of roughly 48.7. Period 32 saw a peak demand of 388 units. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To capture this sustained regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=18 (covering Periods 16-33) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the current regime's statistics rather than the much lower historical baseline. On-hand inventory is currently low (35 units), so an order is necessary to maintain service levels in this high-volatility environment.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~107 to an average of ~293. Demand remains highly volatile, with a recent peak of 388 (P32). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To manage this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I am using a recent window of 19 periods (P16-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the entirety of the current regime starting from the changepoint at P16. Setting L to 0 explicitly to match the observed history and the backend's base-stock calculation logic.

The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is sustained and stable. For the current period (P36), the available history shows that demand has been consistently higher and more volatile since Period 16 compared to the initial baseline. The average demand for this regime (P16-P35) is approximately 293 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this regime accurately while allowing for the observed volatility (which occasionally peaks near 380-390 units), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20, which covers the entire high-demand regime. This provides the OR backend with the correct statistical context to maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs, especially given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors slightly higher stock levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 21 periods (P16-P36), the mean demand is approximately 293 units with a standard deviation of about 45. Period 36 specifically saw a demand of 345, resulting in a stockout. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime while allowing for recent volatility (including the peak in P32), I will use the last 20 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This provides a balance between responsiveness and statistical stability, ensuring the base stock level covers the high service level requirements (Profit/Cost ratio of 4:1 implies an ~80% target quantile, which the backend's capped policy manages).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-37), the average demand is approximately 293 units with a standard deviation of about 45. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). In Period 37, demand was 262 units, and we enter Period 38 with 75 units on-hand. Given the high volatility (recent peak of 388 in P32) and a high service level requirement (profit is $4 vs holding cost $1), I will use the recent N (N=20) periods to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 290+ average and the significant volatility observed since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) is sustained through Period 37 (22 periods) with an average of ~293 units and a standard deviation of ~45. Lead time remains 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 38 (23 periods), the mean is approximately 290 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45. Period 38 demand (230) was slightly lower than recent averages, but within the expected variance. I am setting L to 0 based on consistent historical evidence from 'Period X conclude' messages. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=23 to focus on this current high-demand regime, capturing the sustained average and volatility level while ignoring the pre-Period 16 baseline. This ensures we maintain a base stock level appropriate for the 290-unit mean and ~45-unit sigma context.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-39), the average demand is approximately 291 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. For Period 40, I will use a base stock policy using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards) to provide the OR engine with the most accurate mean and volatility estimates for this specific regime. This ensures the target stock level is sufficient to meet the expected 291 units while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility, considering we currently have 66 units on hand and a 0-period lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is still active, spanning 25 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 345, 262, 230, 265, 228) shows a slight cooling compared to the mid-regime highs, but remains well above the initial 107 units baseline. The average demand of this 25-period regime is approximately 291 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of this regime while smoothing out the high volatility observed (e.g., Period 32 demand was 388). L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time is stable and confirmed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 262, 230, 265, 228, 328) averages ~263 units, which is slightly lower than the initial regime average (~293) but significantly higher than the baseline (~107). Period 41 ended with 0 inventory, indicating that the order was fully used to satisfy demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (the order arrived in the same period it was placed), which allows for responsive inventory management. To optimize for the current regime and high volatility (range 228-328 recently), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this high-demand period while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 291 units. Recent trends from Period 38 to 42 (230, 265, 228, 328, 280) show a mean of 266.2, which is slightly lower than the overall regime average but reflects recent volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units. With transition to same-period arrival (L=0) consistently observed since the start, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand of Period 43. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the characteristics of the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent variability. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) implies a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)), which is handled by the OR backend. Using recent_N for both mean and sigma ensures we are adapting to the post-Period 16 environment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16 to P43), the average demand is approximately 291.6 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 41.5. In the last 5 periods (P39-P43), the average is slightly lower at 281 units, but the overall volatility remains consistent. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. To maximize reward, I will set L to 0 (explicitly, as it is confirmed and stable). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the characteristics of the high-demand regime while filtering out the initial transition noise, ensuring the base stock level (\u03bc + z\u03c3) is sufficient to cover the current demand distribution (~292 units plus safety stock) and minimize stockouts which have occurred recently (P41).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 292 units per period. The most recent demand (P44) was 286 units, following a fairly consistent pattern of 280-304 units in the last few periods. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the stability of this high-demand regime, I will use a recent window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat), as this encompasses the sustained trend and its characteristic volatility while filtering out the initial low-demand baseline. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate given the 100% historical accuracy of the 0-period lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 30 periods (P16-P45), the average demand is approximately 289 units with a standard deviation of 43.6. Reviewing the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), the average is 280 units and the standard deviation is 35.8, indicating slightly lower but more stable demand recently. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history (P1 to P45). With the game ending at Period 50, I will focus on the most recent regime to set parameters. I am using recent_N=30 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current regime's volatility and mean, which ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover demand while accounting for the high volatility observed in this segment.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 31 periods (P16-P46), the mean demand is approximately 289 units with a standard deviation of about 42 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To optimize for the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 0.8 service level) while accounting for the high volatility observed (peaks up to 388), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most representative recent performance of this regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a sufficient safety buffer to minimize stockouts, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained stable but volatile ever since. For the high-demand regime (P16 to P47, N=32), the mean demand is approximately 287 units with a standard deviation of approximately 44 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 48 is approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50), the primary objective is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. Setting L to 0 via 'calculate' reflects the true lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using 'recent_N' with N=32 to capture the full statistics of the current high-demand regime, providing the OR engine with the most accurate mean and variance for the base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $815.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains stable through Period 48. Current data from this regime (P16-P48, 33 periods) shows an average demand of approximately 287.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 42.6. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For the final period decision (P49), I will use the established regime statistics. Specifically, I am using N=33 for 'recent_N' to capture the full stabilization of this high-demand period, providing a robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The ending inventory of 97 units is relatively low compared to the average demand, so a standard order based on these parameters will ensure adequate service levels for the final phase of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1081.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 49, the average demand is approximately 287 units with a standard deviation of about 42 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (the order placed in a period arrives and is available for sale in that same period). For Period 50, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this sustained regime while remaining responsive to any subtle recent shifts. Setting L to 0 (explicit) ensures the OR backend understands the immediate availability of stock. This approach balances the high service level required for the $4.0 profit margin against the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (started P16) has sustained through P49 (34 periods) with an average demand of ~287 units and standard deviation of ~42. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.
