Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) shows a mean of 97.2 and a standard deviation of 16.7. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (q = 0.8). Initial inventory is 0, so an immediate order is required to meet current and future demand. We will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available historical samples for the initial base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the demand (156) exceeded the order placed (112), resulting in a stockout (sold 112, on-hand 0). The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods. Historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) have a mean of 97.2, but the actual demand in Period 1 was 156, suggesting a significant level shift or high volatility not captured in the initial samples. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh recent observations more heavily, while using the 'calculate' method for lead time as the promised lead time of 0 was successfully met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 22 units. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, with orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 arriving within the same period. Demand was 156 in P1 and 117 in P2 (total average ~136.5). The provided historical samples (Period 1-5) show demand of 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, which suggests a slightly lower mean (~97.2) than what was observed in the game execution logs so far. However, since the goal is to maximize reward and the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I will use the most recent 2 observed data points from the conclude messages combined with the provided sample for Period 3 (74) to adjust for what appears to be a slight downward trend in demand. I will set L to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior (117 from P2, 74 from P3 sample, and 156 from P1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable in Period N). The demand observed so far (156, 117, 90) shows a downward trend compared to the initial sample data provided (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). However, given only 3 periods of game history, I will use a balanced approach. The mean of the 8 total demand points available (5 samples + 3 game history) is 99.125. Since L=0, the review period is 1+0=1. mu_hat should target this demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent game-specific demand levels (avg 121), which are slightly higher than the pre-game samples. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The history shows a promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistent throughout the first four periods (orders arrive same-period). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a downward trend: 156, 117, 90, 77 (averaging 110 over all 4 periods, but clearly declining). For Period 5, I will weight recent demand more heavily to avoid overstocking while the trend settles. I'll use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~95). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods is [110, 116, 74, 101, 85], though the actual observed sales/demand recorded in the 'conclude' messages differs slightly: [156, 117, 90, 77, 94]. The average demand from the conclude messages is approximately 107. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with the history, all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0). Inventory currently stands at 18 units with 0 in-transit. Since the lead time is consistently 0, L is set to 'calculate'. For demand (mu_hat), the demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level compared to the initial spike in Period 1 (156). I will use the last 5 periods to capture this trend. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 7. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-6), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows: P1:156 (partially lost as sold was 112), P2:117, P3:90, P4:77, P5:94, P6:106. The initial high demand in P1 (156) seems to have stabilized into a regime between 77 and 117. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is (117+90+77+94+106)/5 = 96.8. Given the slight upward trend in the last three periods (77 -> 94 -> 106), I will use N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this more recent, stable regime compared to the P1 outlier. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand for chips(Regular) has fluctuated, with the most recent demand (Period 7) being 125, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The profit per unit is $4.0 and the holding cost is $1.0, which leads to a critical ratio of 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84). The demand appears quite volatile, ranging from 77 to 156. Specifically, looking at the delivery history, shipments have consistently arrived in the same period they were ordered. Given that there is currently 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, we need to place an order that covers the immediate demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for mean and N=7 for sigma to capture the full recent history since the start, which includes various demand shifts (high initial demand, a dip, and a recent uptick). This balances the need for responsiveness with the available sample size.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, with values ranging from 64 to 156. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently been met in all 8 concluded periods (confirmed by 'lead_time was 0 periods' in each conclusion message). Demand in the last three periods (P6: 106, P7: 125, P8: 64) averages 98.3, compared to the overall average of 103.6. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, but the variability is high. To maintain high service levels while managing holding costs, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and standard deviation, which balances the recent high demand in P7 with the low demand in P8. L remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-9 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed or delayed shipments. Analyzing the historical demand (P1-P9): 156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64, 87. The mean demand is approximately 101.8. There is no clear trending or seasonal pattern visible in the provided indices, though demand fluctuates between 64 and 156. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the full range of recent behavior for both mean and standard deviation. Since L=0, the OR backend targets (1+0) = 1 period of coverage (current period demand). The on-hand inventory is 27, and the pipeline is 0. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods will balance the risk of stockouts during the current period against the costs of holding 'chips(Regular)' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently low at 3 units. Based on the historical demand data, we have two sets of figures. The pre-game samples (Period 1-5) show an average demand of 97.2. The game history (Period 1-10) shows an average demand of 103.9. Analyzing the full 15-period sequence (P1-5 samples + P1-10 history), the mean is 99.4 with a standard deviation of 22.8. No significant regime shift is detected as demand oscillates between ~60 and ~150 without a sustained trend or structural change. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed game periods. Therefore, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to prioritize the actual game behavior while capturing the variance seen in play. Lead time L will remain as 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $498.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1 through 11 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low at 2 units. Demand has shown some volatility recently (ranging from 64 to 125 in the last 5 periods); I will use the last 5 periods to estimate mean demand (average ~97) and standard deviation to capture this recent variance. This 'recent_N' approach (N=5) allows the OR backend to react to the most current demand patterns while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations without a clear seasonal or structural shift. Over the last 12 periods, demand has averaged approximately 103.67 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) averaged 95.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Given the relatively high profit margin compared to holding cost (4:1), I want to maintain a service level that prevents the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 1 and 7. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent demand volatility while acknowledging the 0-period lead time environment (Review + Lead Time = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. However, at the start of Period 14, we are at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 13 where demand (134) exceeded starting inventory (119). Historical demand averages approximately 106 units per period, but has peaked as high as 156. Since the profit margin is high ($4) compared to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) will be 0.80. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the mean demand of the entire active game history, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. This should ensure the base stock levels are high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for lead time being 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history for the last 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 105.7 units. The most recent demand (Period 14) was 96 units, and the previous period had a stockout with demand reaching at least 134 units. The distribution appears relatively stable without clear regime shifts or seasonal signals in the provided data. With on-hand inventory at 33 units and zero in-transit, we need to order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 15) and buffer against variance. Given the Profit of $4 and Holding Cost of $1, our target service level q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), implying a base stock choice that covers 80% of demand outcomes. I will use the recent 14 samples to capture the current demand distribution accurately while ignoring the initial pre-game samples to stay tuned to the active game dynamics.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 15 completed periods. The average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 103.3. However, demand shows significant volatility (std dev ~26). Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, implying a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). The starting inventory is 57. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as history confirms it is 0. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the full mean of the current observable regime (avg ~103.3). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to account for the actual variance observed in this period, ensuring the backend OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer for the 80% service level.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) fluctuates but remains relatively stable around a mean. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has a mean of 93.6 units/period (80, 134, 96, 70, 88). Demand samples provided prior to the game (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) also average around 97. Given the 0-period lead time, the inventory review + lead period consists of only the current period (L+1 = 1). We will use a recent N=10 approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out localized noise. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the standard deviation (sigma_hat) to protect against stockouts (critical for high-profit items like chips), while the OR backend's capped policy prevents excessive overstocking.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with some fluctuations. I've analyzed the historical demand from Period 1 to Period 17, noting that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (N=10) is approximately 100.3 units, compared to the overall average of 103 units, suggesting a slight recent decrease, although not a major shift. The standard deviation across all periods is approximately 25. Given the current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) and the promised lead time is 0, I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture recent demand trends, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a stable safety stock buffer. L is set to 'default' since lead time reliability has been 100%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift, with Period 18 showing a peak of 152 and Period 17 at 116. The average demand across all periods is approximately 104, but the average of the last 3 periods is 118, indicating a potential regime change or high-variance cluster. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 18 observed periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 0 units in transit, meaning we must order enough to cover the forecasted demand for Period 19 immediately. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand variability while smoothing noise, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes. Setting L to default (0) as the lead time has been perfectly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand surged to 238, which is significantly higher than the historical average (approx. 100-110). This follows a high demand of 152 in Period 18. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a significant peak that needs to be addressed to avoid stockouts, as evidenced by the sold units being capped by on-hand inventory in both P18 and P19. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain using 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase observed starting Period 18: mean jumped from ~100 to over 190 in the last two periods (+90% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows highly volatile behavior. While Period 18 and 19 showed a significant spike (demands of 152 and 238), Period 20 saw a sharp drop to 94. This indicates the previously noted 'demand regime shift' may have been a short-term volatility spike rather than a sustained plateau at the +90% level. The current on-hand inventory is 128. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (averaging the spike and the recent drop) while assuming the lead time remains 0 as consistently observed. This balances the risk of another spike against the risk of overstocking following the Period 20 dip. Since profit ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a higher service level (~80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 18; the 'regime shift' at P18/P19 was followed by a sharp drop in P20 (94), indicating inconsistent demand spikes rather than a stable new level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a highly volatile period starting around Period 18. We saw individual demand peaks of 152 and 238 (Periods 18 and 19), followed by a drop to 94 (Period 20) and a bounce back to 136 (Period 21). The average demand of the last 4 periods (18-21) is 155. This is significantly higher than the long-term average (periods 1-17, mean ~103). Given the profit/holding ratio ($4/$1), the system targets an 80% service level. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the observed lead time is consistently 0. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new, more volatile, and higher-mean regime. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significantly increased standard deviation seen in these recent spikes and drops.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift in volatility and mean since Period 18. Specifically, demand values (152, 238, 94, 136, 179) indicate a much higher average (~160) and standard deviation compared to the first 17 periods (average ~100). The lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 5 periods (since P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captured regime more accurately reflects the current high-volatility environment. Setting L to calculate confirms the 0-day lead time observed throughout the history. Applying the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated demand and the increased risk of stockouts seen in P18 and P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P18-P23) shows a significant shift in behavior compared to the first 17 periods. While the previous average was ~100, the last 6 periods have a mean of approximately 155 with much higher volatility (spikes of 152, 238, 179 and drops to 94, 132). This confirms the 'regime shift' toward higher but less predictable demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this higher variance and mean while avoiding excessive stockouts (as seen in P18-P19), I will use a recent_N window of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current volatile regime without being overly influenced by the previous lower-demand period. Profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies a service level of 80%, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 18: Mean demand has increased from ~100 to ~155 (+55%) with significantly higher volatility, necessitating a shorter window for parameter calculation to remain responsive.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a clear regime shift around Period 18. Before P18, mean demand was roughly 100. Since P18, demand samples have been: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131. The average of these last 7 periods is approximately 151.7, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a ~155 mean. Volatility is also significantly higher in this new regime (standard deviation increased). Inventory is currently at 66 units on-hand with nothing in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To stay responsive to this higher, more volatile demand while avoiding excessive holding costs (as Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1, implying a service level target around 80%), I will use a window of the last 7 periods (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 18 remains the primary focus. Since Period 18, demand has become significantly more volatile with a higher mean (avg ~155 compared to the pre-P18 avg of ~100). The most recent observations (P21-P25) show demand values of 136, 179, 132, 131, and 125, suggesting a stabilization in this higher-demand regime but with persistent variance. I will use a window of N=8 (covering P18-P25) to capture this entire high-demand/high-volatility period while excluding the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the OR backend uses a \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 that reflect the current market conditions. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18. Over the last 9 periods (P18-P26), the mean demand is approximately 147.3 units with a standard deviation of 41.5. This is significantly higher than the pre-P18 mean of ~100. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. With No In-transit units and 46 units On-hand, I need to set parameters that reflect this current regime. I will use recent_N=9 for both Mu and Sigma to capture this shift while excluding the lower-demand history. Using the last 9 periods covers the entirety of the confirmed new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P18-P26 stabilized at mean ~147, confirmed significantly higher than P1-P17 mean of ~100.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 18, with a significant increase in both mean and volatility. From P1-P17, the mean demand was ~103. From P18-P27, the mean demand rose to ~149.4. Last period's demand (P27) was 169, confirming the higher demand level persists. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). To capture this new regime while ignoring the lower historical mean of the first 17 periods, I am setting the review window (N) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to the last 10 periods (P18-P27). This ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock based on the current higher-demand environment, maintaining an appropriate service level for the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 18 to Period 28 is approximately 145.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 41.5 units, compared to the initial mean of ~102. Recent demand (Period 27-28) showed a spike (169) followed by a moderate level (106). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently met, I will continue to use L=0. I am choosing a window of N=11 (from Period 18 to Period 28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime and ensure the OR backend's inventory target reflects the most recent environment.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting Around Period 18. Before P18, mean demand was ~100. From P18 to P29, the mean has stabilized around 148, but with significantly higher volatility (standard deviation ~38 vs ~23 previously). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 30, I will use a window of N=12 (P18-P29) to capture this higher demand regime and its increased variance. This ensures the base stock level calculated by the OR backend reflects the current average demand (~150) and the higher safety stock required to cover the increased volatility, while remaining responsive to the most recent behavior.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 18 from an average of ~100 to a higher, more volatile state. From Period 18 to 30, the mean demand is approximately 147.1 units. In the most recent four periods (P27-P30), demand has been 169, 106, 156, and 171, averaging 150.5. Although P28 was lower, the overall trend supports maintaining the higher baseline established in the mid-game. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the new regime at P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures the increased mean and volatility while ignoring the outdated lower-demand history of P1-P17.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume, higher-variance regime that began around Period 18. Comparing the pre-shift (P1-P17) mean of ~102 to the post-shift (P18-P31) mean of ~143 confirms a sustained roughly 40% increase. Recent demand remains volatile (ranging from 106 to 171 in the last four periods). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be met consistently as observed in the 'conclude' messages, I will maintain L at default. To capture this 'new normal' while smoothing out the high period-to-period volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 14 (covering the entire current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base_stock calculation reflects the increased demand and elevated risk of stockouts during spikes without being overly reactive to single-period outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $613.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 18, increasing from an average of ~100 to a higher, more volatile level. Since Period 27, demand has stabilized at an even higher mean of approximately 148 (Periods 27-32: 169, 106, 156, 171, 131, 158). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Current on-hand inventory is low (19 units) following a demand of 158 in Period 32. To capture this stabilized higher demand and the associated increase in volatility while remaining responsive to potential further shifts, I will use a recent window of N=6 (Periods 27-32). This window specifically targets the most recent stable regime to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the current demand pattern without over-ordering based on the extreme outlier in Period 19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P27-P32 further stabilized at a higher mean of ~148 compared to the P18-P26 mean of ~147, maintaining higher volatility than the pre-P18 period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18, with a secondary stabilization noted around Period 27. The mean demand for the most recent period (P27-P33) is approximately 147 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. To optimize for the current regime and its associated volatility, I'm using a window of N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the localized stable period since Period 27. This ensures the base stock reflects recent demand levels (around 147 units) plus a safety buffer for the observed high variance while ignoring the lower-demand data from the first 17 periods. Inventory levels are currently low (33 on-hand), so the OR engine will trigger a significant order to reach the calculated base stock.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18, with the most recent sub-regime (starting Period 27) showing a mean demand of approximately 148.5 units and significant volatility. Current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), and since the lead time is 0, the order placed this period arrives effectively immediately to meet Period 35 demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8, covering the stable period from P27 to P34. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand level and the observed volatility, maintaining a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical value q = 0.8). Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed in history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a higher-level stable regime since Period 18, with a slight further increase/stabilization noted from Period 27 onwards. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P27-P35) is approximately 147.56 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). Given the stable mean and volatility in this recent regime, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this specific behavior without being influenced by the significantly lower demand periods 1-17. This approach ensures we maintain enough safety stock to cover the observed demand spikes (e.g., 171 in P30) while minimizing excess holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) hasn't shown a significant new shift since the stabilization observed around Period 27/33. Recent demand (P33-P36: 137, 162, 132, 121) yields a mean of 138, slightly lower than the P27-P32 mean of 148, but consistent within the high-volatility regime identified earlier. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain responsiveness to this high-volatility regime while accounting for the most recent data, I am using a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will use N=10 to capture the behavior since Period 27, ensuring the model reacts to the sustained higher demand compared to the pre-P18 baseline while smoothing out the periodic fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $617.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 27 to Period 37 is approximately 146.1 units. The most recent demand (Period 37) was 156, and inventory is currently low (7 units on-hand), following a period where sales were high. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this stable but higher-volume regime, I am using a recent window (N=11, covering Period 27-37) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand average and volatility while ignoring the significantly lower demand from the first 17 periods. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-demand periods without overstocking based on the older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P27-P37 remains stable with a mean of ~146 and consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~146 since Period 27, though volatility remains relatively high. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. For Period 39, I am focusing on the most recent demand regime (P27-P38) to set parameters. N=12 is selected for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable period while excluding the initial shift transition. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains a buffer for the observed volatility, considering the $4 profit and $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained higher level since Period 18, with the most recent stabilization occurring from Period 27 onwards. Period 39 experienced a high demand of 185, which resulted in a stockout (sold 163, ending inventory 0). The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 39 is approximately 148.3. I will use a recent_N window of 13 periods (from P27 to P39) to capture this stable high-demand regime while accounting for the recent spike. This N=13 window provides a balanced estimate of the current mean and volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 13 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the higher volume and increased variability seen in this regime, aimed at preventing further stockouts like the one in Period 39.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained relatively stable since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 146-148 units. Recent performance (Periods 39 and 40) showed demand of 185 and 154, respectively, confirming that demand remains significantly higher than the initial periods. Lead time across the entire history has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a window of recent_N = 14 to capture the demand behavior since Period 27, which reflects the current stable but high-demand state. This window length (N=14) balances responsiveness to recent spikes (like Period 39) with the stability observed over the last 13-14 periods. The the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally handle the service level target given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, higher-volume regime since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 146 units per period. The most recent demand samples are Period 39 (185), Period 40 (154), and Period 41 (119), which continue to reflect this average with inherent volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 42, I am using a recent window (N=15, covering P27-P41) to capture the current regime's mean and variance while filtering out the noisier transition period (P18-P26). This approach balances the need for stability against the recent observed volatility to ensure the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302) sufficiently covers demand within the same period (L=0).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-mean, high-volatility state that began around Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand since Period 27 has been approximately 149 units. Period 42 showed a jump to 190, which, while high, is consistent with the volatility observed in this regime (e.g., Period 19 was 238, Period 39 was 185). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we must order enough to cover the entirety of Period 43's demand. I will use N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 27-42) to capture the stable properties of the current regime while filtering out the lower-demand data from the first half of the game. This should provide a robust base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 147-148 units and moderate volatility. Recent periods (P39-P43) have shown sessions of high demand (185, 190) followed by moderate demand (116, 119), suggesting sustained high-variability demand. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), ensuring a high service level is critical to avoid stockouts like those seen in P39 and P42. I will use the last 17 periods (starting from P27) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a higher regime since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 144 units over the last 27 periods (P18-P44). Recent demand shows continued volatility (P41: 119, P42: 190, P43: 116, P44: 124). The inventory level is currently at 45 units with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0), I will continue to use L=0. To capture the current demand regime which stabilized around P27, I will use recent_N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (covering Period 27 to Period 44). This window is sufficient to account for the sustained higher volume and volatility observed in the latter half of the game. The parameters are designed to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 27 with a mean of approximately 148, but recent periods (P39-P45) show continued high volatility with several instances of stockouts (P39, P42, P45) when demand spikes between 170-190. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, making this a critical restock period. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as indicated by the 'arrived... (lead_time was 0 periods)' confirmation in every conclude message. To ensure enough stock to cover these frequent spikes while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N window of 19 (covering Period 27 to 45) to capture the stabilized mean of the current higher-demand regime while accounting for the increased variance seen in recent weeks. This balances the service level to avoid the repeated lost sales seen when demand exceeds 170.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 148 units, but it remains volatile with recent peaks hitting 190. In the most recent periods (P45-P46), demand (170, 172) has exceeded stock, leading to stockouts. Specifically, Period 46 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, as the order from that period arrived and was immediately sold to meet demand. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4.0/unit vs $1.0 holding cost, service level ~80%), I will use a shorter lookback (recent_N=10) to better capture the recent high-demand volatility while smoothing out extreme outliers like the P42 spike. Setting L=0 for the calculation as all historically concluded orders arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P39-P46 shows increased volatility compared to the previous stable regime, with demand frequently exceeding 160 and causing consecutive stockouts (P45, P46). Mean demand looks closer to 155 in this 8-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $619.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and sustained high levels in the most recent 9-period regime (P39-P47). Specifically, demand has exceeded 160 units in 4 out of the last 9 periods (P39, P42, P45, P46), leading to multiple stockouts. The mean demand for this window (P39-P47) is approximately 154.3, compared to the previously observed 146. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the service level targeted by the OR engine is naturally high (80th percentile). However, due to the recent frequency of stockouts and the trend of demand spikes above 170 units, I will shift to using a slightly shorter lookback window (N=9) for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this higher volatility and ensure the base stock level is sufficiently reactive to the current upward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0, which allows for same-period replenishment; thus L is kept at 0 to reflect the actual observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean demand increased from ~146 to ~154 with high volatility, characterized by frequent spikes above 170 and high stockout risk.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 39, characterized by a higher mean (~157) and significant volatility, with demand frequently exceeding 170. This shift followed a relatively stable period (P27-P38). The current observation shows we are at Period 49. In Period 48, demand was 142, and ending on-hand inventory is 37. Given the 'chips' category and the pattern of sudden spikes (e.g., P39, P42, P45, P46), I will use a shorter window (recent_N=10) to capture this most recent high-volatility regime (P39-P48). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend adjusts for the increased mean of ~157 and the higher standard deviation observed in the last 10 periods, helping to mitigate the stockout risks seen in periods 39, 42, 45, and 46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $654.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime that started around Period 39. In the last 11 periods (P39-P49), the mean demand is approximately 154.27 units, with frequent spikes reaching up to 190. Recent demand (P49) was 166. On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units). Given the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 11 periods to capture this specific regime (N=11). Since the volatility is high and stockouts have occurred (P39, P42, P45, P46), I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.
