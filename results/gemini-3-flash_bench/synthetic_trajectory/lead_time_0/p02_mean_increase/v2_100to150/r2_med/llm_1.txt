The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has stable demand with spikes during weekends or sporting events, though no specific dates are provided. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows values [110, 116, 74, 101, 85], averaging approximately 97 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the same period to meet Period 1 demand. To maximize profit and account for demand variability (maximum seen is 116), I will target an order that covers the current period's demand plus a small buffer.
