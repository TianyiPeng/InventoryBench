From Period 19 to Period 33, the average demand has risen to approximately 144 units, with a notable increase in volatility.

A base stock level for 1 period of demand (since L=0, we need to cover L+1=1 period) at a target of ~145 units would require an order that, when added to current stock (54), reaches that target. 145 - 54 = 91 units. Following the OR cap suggests it's trying to limit holding costs given the $1/unit cost, but several recent periods (P37, P39, P42) resulted in stockouts because supply didn't meet demand peaks. 5.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Orders placed in Period N arrive during Period N. Inventory Analysis: Starting on-hand inventory for Period 49 is 23 units. There are 0 units in-transit. Demand Analysis: Since the shift at Period 19, the mean demand has increased significantly. Calculating the mean from Period 19 to Period 48, the average demand is approximately 148 units (Total 4434 / 30 periods). The OR recommendation of 106 is based on the entire history (Periods 1-48), which includes the lower demand period (P1-P18 avg ~104) and is therefore under-forecasting current needs. Strategy: Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50). My goal is to maximize Period 49 profit while ensuring enough stock for the final period (Period 50) without excessive holding costs. To cover Period 49 demand (estimated at ~150) and leave enough for Period 50, I need a 'base stock' level. Using the recent mean of 148, the target inventory is roughly 150-160 units. With 23 on-hand, an order of 140 units brings total availability to 163, which should satisfy demand and minimize the risk of a stockout while keeping holding costs manageable for the final transition.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data from Period 1 to 49 consistently shows that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0), matching the promised lead time. Inventory analysis: Ending on-hand inventory for Period 49 was 0, and there are no units in-transit. Demand analysis: The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting Period 19) remains stable. Recent demand (P40-P49) has averaged approximately 156 units, with a high of 190. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 130 is too low as it likely incorporates early-game low demand (avg ~104) into its mean calculation. To satisfy the current demand regime (~156 units) and avoid stockouts (as seen in P49), I will order 160 units. This covers the\u8fd1\u671f average plus a small buffer, which is appropriate given the 1-to-1 ratio of profit to holding cost.",
