However, given that the recent 3-period demand average is 155 and the 12-period average (post-regime shift) is 172, the OR recommendation of 136 is likely too low and biased by older, lower demand periods (Periods 7-15). \n4.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time Analysis: Historical data confirms a lead time (L) of 0 periods, with orders arriving and being available for sale in the same period they are placed. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged 165 units (185, 135, 181, 137, 189), though it frequently spikes toward 190-200. On-hand inventory is currently 11 units. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 161 units is based on capped logic using a longer historical window. Given that this is the final period (Period 50), I want to ensure I capture all possible demand without worrying about excessive holding costs for the next period. I will target a stock level of approximately 200 units (the upper end of the current demand regime) to maximize potential profit. Since on-hand is 11, an order of 189 units brings total available stock to 200.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation to 189 units to target a maximum potential demand of 200 in this final period, given recent spikes and current 0-day lead time.",
