Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead-time data or arrivals yet. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) provide an initial distribution: mean = 101.8, std \u2248 30.5. Since on-hand inventory starts at 0 and lead time is 0, the order must cover current period demand immediately. I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (N=5). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a critical fractal (q) of 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target an 80% service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units which arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0), matching the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 91 units, leaving 35 units on hand. The historical demand data provided for Period 1-5 suggests a mean demand of approximately 101.8 units ((141+118+67+94+89)/5). However, the specific observation for Period 1 was 91. Since we have very little history (only 1 period concluded) and a set of 5 sample points, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirmed an actual lead time of 0, so 'default' for L is appropriate. This will set the base stock to cover demand for Period 2 (L+1 = 1) while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (same-day arrival). The product 'chips(Regular)' has shown highly volatile demand (P1: 91, P2: 130), contrasting with the pre-game samples (avg ~102). In Period 2, we stocked out because the base stock calculation (which used the pre-game mean) didn't account for the demand spike to 130. I am switching to 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=2 to capture the higher realized demand levels while keeping L=0. Since 130 and 91 average to 110.5, and we expect high volatility for snack items, I will use recent samples to better inform the OR engine's service level calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $447.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). Demand for the first three periods was 91, 130, and 114 (Mean = 111.6, Std Dev = 19.7). In Period 2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, demand 130 > starting inventory 122). Current on-hand is 9. Since L=0 and demand occurs after the order, we must cover Period 4's demand. I will use the average demand of the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock to cover the expected demand (111.6) plus a safety buffer based on the variance and the critical ratio (Profit=4, Holding=1; q = 4/5 = 0.8), minus the 9 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1-P3). Stockout occurred in P2 due to demand spike (130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility with a significant spike in Period 2 (130) and sustained demand around 114-118 in Periods 3 and 4. The historical data provided in the prompt (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) seems to conflict with the actual observed game history (91, 130, 114, 118), suggesting a potential upward regime shift or high variance. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use the last 4 periods of game history to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the most current demand profile (mean ~113, std ~16). This ensures the base stock calculation, which targets a roughly 80% service level based on the profit/holding ratio (4/(4+1)), accounts for the recent activity without overreacting to the P2 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent pattern around a mean of ~112 units since Period 2. The initial demand samples provided (Period 1-5 mean: 101.8) included lower noise (67, 94, 89), while actual game history (Period 1-5 mean: 111.8) shows slightly higher consumption. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all completed cycles. Since L=0, the target base stock (mu_hat) needs to cover current period demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~117 in the last 4 periods) while maintaining enough buffer via sigma_hat to avoid the stockout experienced in Period 2. The OR engine will target the 80th percentile service level (4/5) based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 7, we analyze the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand sequence (including pre-game samples) is [141, 118, 67, 94, 89, 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46]. The most recent observation (Period 6) shows a significant drop to 46 units, compared to the previous 5 periods which hovered between 91 and 130. While Period 6 might be an outlier, we use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averaging 114, 118, 106, and 46, plus Period 2's high demand) to capture the recent volatility without overreacting solely to one low data point. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 84, and since profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1), the backend will aim for a high service level. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures we account for the increased variance seen in the recent drop.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed from Period 1 through Period 7. Demand has shown some volatility; while the first 5 periods averaged ~112 units, Period 6 saw a significant drop to 46 before rebounding to 86 in Period 7. Given this variance and the recent dip, I will use a N=5 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent mean of ~94 units while acknowledging the volatile history. The sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the heightened standard deviation observed during this period of high and low demand cycles. Base stock logic will aim for a service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)), protecting against stockouts while maintaining manageable holding costs given the zero lead time allows for responsive replenishments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variance over the first 8 periods, ranging from a low of 46 (Period 6) to a high of 130 (Period 2). The average demand across all periods is approximately 99.25 units. There was a significant drop in Period 6 (46), but demand rebounded to 86 and 103 in Periods 7 and 8, suggesting the low in Period 6 was likely an outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 8. Given the current on-hand inventory of 16, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the overall average demand while weighting the recent recovery. I will use 'default' for L (0) and sigma_hat to maintain a standard service level buffer, as the current profit margin (4:1) justifies holding some safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history (P1-P9) shows that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand has been fluctuating with an average around 100 units per period. Specifically, Period 6 saw a significant drop (46), but demand recovered to near-mean levels (86, 103, 98) in Periods 7-9. Given the consistency of lead time and the relatively stable but volatile demand, a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is appropriate to capture the current demand regime which averages approximately 87.8 units with a standard deviation reflecting recent variability. This N=5 captures the recovery phase following the P6 outlier while still including it to maintain a safe buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, a stockout occurred as demand (137) exceeded available inventory (109), resulting in 0 ending on-hand inventory. Analysis of the demand history shows a mean of approximately 102.9 units per period with a standard deviation of 27.5. The recent demand (Period 10: 137) suggests high volatility. Current lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent future stockouts while demand variability is high, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the full history of the current regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the observed spikes (like the 130 in P2 and 137 in P10) relative to the $4 profit and $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Recurring spikes (P2: 130, P10: 137) against a mean of ~103 cause stockouts when inventory is thin. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 39 units. History shows a lead time of 0 periods remains consistent. Demand shows a mean of approximately 101.36 units over the past 11 periods, but with significant volatility and spikes (e.g., P2: 130, P10: 137) that triggered stockouts. Setting the OR parameters to capture this recent behavior is crucial. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to encompass the full observed range and capture the variance from the high-demand spikes. Since lead time is stable at 0, I will use 'default' for L. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) suggests a high service level (~0.80), and providing the backend with the full sample variance (N=11) will help generate a base stock high enough to buffer against those recurring demand spikes of 130+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 87, bringing the ending on-hand inventory to 36. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 0 periods based on all history. Demand analysis: The historical mean is approximately 100 units, but we observe high variability with spikes around 130-140 (P2: 130, P10: 137) and drops as low as 46 (P6). Stockouts occurred in P2 and P10 when starting inventory was insufficient to cover these spikes. To maximize reward while accounting for the profit/holding ratio (4:1, implying a target service level q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat to capture the recent demand average and sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. Using N=12 for demand allows the OR backend to incorporate the full recent history including both peaks and troughs to better prepare for the 130+ spikes while L=0 ensures we don't over-order into excess inventory.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P11-P13) has been 86, 87, and 118, averaging 97 units. However, history (P2, P10) shows sharp spikes up to 137 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Since the lead time is confirmed as 0, the order placed will arrive in the same period to meet demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84). To prevent another stockout given the low starting inventory and observed volatility (std dev of all samples is approx 24.3, mean is 102), I am using 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full range of historical variability while acknowledging the stable lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the recurrent spikes.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 102.6 units based on all 14 periods of history. Although there have been periodic spikes (P2: 130, P10: 137), there is no sustained regime shift in the last 4 periods (P11-P14 avg: 100.5). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which calculates based on the full sample set. This leverages the long history to set a base stock level that accounts for the observed volatility. The current on-hand inventory is low (11), so the OR backend will naturally trigger an order to reach the target base stock level. I am using default for L as it matches the observed actual lead time of 0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility with a historical mean around 101 units but frequent spikes (130, 137, 118). With a lead time consistently at 0, the current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Using a 0-period lead time means we must cover only the current period's demand (L+1=1). Given the profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the full volatility exhibited in the game history while moving away from the seed data. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed in Periods 2 and 10 to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, a massive demand spike occurred (273 units), which is significantly higher than previous spikes (~137). This caused a total stockout. The average demand across all historical samples (Period 1 to 16 plus the seed data) is approximately 111.9, but the recent variability is extreme. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this sudden regime shift, I will use an explicit forecast. A base stock level must cover the high probability of another spike. I'll estimate mu_hat at 150 (above the historical mean of 111.9 to recover from the stockout and buffer against the P16 trend) and increase sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to handle the high variance observed (std dev of recent periods is around 53). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift at Period 16: demand spiked to 273, more than double the previous historical average (~103) and previous peak (137). Stockout occurred.

Daily Reward (R_t): $657.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant demand jump in Period 16 (273 units) and Period 17 (170 units), we have clearly entered a new high-demand regime compared to the early periods where demand averaged ~103. The lead time remains consistently at 0. Stockouts occurred in Period 16 because the OR backend's cap was still based on old statistics. By Period 17, the OR backend adjusted its base stock but the demand remains volatile (dropped from 273 to 170). For Period 18, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last two periods (273 + 170) / 2 = 221.5. Since the promised lead time L=0, the formula for mu_hat is (1+L)*forecast = 221.5. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit setting of 75 to account for the extreme volatility observed recently (the massive swing from 273 to 170).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Period 16 (273) and Period 17 (170) averages to ~221, significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of 103. Lead time remains zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $875.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. The demand values for the last three periods are 273, 170, and 232, averaging approximately 225. This is a clear departure from the previous average of around 103. Period 18 saw demand of 232, confirming the new high-demand state. lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this shift without being overly sensitive to the extreme peak in Period 16, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to cover the new regime. Similarly, I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this period (standard deviation of {273, 170, 232} is approx 51). L will be set to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the stable 0-period lead time observation. This configuration will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the elevated expected demand plus a safety margin for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained (P16-P18): Avg demand increased from ~103 to ~225 (+118%). Volatility also increased significantly during this period.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. In the new regime (P16-P19), demand has been 273, 170, 232, and 116. The average for this new regime is approximately 197.75, which is nearly double the pre-period 16 average of ~103. While Period 19 showed a dip to 116, this is still within the volatile range of the new high-demand period and we must maintain higher stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P2, P10, and P16. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the entirety of this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly increased volatility (Standard Deviation went from ~23 to ~67 in the new regime). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16-P20), the mean demand is approximately 191 ((273+170+232+116+164)/5), with a standard deviation of approximately 62. This is a clear departure from the pre-P16 average of ~103. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. For Period 21, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), a higher service level (base stock) is preferred to avoid the stockouts seen in P2, P10, and P16. The OR backend's capped policy will use these parameters to determine the order quantity needed to reach the target base stock, accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 92.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. For Periods 16-21, demand values are 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, and 180. The average demand for this new regime (N=6) is approximately 189.2, with a standard deviation of approximately 52.8. This is a significant increase from the pre-P16 average of ~103. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, allowing for same-period arrival. To maximize reward while accounting for the increased volatility (evident from the spread of 116 to 273), I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand state for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent mean of ~189 and the higher variance, protecting against stockouts while minimizing holding cost for a Lead Time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P21) average is 189.2 units per period, representing a permanent shift from the initial 103 average. Volatility has also increased (StdDev ~53).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand regime (P16 to P22), the average demand is (273 + 170 + 232 + 116 + 164 + 180 + 189) / 7 \u2248 190.5 units per period. The standard deviation during this period (N=7) is approximately 48.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a high service level (80% based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio) considering the new mean and variance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from a mean of ~103 to a significantly higher mean. Examining the recent regime (P16-P23), the demand values are: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, and 187. The average of this 8-period regime is approximately 188.8 units per period. The inventory levels and historical spikes (like P16) suggest we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the recent 8 samples to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, as they reflect the current stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock calculations (which cover L+1 = 1 period of demand) are aligned with these new levels.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean is approximately 190.4 units with a standard deviation of 44.2. Recent observations (P21-P24: 180, 189, 187, 203) show very consistent behavior near the 190 mark. The lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. To handle the increased volume and volatility of this new regime while avoiding stockouts (as seen in P16 and P2), I am using the recent_N method based on the 9 periods since the shift (Period 16 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level (~190) rather than the historical average (~103).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-24 confirmed stable: Mean ~190, StdDev ~44. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to P16, demand averaged ~103 units; since P16, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 190.4 units (P16-P25 average). Period 25 demand was 180, following a sequence of 203, 187, 189, 180, and 164, which supports the continued stability of this higher regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this current regime (P16-P25) while excluding the low-demand historical data. L will be managed by the backend using the 'calculate' method as the history consistently shows a 0-period lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift at Period 16. Analyzing the sustained regime from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the mean demand is approximately 191 units with a standard deviation of approximately 41 units. This is a substantial increase from the initial average of ~103 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 38, and a lead time of 0, I will set parameters based on the recent 11-period regime to ensure the inventory position (on-hand + arriving order) covers the higher demand level and its associated volatility. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current demand distribution accurately since the shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 27, the mean is approximately 185.2 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 41.5 (excluding the initial outlier spike of 273 slightly stabilizes the volatility profile, but we remain cautious). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the simulation. Period 27 saw a lower demand of 122, but this is within the expected range of the new regime. To capture this sustained higher demand level while being responsive to recent variance, I am using a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of the new regime (Period 16 onwards) plus recent history. This balances the need for a stable estimate against the risk of reverting to the early lower-demand data. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) demand, which is 1 period in this case since L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Since then, the demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 17 to 28, excluding the initial outlier spike in P16), the average demand is approximately 173 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 35 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded shipments. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.8, which corresponds to a z-score of 0.84. To capture the current demand and volatility accurately, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 (covering Periods 17-28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balance between responsiveness to the shift and smoothing over the recent fluctuations (like the dip in P27).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, a stockout occurred as demand (219) exceeded the starting inventory (201). The demand regime that began at Period 16 remains in effect. Looking at the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the mean demand is 185.3 with a standard deviation of approximately 42. Since the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this stable high-demand regime. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and volatility, minimizing the risk of another stockout while balancing holding costs.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. In the most recent periods (P16-P30), the mean demand is approximately 189 units with a standard deviation of approximately 41 units. A stockout occurred again in Period 29 when demand spiked to 219, and the system ended Period 30 with very low inventory (14 units). Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' (or 'recent_N') to reflect this stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 to specifically capture the statistics of this higher demand regime that began at Period 16, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the increased mean and volatility observed since that shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P29-P31: 219, 205, 227) indicates a further upward trend or high-side volatility within the existing high-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 16 periods (P16-P31) is approximately 191 units, but recent periods are consistently exceeding this average. To prevent stockouts, which occurred in P29 and P31, I will use a shorter window (N=5) to capture this recent intensity. Since the lead time is consistently 0, mu_hat and sigma_hat target a single period (1+L=1). Using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on the most relevant recent volatility and mean demand (~197 units), ensuring a higher base stock to buffer against the frequent 200+ demand spikes observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensity increased again starting Period 29: last 3 periods average ~217 compared to the previous regime average of ~190. Stockouts in P29 and P31 confirm current inventory levels are insufficient for this 200+ demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $661.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple shifts. After a regime change at Period 16 (avg ~190), a more recent intensity increase began at Period 29. Demand for Period 29-32 are 219, 205, 227, and 177 respectively, averaging ~207. Stockouts in Period 29 and 31 confirm that previous inventory levels were insufficient for this new level of demand (~200+ units). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this latest sustained increase and the high volatility (peak 273), I am using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's safety stock logic. This will ensure we order enough to cover the ~200+ unit demand expectations and potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensity increase starting Period 29 confirmed: last 4 periods average ~207 compared to previous regime of ~190. Stockouts in P29 and P31 verify that target stock levels must remain above 220 to prevent lost sales in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $574.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase since Period 29. While the average demand from Period 16-28 was approximately 190, the average demand from Period 29-33 is 197.6, with individual peaks reaching up to 227 (P31). Stockouts in P29 and P31 clearly indicate that the base stock target needs to be higher to accommodate this volatility and elevated mean. The lead time remains zero periods as confirmed by every historical arrival. Given the current on-hand inventory of 66 and the zero lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 29-33) to capture this most recent high-demand regime accurately. This N=5 choice accounts for the recent shift while mitigating the impact of the lower-demand pre-P29 period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate in a high-intensity regime that started around Period 29. The most recent demand (P34) was 219, following a lower observation of 160 (P33). Since Period 29, the average demand is approximately 204.4 units per period (219, 205, 227, 177, 160, 219) with a standard deviation of roughly 25. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a target service level of 80%. Using recent_N=6 (N=max(min(6, 20), 3)) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific high-demand phase while excluding older, lower-demand data. This strategy ensures the base stock remains high enough to mitigate the stockout risks observed in P29 and P31.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P29-P35) is approximately 189.7, but this includes significant spikes reaching up to 227 (P31) and 221 (P35). Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the order placed now will arrive this period (P36) before demand is resolved. To prevent stockouts during these high-demand periods (which have occurred in P29 and P31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent average of ~190 and the observed volatility, while the OR backend's service level logic (based on profit/holding cost) will help maintain a buffer against the recurring peaks.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P29-P36) is approximately 205.4 units, with a standard deviation of 22.8. This regime is higher than the previous P16-P28 average of ~189. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that builds towards a slightly higher service level. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this latest sustained high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The order parameter L will remain at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime (P29-P36): Mean demand has increased to ~205 units (previously ~189), with lower volatility (StdDev ~23) compared to the initial shift period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-intensity regime that began around Period 29. Analyzing the most recent data (P29-P37), the mean demand is approximately 204.7 units with a standard deviation of 23.3 units. The reported lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit and prevent stockouts (like those seen in P29 and P31), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this entire current regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a ~80% service level based on the $4 profit/$1 holding cost) is grounded in the most relevant recent volatility and volume.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 29. Analyzing the most recent data (P29-P38), the mean demand is approximately 202.5 units with a standard deviation of about 23.4. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 200+ unit average while maintaining a safety buffer for volatility, minimizing stockouts like those seen in P29 and P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16, and again around Period 29. In the most recent regime (P29-P39, 11 samples), the mean demand is approximately 204.8 units. The stockout in Period 39 (demand 228 vs starting inventory 222) underscores that the current target levels are still slightly too low for the high-end spikes of this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better capture the current demand level and volatility while maintaining a safe service level (critical since profit is 4x the holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to isolate the data from the most recent regime change at Period 29.

Carry-over insight: Stockout in Period 39 (demand=228) confirms that even within the P29-P39 regime, high-side volatility requires higher target stock levels than previously maintained (~222).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29. Analyzing the most recent data (P29-P40, N=12), the average demand is approximately 204 units with a standard deviation of about 23. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. In Period 39, we experienced a stockout because the demand (228) exceeded the total available stock (222), confirming that the target stock needs to account for upper-tail volatility. Given a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8. Since L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on this current demand regime (Periods 29-40). This ensures the mean and volatility estimates reflect the current environment rather than the significantly lower demand periods at the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a series of upward shifts, with the most recent sustained regime starting around Period 29. However, the last period (P41) showed a significant demand spike to 260, resulting in a stockout. This follows a similar spike in P39 (228). Looking at the history from P29 to P41, the mean demand is approximately 208 units, but the high-side volatility (spikes of 228 and 260) indicates that the current stocking level is insufficient to maintain the desired service level (calculated as q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8). I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent history since the P29 regime began (N=13) to capture this higher mean, and I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to 30 to better account for the observed volatility and prevent further stockouts. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased within the post-P29 regime: P41 spike (260) confirms that the target stock level must account for demand exceeding 250 to avoid frequent stockouts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts. The most recent regime began around Period 29. However, within this regime, we've observed significant spikes exceeding 220 units (P31: 227, P39: 228, P41: 260). The current lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the high-side volatility and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 31, 39, and 41, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering Periods 29-42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period includes the higher demand levels (~203 avg) and reflects the increased volatility (StdDev ~27.7). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a service level of 80%, which is appropriate for a stable SKU with intermittent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $861.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained high-regime pattern since Period 29, characterized by a mean of approximately 205 units and frequent spikes above 220 (e.g., P39: 228, P41: 260). The current on-hand inventory is very low at 11 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the goal is to set a base stock level that covers the immediate period's demand while providing a safety buffer for high-side volatility. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime (P29-P43) while excluding the lower historical data. Setting N=15 covers the entire duration of the current regime shift, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation is based on current demand intensity (~205 mean) and volatility (StdDev ~27 in this window).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 remains the current focus, with an average demand of approximately 203 units. Recent periods have shown significant volatility, specifically the spike to 260 in Period 41 and 228 in Period 39, which caused stockouts. To maximize profit and maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio ~0.8), I am setting the base stock target to account for these high-side fluctuations. I will use the recent_N method with N=16 (covering the P29 to P44 regime) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment within the period. The parameters aim to maintain on-hand inventory levels capable of absorbing demand spikes above 250 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 206 units. Recent periods (P41: 260, P45: 226) show that high-side volatility is a significant risk, leading to frequent stockouts. The inventory currently stands at only 1 unit on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maximize profit and provide a sufficient service level given the high stockout cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), the base stock level needs to account for this increased volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the regime from P29 to P45) to capture the current mean, and an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the observed peak volatility (standard deviation in this regime is approx 27, but we need to cover spikes up to 260). An explicit sigma_hat of 35 will provide a more robust safety stock to mitigate the frequent stockouts seen in P39 and P41.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 29 to a higher level (mean ~205). Recent periods (P39-P46) show continued high-side volatility with demand reaching 228, 260, 218, 226, and 229. The stockouts in P39 and P41 specifically indicate that the target stock must cover spikes above 250 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture these high-demand events, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the period from P29 to P46) to reflect this most recent regime accurately while maintaining enough history to capture the volatility (StdDev approx 26-28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $771.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29, with a mean of approximately 207 units and significant right-tail volatility (peaks reaching 260). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to maximize profit while minimizing terminal inventory, yet remaining robust against spikes to avoid lost sales. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current demand behavior, I am using a recent_N of 19 (covering periods 29-47) which characterizes the most recent stable regime. This provides a mu_hat of ~207 and accounts for the observed volatility in sigma_hat. This strategy ensures we maintain enough stock for the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision) while the 0-period lead time allows for responsive replenishments in the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 29, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 207 units with periodic spikes reaching up to 260 (as seen in Period 41). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To maximize reward while minimizing stockouts, I am setting the target stock level to cover the upper bound of this demand regime. For Period 49, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=20 to capture the current regime (P29-P48) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the higher mean (~207) and the significant volatility observed in recent weeks. The OR backend will calculate the base stock level using the service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, which helps balance the risk of holding costs against the $4 profit per unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 29. Analyzing the window from Period 29 to Period 49, the mean demand is approximately 207 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25. Recent stockouts in Periods 31, 39, 41, and 49 confirm that the target stock level needs to be robust against spikes reaching the 240-260 range. Period 49 had a demand of 237 resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit / $1 holding cost = 80% critical ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 21 periods (the current regime length) to capture the sustained mean of ~207 and the volatility that occasionally causes stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P29 remains stable but vulnerable to stockouts at spikes >230 (e.g., P49 demand 237 caused stockout). Mean demand in this regime is ~207.
