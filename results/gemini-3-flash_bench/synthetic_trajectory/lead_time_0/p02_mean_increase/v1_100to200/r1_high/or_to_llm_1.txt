Since P16, demand has been highly volatile but significantly higher (273, 170, 232, 116), averaging ~198.

The inclusion of the 17 low-demand periods (averaging ~100) significantly dilutes the recent high-demand regime, leading to an under-order. 5.

Assuming a mean of ~200 and high variance, I want roughly 280 units available (on-hand + current order) to prevent stockouts like the one in P16.

The current on-hand inventory is 50 units. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 40-47) shows an average demand of approximately 213 units, maintaining the regime shift identified around Period 29. The OR recommendation is 202 units. Given that we are at Period 48 of 50, we need to ensure enough stock to cover the immediate demand of Period 48 while being mindful of the game's end. With on-hand at 50, an order of 200 units provides a total availability of 250 units. Looking at the maximum demand in the recent stable period (260 in P41, 229 in P46), 250 units should safely satisfy the likely demand without incurring excessive holding costs for the final two periods. I will adjust the OR recommendation slightly upward to 200 (considering the ~213 average) to ensure we don't stock out, as the profit margin ($19) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1).",

{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 29, averaging approximately 207 units per period (Periods 29-48). The current period is 49 out of 50, meaning this is the final order to satisfy demand for the last period of the game. Historical analysis shows a lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR recommendation is 206 units, based on long-term stats, which aligns well with the recent 20-period average. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units. To ensure we cover potential high-end demand in the final period (recent peak was 260) while minimizing ending inventory costs, the target stock level should be approximately 250-260. Subtracting 47 on-hand units from 250 yields 203 units. OR's 206 is a safe and statistically sound quantity for the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "In Period 50, inventory levels for 'chips(Regular)' show an ending on-hand of 16 units from Period 49. Historically, the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand analysis indicates two major regime shifts: first at Period 16 and a second at Period 29. Calculating the average demand from Period 29 to Period 49, the mean is approximately 206.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 239 units, which is derived from historical data including the earlier low-demand periods. Given the target service level (95% critical fractile) and recent high-demand stability, I will follow the OR recommendation of 239 units. This quantity, combined with existing on-hand stock, creates a total availability of 255 units, which provides a comfortable safety buffer (approx. +2 standard deviations) against the recent demand mean of ~207 per period.",
