The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of this same period and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. To maximize profit while accounting for potential demand spikes and the high holding cost (equal to the profit margin), I will target an inventory level that covers the expected demand for the current and subsequent period to ensure a high service level while I observe the actual lead time performance.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand regime since Period 40 has been volatile but centered around a mean of ~185-190 units, with Recent periods (P47-P49) showing demand values of 214, 208, and 200 (Average = 207.3). This represents a slight upward stabilization compared to the previous 'cooling' phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Starting Period 50, on-hand inventory is 10 units. Since this is Period 50 (the final period), the objective is to satisfy this period's demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Based on the recent 3-period average of ~207, I will target 210 units of total inventory. With 10 on-hand, an order of 200 is placed. This accounts for the higher recent demand floor while limiting overstock risk in the final step.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Final demand regime (P47-P49) stabilized at approximately 207 units.",
