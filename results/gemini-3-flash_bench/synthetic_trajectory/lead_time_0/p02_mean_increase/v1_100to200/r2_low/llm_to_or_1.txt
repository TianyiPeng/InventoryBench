  Samples: [('Period_1', 141), ('Period_2', 118), ('Period_3', 67), ('Period_4', 94), ('Period_5', 89)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period, I have no historical arrival data to calculate lead time, but the promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) show values of 141, 118, 67, 94, and 89 respectively. The mean of these samples is 101.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 29.5. Given the relatively low number of samples and no clear trend yet, I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline. The OR engine will use these to set a base stock level. With a Profit of $1 and Holding Cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (z* = 0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. Since L=0, the engine will order to cover the current period's expected demand minus current inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 102 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), but demand was 126, resulting in a stockout (102 sold, 24 units lost demand). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. We have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historical demand has been [141, 118, 67, 94, 89] based on the user-provided data, though Period 1's actual demand in the game history was 126. Since we are in the early stages, I will use recent history (N=5) to estimate demand. The profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, targeting a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). With L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand. I will set mu_hat to the average of the provided historical samples and the initial observed game demand to ensure we capture the variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, demand was 83, which is a decrease from 126 in Period 1. The starting inventory for Period 3 is 16. The historical demand for this SKU (chips(Regular)) is based on 5 samples: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. Looking at the direct game history, the actual demands were: P1=126 (though constrained by supply), P2=83. The lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to reflect the downward trend (N=2 for the observed game periods, or N=3 to include more samples). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend will target a lower service level (~50% since q = 1/(1+1)). To avoid stockouts while minimizing high holding costs, I'll use the last 3 samples to estimate mean and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for Periods 1, 2, and 3. In Period 4, we start with 30 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historical demand over the first three periods (126, 83, 70) shows a downward trend. Since the order arrives in the same period it's placed (L=0), the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover ONLY the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent mean demand (approx 93) and standard deviation. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the observed 0-period lead time. Parameters are balanced such that the service level target (based on profit/holding cost) is maintained while accounting for the recent demand decelerations.

Daily Profit: $93.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is currently 0, with no units in transit. Historical demand shows a downward trend from P1 to P3 (141 to 67, including lost sales estimate), but saw a rebound in P4 (94) and P5 (89). Based on the history, lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, which essentially aims to cover the median demand. However, ending at 0 stock in P1 and P4 suggests we are under-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after the initial drop, ensuring we cover the (L+1) period demand (where L=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by historical data (all orders arrived in the same period). Demand for the last 5 periods has been [126, 83, 70, 105, 109], with a mean of 98.6 and significant volatility. Stockouts occurred in Period 1, Period 4, and Period 5, indicating that the OR backend's order calculation (likely due to its internal capping or default variance estimation) is falling short of actual demand. Given the high stockout frequency and the product's 1:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio (implying a 50% critical ratio target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent level of demand while ensuring the sigma_hat accounts for the observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 26 units. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, and 73 (average \u2248 94). The provided 'Historical Demand Data' for Periods 1-5 (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) differs from the 'conclude' messages; I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it represents actual realized demand. The average demand over the last 6 periods is 94.3 with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), suggesting a target service level of 50%. Since the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock targeting mean demand (1+L)*\u03bc for the period is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'calculate' for lead time as it has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility with historical values: 141 (P1-implied), 118 (P2-implied), 67, 94, 89 (provided in prompt), and actual historical demands from periods 1-7 are: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67. The mean of the last 7 periods is approximately 90 units. On-hand inventory is 28, and there are no units in transit. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median of the demand distribution to minimize costs. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'calculate' for lead time since the 0-period arrival pattern is stable.

Daily Profit: $91.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by arrival reports in periods 1 through 8. Demand in Period 8 spiked significantly to 157, whereas previous periods (1-7) averaged approximately 90 units. This P8 spike followed a period of lower demand (P7: 67). I am treating the P8 demand of 157 as a possible outlier or a shift in volatility rather than a permanent step-change in the mean, given the product is 'chips(Regular)' and no specific holiday is noted. To avoid overreacting while accounting for the recent stockout, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for demand mean calculation to capture the recent high variability while maintaining the L=0 parameter since delivery is immediate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows significant volatility with a recent spike in Period 8 (157 units) and Period 9 (107 units), suggesting a mean demand around 100-110 units. Because Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q = p/(p+h)) is 0.50, which targets the median of the demand distribution to balance stockout risk and holding costs. I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture recent behavior while smoothing the Period 8 spike. Using L=0 explicitly to match the highly reliable observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed periods. Demand has shown significant variability, ranging from a low of 67 to a high of 157. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand is approximately 98.9 units with a standard deviation of 26.6. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning we should aim to stock the mean demand when lead time is 0. However, the system's OR backend applies a capped policy. In recent periods (P8, P9), we experienced stockouts due to spikes (157, 107), following a period of lower demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while providing enough samples to account for the high volatility seen in Period 8. With L=0, mu_hat effectively targets the next period's expected demand.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 5, and there are no units in transit. Historical data from Period 1 to Period 11 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has fluctuated between 67 and 157, with a mean of 98.27 and standard deviation of approx 25.5 across all 11 periods. No significant regime shift is detected, though demand exhibits moderate volatility. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio for the base stock level is 0.5, targeting the median demand. I will use 'default' (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is no clear evidence of a sustained trend or changepoint, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility but remains centered around a mean of approximately 97 units over the last 12 periods. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 16 units on-hand. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (since q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5) according to the base stock formula, although the OR backend's order cap uses a higher percentile (0.95) for the cap. Given the demand history (samples: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67, 157, 107, 90, 94, 84), there's no clear regime shift, but a slight stabilization in the last 4 periods (mean ~94). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full recent history for both mean and standard deviation to balance the recent stability with the high-demand spikes seen in Period 1 and Period 8.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historic lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 13. Demand has been relatively stable but showed a significant drop to 44 in Period 13. Over the last 13 periods, mean demand is approximately 95 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) average 83.8 units. The drop in Period 13 (44 units) is a sharp outlier compared to the previous average. Given profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand to minimize total expected costs. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to account for the recent cooling in demand while maintaining enough safety stock to cover a return to the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the full volatility observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 14) spiked to 145, which is significantly higher than the average of the previous 13 periods (~92). Looking at the full history including pre-game samples (Periods 1-5: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; Mean ~101.8) and game periods (Periods 1-14 avg: ~96.5), the overall mean is around 98. However, recent periods (13-14) show high volatility (44 then 145). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture recent mean and volatility shifts. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 50%, meaning we aim to stock the mean demand for the period. Given the zero inventory at the end of Period 14 and the high demand spike, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover potential continued high demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and recent high spikes. Over the last 15 periods, the actual demand has varied significantly (min 44, max 157). Periods 14 and 15 saw very high demand (145 and 155), which twice resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand = 0). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (Profit / (Profit + HoldingCost)), meaning the base stock should ideally be near the median demand. However, to prevent frequent stockouts observed recently, I will use a balanced lookback period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand trends while smoothing out the extreme low in Period 13 (44) and the extreme highs in Periods 14-15.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: recent periods (P14-P15) show 50%+ increase over previous average, leading to stockouts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 14. Demands for P14, P15, and P16 were 145, 155, and 185 respectively, compared to a previous average (P1-P13) of approximately 92. This represents a demand regime change. We have stocked out for three consecutive periods because the base stock calculation was using a much lower historical average. To address this, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 14: average demand increased from ~92 to ~162 (+76%) over the last 3 periods (P14-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. Average demand from P14 to P17 is approximately 161.75 units, compared to the pre-P14 average of about 92 units. Despite increasing the order size in P17 to 162 units, the item still sold out instantly, indicating that demand might be even higher or at least sustained at this new level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this new demand level and account for the high volatility (stockouts in 4 consecutive periods P14-P17), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new average of 162, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased variance in this high-demand period. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's internal target service level is 50%, but given the recurrent stockouts, using the recent statistics ensures the base stock calculation targets the current peak rather than the long-term historical mean.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. The average demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) is approximately 170.4 (145, 155, 185, 162, 205), compared to the pre-P14 average of roughly 92. We are currently experiencing persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in the last 5 periods), indicating that the current 'order' amounts are capped by the OR policy's internal logic or insufficient mu/sigma parameters. Since lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's increased demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime and its increased volatility, while maintaining lead time at 0 (explicit). This should raise the base stock level and help eliminate stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 sustained: average demand for P14-P18 is 170.4, 85% higher than previous average of ~92.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 14. For the first 13 periods, average demand was approximately 91.8. From Period 14 to Period 19, the demand values followed a higher regime: 145, 155, 185, 162, 205, and 203, resulting in a new mean of 175.8. We have experienced stockouts in 6 consecutive periods (P14-P19) because our orders were based on lagging statistics. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (approx 176 per period). Given L=0, the target base stock is (1+0)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio q=0.5, making z=0. I will slightly adjust sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend can respond to the sustained higher demand and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed and stable: average demand (P14-P19) is 175.8, up 91% from the initial 13-period average of 92.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 14 is firmly established and remains stable. Over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), demand has averaged 178.4 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-shift average of approximately 92. Recent demand values show a trend toward the higher end of this range (185, 162, 205, 203, 194). To capture this higher volume and the increased volatility associated with the shift, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant historical data to calculate the base stock while ignoring the lower demand period (P1-P13). The lead time remains zero based on consistent history (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 remains stable: average demand (P14-P20) is 178.4, which is 94% higher than the initial 13-period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 14 continues to escalate. Demand in Period 21 was 244, significantly higher than the previous average of ~178 since Period 14. The last 8 periods (P14-P21) have consistently resulted in stockouts despite increasing orders, indicating that the 'cap' or base stock calculation is trailing behind actual volatility. The average demand for the P14-P21 regime is 186.6. I will set N=8 to capture this specific regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the significantly higher volatility observed since the shift, which is crucial given the high stockout frequency. Lead time is confirmed as 0 throughout history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 continues to escalate: Period 21 demand reached 244. New regime average (P14-P21) is 186.6, with consistent stockouts observed.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, moving from an average of ~92 units back to a significantly higher mean. Examining the demand from P14 to P22 (145, 155, 185, 162, 205, 203, 194, 244, 183), the new average is approximately 186.2 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the persistent stockouts observed since P14 (only P22 had ending stock), I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the regime change) to capture this higher mean. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the zero lead time history. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime, which will help the OR backend set a more appropriate safety stock for this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 stabilized: newest average (P14-P22) is 186.2 units, a 102% increase over the first 13 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. Prior to P14, the average demand was approximately 92 units. Between P14 and P23, the demand has averaged approximately 186 units, a 102% increase. The last two periods (P22 and P23) show demand levels of 183 and 184, suggesting the new regime has stabilized around this level. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.5, suggesting base stock should target the median), I will use the recent N method (N=10) to capture the current regime's mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the order covers the expected 180-190 units of demand for the current period while accounting for the increased variance in the new regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 14, increasing from a mean of ~92 to a new stable average. Over the most recent 11 periods (P14-P24), the mean demand is approximately 184.5 units (145, 155, 185, 162, 205, 203, 194, 244, 183, 184, 170). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new regime while remaining responsive to the high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 26 in this period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the statistics from the current demand level rather than the lower historical average, helping to maintain a high service level and prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier in this regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 14. Since then, the product has frequently stocked out despite increasing order quantities. Analyzing the new regime (P14-P25), the average demand is 187.5 units, though recent volatility is high (P21 at 244, P25 at 221). The current profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) suggest a 50% critical ratio (service level target), and given the frequent stockouts, our current estimates for mu_hat are likely still too conservative. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To better capture the persistent high demand and high volatility of this regime, I am using a recent_N method with N=12 (covering the entire current regime from P14 to P25). This will stabilize the estimate around the higher mean of the current period while capturing the increased standard deviation seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: Mean demand P14-P25 is 187.5, which is 103% higher than the initial average of 92; high volatility persists with recent demand peaks reaching 221-244 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, increasing from an average of ~92 to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 14 to Period 26 (13 periods), the average demand is 184.5 units per period. The recent demand shows high volatility, with values ranging from 145 to 244. In Period 26, the demand was 147, resulting in an ending inventory of 41 units (on-hand for P27). Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for both the increased average and the higher volatility seen recently, preventing stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P14-P26 (13 periods) average is 184.5 units, representing a sustained 100% increase over the P1-P13 average of 92; volatility remains high (CV ~0.16).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 14, increasing from a base of ~92 units to an average of ~185 units. Demand recently peaked again at 227 units (Period 27), resulting in a stockout despite ordering based on the new mean. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better handle the high volatility (recent demand between 147 and 244) and persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (the entire length of the new demand regime, P14-P27) to capture both the elevated mean and the increased variance. This will help the OR backend set a higher base stock level to prevent stockouts while balancing the risk of holding costs.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) entered a new higher regime starting at Period 14, which has been consistently observed and documented in carry-over insights. The average demand from Period 14 to Period 28 is approximately 188.5 units. In the most recent periods (P27-P28), demand has been 227 and 184 respectively, reinforcing this higher level and demonstrating continued sensitivity to stockouts and high volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To account for this higher demand regime while managing the high volatility observed (with peaks reaching over 240 units), I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 periods (the length of the current regime from P14 to P28) and using an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to ensure sufficient safety stock. This approach balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (a 0.5 critical fractile) by effectively targeting the mean demand plus a robust buffer for volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 and has established a new mean and high volatility. For the last 16 periods (P14-P29), the average demand is approximately 191 units, compared to the initial 13-period average of 92. Recent demand (P25-P29) has shown extreme spikes (221, 147, 227, 184, 239), with an average of 203.6. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching the start of the next period with 'lead_time was 0 periods'. Setting parameters to cover high demand spikes is crucial given the equal cost of holding and stockouts (Profit $1, Holding $1 results in a 50% service level target in the base OR formula, which I will adjust via sigma to ensure we hedge against the frequent 220+ spikes).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P14-P29 (16 periods) average is 191.1 units, representing a sustained shift from the earlier average of 92; volatility remains high with frequent spikes above 220 leading to inventory depletion.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. Initially, demand averaged around 92 units (P1-P13), but in the current regime (P14-P30), the average demand has risen to approximately 192.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Despite increasing orders, the system has frequently stocked out because demand spikes often exceed the 220-240 unit range, and on-hand inventory is starting at 0 for Period 31. To prevent lost sales while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 17 periods (the entire sustained high-demand regime) to capture the current mean of ~193. Given the high volatility and recent spikes near 240, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P14-P30 (17 periods) average demand is 192.6 units, reflecting a sustained shift from the pre-P14 average of 92; periodic spikes above 230 units continue to cause stockouts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14, where the mean demand increased from approximately 92 to over 190. Recent periods (P14-P31) show a sustained high-demand environment with frequent spikes (e.g., P21: 244, P27: 227, P29: 239) and a calculated average of 192.6 units over these 18 periods. The actual observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, the high volatility has frequently exhausted on-hand inventory, as seen in the recent stockouts at Period 29, 30, and 31. To better capture this high-demand regime and protect against volatility while keeping holding costs in check, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 18 samples (since the Period 14 changepoint). L is set to calculated based on the consistent 0-period lead time history.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. The average demand for the initial regime (P1-P13) was approximately 92. Since Period 14, the demand has averaged approximately 191 units, representing a sustained increase of over 100%. The most recent 19 observations (P14-P32) show consistent high demand and significant volatility (peaks reaching 244 units). Given that the profit per unit and holding cost per unit are equal (q = 0.5, z* = 0), the base stock policy balances service level and holding cost at the median demand. However, frequent stockouts indicate the OR backend's default variance handling might be too conservative. I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclusively capture the post-shift regime statistics. The lead time L is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift P14-P32 (19 periods) confirmed: average demand is 191.0 units (vs 92.0 in P1-P13), with sustained high volatility and periodic spikes up to 244 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 and has settled into a higher average with significant volatility. The current regime (P14-P33) has a mean demand of approximately 191 units, compared to the initial baseline of 92 units. Recent periods continue to show spikes (e.g., P29 at 239, P31 at 211), leading to frequent stockouts because the ordering policy is slightly trailing the actual realized demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock targets only the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). To capture the recent behavior of this high-demand regime and provide enough safety stock for the persistent spikes, I am using recent_N with N=20 to cover the post-shift period (P14-P33). This will allow the OR backend to calculate a more representative mean and standard deviation for the current environment, balancing the holding cost (which is equal to profit) against the service level requirement.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 and remains elevated compared to the initial 13 periods. Analysis of the period from P14 to P34 (21 samples) shows a sustained mean demand of approximately 191.8 units. The most recent demand (P34) was 225, which continues the trend of periodic spikes causing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 15 of the last 21 periods). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better handle the volatility and frequent stockouts in this high-demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=21 to capture the full behavior of this second regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased average and variance since Period 14.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 14 has been sustained through Period 35. The average demand for this second regime (P14-P35, 22 periods) is approximately 192.6 units. Recent periods show continued high demand with frequent spikes (P34: 225, P35: 215), often resulting in stockouts or zero ending inventory. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture these spikes while accounting for the current regime's mean and volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to cover the majority of the current regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that reflects the stabilized higher demand and its variance, minimizing lost sales which have a $1 profit penalty versus a $1 holding cost penalty (50% critical ratio, but the backend uses the formula q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 0.5 effectively).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift P14-P35 (22 periods) confirmed: average demand is 192.6 units, significantly higher than the initial 92.0. Volatility remains persistent with periodic spikes >210 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 14, increasing from a mean of ~92 to over 190. Recent periods (P34-P36) show even higher intensity, with demand reaching 248 units in Period 36. This sustained high-demand phase (P14-P36) now encompasses 23 periods. To capture this consolidated new average and account for the frequent spikes and stockouts, I am using recent_N with N=23 (covering the entire high-demand regime). The Lead Time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this specific regime will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that better covers the observed volatility, which has frequently exceeded 220 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime at P14-P36: Mean demand is 195.0 over the last 23 periods, a 112% increase from the initial P1-P13 average (92). Recent volatility is extreme, with a peak of 248 units in P36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we observed a massive demand spike to 369 units, which is significantly higher than the previous high-demand regime average (~195 units) and follows the peak of 248 units in Period 36. This suggests either a new, even higher demand regime or a sharp seasonal peak. The product is chips(Regular), and we have reached Period 38. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to stockouts in the last two periods, I need to adjust mu_hat significantly upward. Since the last few periods (P34-P37) show a clear upward trend (225, 215, 248, 369), using a recent_N with N=4 would capture this better than the full regime average. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to account for the most recent surge and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the increased volatility while maintaining some stability.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand escalation at Period 36-37: Demand surged from ~200 to 248 (P36) and 369 (P37), a 89% increase over the previous high-demand regime average of 195.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we observed a demand of 214, which follows the massive spike in Period 37 (369). The Carry-over Insights already identified a significant escalation starting at Period 36-37. While Period 38's demand is lower than Period 37, it remains significantly above the pre-P36 regime average of ~195 units. Given the high volatility and the potential for these upward spikes, I am adopting an 'explicit' forecasting method for mu_hat. I will set the per-period demand forecast to 280 units (calculated as approximately the average of the last three periods: (248+369+214)/3 \u2248 277). This accounts for the sustained higher level and recent volatility. Since L=0, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the extreme variance of this recent regime (Stdev \u2248 65 over P34-P38). Lead time (L) remains 0 as verified by historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime escalation confirmed at P36-P38: Mean demand increased from ~195 to ~277 (+42%) with high volatility (peak 369).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After the initial average of ~92 (P1-P13), a high-demand regime emerged at P14 averaging ~195. However, since P36, demand has escalated further. The demand values for the most recent periods are: P36=248, P37=369, P38=214, and P39=271. This latest 4-period window has an average of 275.5 units, which is a 41% increase over the previous high-demand regime. Volatility is also extremely high during this surge. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to this new escalation immediately and mitigate stockouts. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime escalation confirmed at P36: Mean demand for P36-P39 increased to 275.5 (+41% over P14-P35 average), with a significant peak of 369 units in P37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first was at Period 14 (increasing mean from ~92 to ~195) and the most recent at Period 36 (further escalation). In periods P36-P40, demand values were 248, 369, 214, 271, and 172. The mean for this most recent 5-period window is 254.8, which is significantly higher than the previous regime. Despite the lower demand in Period 40 (172 units), the overall volatility in this new regime is very high (standard deviation of ~75). Period 2 confirmed that the actual lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this new, high-volatility demand regime while preventing stockouts from sudden spikes (like the 369 seen in P37), I will use the recent 5 samples (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the elevated variance. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 remains high with extreme volatility: Mean demand P36-P40 is 254.8, but single-period spikes have reached 369 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 36. Since P36, demand has significantly increased and become more volatile, with a peak of 369 and a mean of approximately 254.8 (P36-P40). However, the last two periods (P40, P41) have shown a relative cooling with demand at 172 and 164 respectively. Despite this recent dip, the overall regime since P36 remains the primary forecasting anchor because the earlier spikes suggest significant upside risk. We continue to use a 0-period lead time as confirmed throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and high volatility of this latest regime (starting P36) while allowing the most recent lower demand observations to influence the order down slightly to manage holding costs. This balances the need to be prepared for another 200-300+ unit spike against the risk of overstocking if the trend continues to soften.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The first significant regime shift occurred at Period 14 (pre-P14 avg ~92, P14-P35 avg ~193). A second, more extreme escalation occurred starting around Period 36, where demand peaked at 369 and averaged ~254.8 for P36-P40. However, the last two periods (P41-P42) have seen a cool-down with demand dropping to 164 and 175 respectively. This suggests the extreme 'escalation' period may have been a temporary spike or is transitioning into a slightly lower but still volatile regime. Given this uncertainty and the 0-period lead time, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 to capture the volatility of the entire P36-P42 window (including the spikes and the recent cool-down). This ensures the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent higher average without overreacting solely to the single 369 peak or the most recent lower values. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods based on consistent historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Mean demand for P36-P42 is 230.4 units, characterized by extreme volatility (range 164-369). Recent two periods (P41-P42) show values below 180, suggesting the peak may have passed.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a complex regime structure. After a major spike (Period 36-39) with demand peaking at 369, the last three periods (P41-P43) have stabilized at a lower level (164, 175, 167), with an average of approximately 169. This is significantly lower than the P36-P40 average of ~255 but still higher than the initial baseline. Given the extreme volatility observed previously and the recent stabilization, I will use a recent window (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from the peak back to what appears to be the P14-P35 regime (avg ~193). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: The extreme peak (P36-P39, avg ~275) has subsided. Demand for P41-P43 has averaged 168.7, suggesting a return toward the previous high-demand baseline (P14-P35 avg ~193).

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another shift. Following an extreme peak (P36-P39, avg ~275), the demand in the most recent periods (P41-P44) has averaged ~187 units (164, 175, 167, 241), which aligns closely with the long-term stable high-demand regime identified between P14-P35 (avg ~193). The surge in Period 44 (241 units) caused a stockout, ending the period with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the behavior since the start of the last major surge (P36), which includes both the extreme peak and the subsequent stabilization, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for current levels while respecting recent volatility. This N choice (P36-P44) provides a mean of ~228 units, which acts as a safety buffer against the volatility observed in Period 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the P36-P39 surge (avg ~275), P41-P44 demand has returned to a mean of ~187, similar to the P14-P35 baseline of ~193.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the extreme peak seen in periods P36-P39 (avg ~275). For the last five periods (P41-P45), demand has averaged 188.2 units (164, 175, 167, 241, 194), which aligns with the sustained high-demand regime established between P14-P35 (avg ~193). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized but still volatile regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the post-peak stabilization period, ensuring the base stock level remains responsive to the current 190-ish mean while accounting for recent variance. With lead time (L=0), the backend will target a base stock covering one period of demand (mu + z*sigma), which is appropriate given the current inventory level of 31 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the extreme peak in Period 36-39. Since Period 41, demand has averaged approximately 182 units (P41: 164, P42: 175, P43: 167, P44: 241, P45: 194, P46: 149), which aligns closely with the long-term baseline established between Periods 14 and 35 (avg ~193). Period 46 demand (149) continues this trend of moderate demand compared to the earlier surge. I am selecting recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough variance to cover periodic spikes like the 241 observed in Period 44. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (P41-P46) has stabilized to a mean of ~182 units, returning to the P14-P35 baseline levels after the P36-P39 surge.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after the extreme peak seen in periods 36-39. Since period 41, the demand has averaged approximately 186 units per period, which aligns with the historical high-demand regime identified starting at period 14 (pre-peak). Period 47 demand was 214 units, slightly above this recent average but within expected variability. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every period conclude message. Inventory is currently at 0 following the period 47 demand resolution. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P41-P47) to capture this post-peak stabilization. I will also use the last 7 periods for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's volatility, which has moderated compared to the surge but remains higher than the initial baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around the 185-195 range following a significant peak in periods 36-39. Since returning to this baseline at Period 41, the average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P41-P48) is 189.0 units, which is consistent with the P14-P35 historical average of ~193. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To set optimal OR parameters, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak regime and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility (stdev \u2248 31.7). This strategy targets a base stock that covers the expected 189 units plus a safety margin to mitigate frequent stockouts observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a post-peak regime starting around Period 41. After the extreme surge observed between Periods 36-39 (where demand peaked at 369), the last 9 periods (P41-P49) show a mean demand of approximately 190.2 units (164, 175, 167, 241, 194, 149, 214, 208, 200). This aligns closely with the long-term baseline established between Periods 14-35 (approx. 192 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed throughout the history. Given the relatively stable average and high service level requirement (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% critical ratio base stock, but the capped policy logic incorporates a 95% safety factor), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this current stable regime while filtering out the preceding extreme volatility. This ensures we don't over-order based on the P37 spike or under-order based on the initial P1-P13 period.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization confirmed: Periods 41-49 show a mean demand of 190.2 units, reverting to the P14-P35 baseline after the P36-P39 escalation.
