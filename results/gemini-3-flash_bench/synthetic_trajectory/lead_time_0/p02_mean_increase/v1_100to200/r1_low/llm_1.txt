Since the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival) and we currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the high variability (SD \u2248 28) and the starting average, a prudent initial order would target the historical average plus a small buffer to account for the risk of a high-demand period 1. I will order 120 units to establish a stock level capable of meeting expected demand while acknowledging that lead time is 0, so the units should arrive during the arrival resolution phase of this period.",

Given the recent demand average (~110-120) and the risk of stockouts shown in previous periods, I will aim for a higher service level. I will order 130 units to cover potential demand spikes while minimizing the holding cost risk, considering the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0).

I need to determine if this is a shift or an outlier. The promised lead time of 0 is confirmed by historical 'concluded' messages (P1-P6 all arrived same-period). Profit is $1.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, meaning the marginal cost of a stockout equals the cost of holding one unit; this suggests a target service level of roughly 50% (Newsvendor logic: P < P/(P+H)). Currently, I have 84 units on hand. If Period 6 (46) represents a new demand regime, I am already overstocked. If the demand reverts to the previous mean (~112), I need about 28 more units to cover the expected demand for Period 7.
