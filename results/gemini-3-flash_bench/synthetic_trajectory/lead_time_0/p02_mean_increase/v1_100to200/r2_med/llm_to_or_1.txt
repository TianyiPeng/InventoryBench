Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_0\p02_mean_increase\v1_100to200\r2_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 141), ('Period_2', 118), ('Period_3', 67), ('Period_4', 94), ('Period_5', 89)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or previous arrival information to process. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The goal is to set parameters that cover the demand of the current period since the base stock formula (base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) will be evaluated before the arrival and demand resolution. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 141, 118, 67, 94, and 89. The average demand across these samples is 101.8, and the standard deviation is 28.9. For Period 1, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these 5 samples. With L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (0+1) periods, so I'll set mu_hat to 102 and sigma_hat to 29. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and variability for the current cycle.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 126 units for 'chips(Regular)'. An order of 127 units placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), leaving 1 unit on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and the first period's observation confirms an actual lead time of 0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) are 141, 118, 67, 94, and 89, though the 'Game History' specifically reported 126 for Period 1. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is approximately 80% (4/(4+1)). I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the provided historical variance, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Historical demand for the first 2 periods was 126 and 83 units respectively (mean = 104.5), while additional samples provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5) show values of 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. The observed lead time for both concluded periods (P1 and P2) was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect this consistency. For demand (mu_hat), since we have a small sample set showing a downward trend from the initial high (141 to 67), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the most recent information more heavily while still providing a buffer against the variability shown in the extended sample history. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility. This setup ensures that the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means current period only) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirms that orders arrive within the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been decreasing over the first three periods (126 -> 83 -> 70), though the sample size is small. I will use a recent_N approach to capture this downward trend for both demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given the history, N=3 is appropriate to reflect the most recent regime while maintaining some stability. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current inventory (49 units) and the expected demand for the upcoming period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Reviewing history: Promised lead time is 0, and all shipments (Periods 1-4) have arrived with an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently low (13 units) following a demand spike of 105 in Period 4. Historical demand samples are [141, 118, 67, 94, 89] (from provided samples) and [126, 83, 70, 105] (from game history). The game history demand shows higher volatility and a slight downward trend compared to the initial samples. Since lead time is consistently 0, the (1+L) factor is 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent local demand trend (mean ~96) and volatility from the game play history, ensuring the base stock covers current period variability without overstocking, given the $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Daily Profit: $436.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 126, 83, 70, 105, 109 (samples provided in prompt align closely: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; however, I will prioritize concluded demand: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109). The average demand is approximately 98.6. Promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms actual lead time is 0 (arrivals happen in the same period as orders). Inventory is lean (8 units on hand). Since demand fluctuates between roughly 70 and 126 without a clear trend or seasonal marker (specific dates not provided beyond generic 'Period_X'), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history and handle the current volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 6 while accounting for the observed standard deviation (~22) to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs ($1/unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 6 periods shows fluctuations but remains relatively stable around a mean of 94.33. Specifically, the demands observed are: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, and 73. All orders placed from Period 1 to Period 6 arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Currently, we have 45 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the service level target (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent variance while smoothing the mean. L is set to 'default' as lead time is consistently 0.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met from Period 1 to Period 7, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate fluctuation without a clear seasonal trend in the first 7 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) as the 0-period performance is stable. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 3 to 7) to capture the more recent demand environment which averages approximately 84.8 units per period, compared to the higher starting demand in Periods 1 and 2. This approach balances the need for responsiveness to recent trends while maintaining a sufficient sample size for variance calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand spiked to 157, significantly higher than the previous 7-period average of ~90. This caused a stockout (sold 102 units, ending inventory 0). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by orders arriving within the same period they were placed (P1-P8). To prevent future stockouts while acknowledging the recent high demand, I will transition to using a slightly more responsive demand estimate. While P8 might be an outlier, the stockout suggests we were under-provisioned. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent variability and the recent spike, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*demand is sufficient to cover the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 units in-transit. Based on the game history for chips(Regular), the lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, arriving in the same period as ordered. Demand has shown significant volatility recently (P8: 157, P9: 107) compared to the initial periods. The mean demand across all 9 periods is approximately 99.6, but the last 3 periods (P7-P9) show a higher average demand of 110.3 and notable variance. Given the stockout in Period 8 where demand (157) significantly exceeded starting inventory (102), I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the current volatility and higher mean better than the full history. Setting L=0 explicitly captures the observed behavior. A higher sigma_hat is expected via recent_N to protect against the high variability seen in Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand over the first 10 periods has a mean of 98.7 units and a standard deviation of 27.6 units. Recent periods (P8-P10) showed a significant spike in Period 8 (157 units) followed by moderate levels. There is no clear seasonal indicator or major trend shift yet, so 'default' (using all historical samples) is appropriate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full volatility. The holding cost is relatively high compared to profit ($1 vs $4), so the OR backend should maintain a safety stock that balances the risk of stockouts (as seen in Period 8) against holding costs. Since lead time is consistently 0, I will use 'calculate' for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 29 units. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 11, the average demand is approximately 98.27 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To calculate mu_hat (expected demand for the review + lead time period, which is 1+L = 1), I look at recent performance. Demand has been relatively stable, with a slight spike in Period 8 (157), but generally hovering between 67 and 109. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the mean demand is 103 units. Given the service level target (critical ratio q = 0.8), I will use the recent N (N=11) to capture the overall mean and volatility, which provides a balanced buffer against recent fluctuations like the stockout in Period 8.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met for all 12 periods, so I will continue using L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but shows stability around a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 12 periods. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 84, and the last 10 periods average 93.6. I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this level of demand and volatility while filtering out the initial Period 1 high demand (126). With a current on-hand inventory of 37 and no in-transit units, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the current period's demand. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.8, which the backend will use to determine the safety stock component of mu_hat + z*sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent downward trend, specifically in Period 13 where demand dropped to 44 units, compared to the previous 12-period average of approximately 102 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the current on-hand inventory of 74 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand, there is a risk of overstocking if parameters aren't adjusted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent cooling of demand and minimize holding costs while the OR backend maintains the target service level (80% based on profit/cost ratio). L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 14, where demand (145) significantly exceeded starting inventory (104). Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 14, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand is volatile but lacks a clear regime shift, with an overall mean of approximately 97 units. Period 14 saw a significant spike (145), similar to the spike in Period 8 (157). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 10 periods. This N=10 captures recent behavior while smoothing out the extreme high in P14 and the extreme low in P13. L is set to default as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 14 and 15) shows a significant spike to 145 and 155 units, which is well above the earlier average of ~93 units (Periods 1-13). Period 8 also saw a high demand of 157. This suggests a more volatile demand environment or a shift to a higher-demand regime. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 14 and 15, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast. I will forecast a mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (approx 115) and account for the high variance (std dev of recent periods is around 50). Setting mu_hat to 135 and sigma_hat to 45 provides a more aggressive buffer for the current period's demand (since L=0, mu_hat represents 1 period of demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 14, with peaks exceeding 150 units, compared to the early average of ~93.

Daily Reward (R_t): $692.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant upward shift starting from Period 14. Demands for the last three periods were 145, 155, and 185, which are substantially higher than the historical average (~93). This indicates a new demand regime. The previous carry-over insight noted volatility, but the sustained trend suggests a mean shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to 173 units arriving in P16 being completely sold out by a demand of 185. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this growth and mitigate stockouts (service level target ~80% based on profit/cost), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P14-P16). This will allow the base stock to respond quickly to the current peak demand while reflecting the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~93 to ~162 (+74%) over the last 3 periods (P14-P16) with consistent stockouts.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 14 is firmly established. Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand values were 145, 155, 185, and 162, resulting in three consecutive stockouts until Period 17's order caught up. The mean demand for this recent regime (N=4) is 161.75. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to prioritize the current high-demand state over historical lower averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Historical demand from P1 to P13 averaged ~93 units, whereas the average demand from P14 to P18 has jumped to approximately 170 units (145, 155, 185, 162, 205). The most recent period (P18) saw a peak demand of 205, leading to a stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N method with N=5 (P14-P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the current high-mean, high-variance environment. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, the backend will order to reach the new base stock level immediately to prevent further stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels (P14-P18 average ~170 units), representing an ~83% increase from the initial period average (~93). Demand volatility has also increased with recent peaks exceeding 200.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Prior to this, demand averaged ~93 units. From Period 14 to Period 19, demand has significantly increased, with the last 5 observations being 145, 155, 185, 162, 205, and 203 (mean ~176). We are currently facing zero on-hand inventory due to consistent stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history. To capture this higher demand regime and its increased volatility, I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the last 6 periods (N=6, covering Period 14-19). This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent average of ~176 and the higher standard deviation observed in this new regime, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully established: Mean demand for Period 14-19 is ~176 units, confirming a sustained ~89% increase from the initial baseline (~93). Volatility (sigma) is also significantly higher in this regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. The baseline demand (Periods 1-13) averaged approximately 93 units, whereas the current regime (Periods 14-20) has seen a mean demand of approximately 178 units\u2014a near doubling. Recent periods (18-20) specifically show high sustained demand (205, 203, 194). Despite the high demand, the Promised Lead Time of 0 has consistently held true, as confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (L=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). To capture this new high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the recent stabilization above the initial shift mean, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire Period 14-20 regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to meet a mean of ~178 plus a safety buffer for the increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial baseline (Periods 1-13) averaged ~93 units. Since Period 14, demand has surged, with the last 8 periods (P14-P21) averaging ~187 units. In the most recent period (P21), demand hit a peak of 244 units, resulting in a stockout despite ordering 195 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, as orders placed in each period have arrived within the same period. To capture the current high-demand state and account for the recent volatility peak, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the ~187 mean demand plus a safety stock buffer based on recent volatility, aiming to prevent the recurring stockouts seen in Periods 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak: Period 21 reached a new high of 244 units, bringing the average for the high-demand regime (P14-P21) to ~187 units (+101% from initial baseline).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant structural shift starting around Period 14. Prior to this, demand averaged ~93 units. Since Period 14, the average demand has risen to approximately 191 units (P14-P22 avg: 145, 155, 185, 162, 205, 203, 194, 244, 183). We have seen multiple stockouts despite increasing order quantities, indicating high volatility alongside the increased mean. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all concluded transactions. To capture this high-demand regime while accounting for recent high-variance spikes (e.g., 244 in P21), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (spanning P14-P22) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with the new demand distribution. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 persisted through Period 22: Recent 9-period average demand is ~191 units, a ~105% increase from the initial baseline (~93). Volatility remains high with a peak of 244 in Period 21.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. The baseline demand (P1-P13) was approximately 93 units/period, but from Period 14 to Period 23, the average has risen to approximately 186 units/period, a 100% increase. The last 10 periods (P14-P23) show consistent high demand with frequent stockouts (P14, P15, P16, P18, P19, P21), indicating that the actual demand is often higher than what was captured in 'sold' units. The most recent demand (P21: 244, P22: 183, P23: 184) suggests the high-demand regime is stable. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new regime and handle the high volatility (sigma), I am setting N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N covers the entire new regime (P14-P23), providing a more accurate mean (~186) and volatility estimate for the current environment compared to use the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the high-demand state: The 10-period average (P14-P23) is ~186 units per period, characterized by high volatility (peaks >240) and frequent stockouts when inventory is below 200.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14, increasing from a baseline of ~93 to a current high-demand state. For the most recent 11 periods (P14-P24), the mean demand is approximately 180 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~26), including peaks up to 244. We are currently in Period 25. The on-hand inventory is 40 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' (which defaults effectively to 0 based on history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the properties of this high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand and provides a buffer against the observed volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, moving from an initial average of ~93 to a high-demand state. For the current period, I am looking at the most recent regime (Periods 14-25). Over these 12 periods, the mean demand is 187.58, with a standard deviation of 27.95 and peaks reaching 244. Period 25 saw demand spike to 221, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The Lead Time (L) remains consistently 0, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, the system must order enough to satisfy Period 26's demand from scratch. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full dynamics of this high-demand regime while allowing for the high volatility observed (std ~28). This targets a service level dictated by the critical ratio q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shifted significantly around Period 14 and has remained in a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is approximately 189.3 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~93. Period 26 showed a slight dip to 147, but this does not yet constitute a downward trend, as Period 25 was 221 and Period 21 was 244. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by arrival reports in every conclude message. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-mean/high-variance regime while ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that prevents the stockouts observed throughout the P14-P25 interval. On-hand at start of P27 is 65, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains consistently high: 10-period average (P17-P26) is ~189 units, with persistent volatility (std dev ~30). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-demand regime that started around Period 14. In the most recent period (P27), demand was 227 units, causing another stockout. Analyzing the demand from Period 14 to Period 27 (the current regime), the average demand is approximately 188 units with a standard deviation of about 29 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, setting N=14 to capture the entire high-demand regime data. This allows the OR backend to calculate base stock levels based on the current higher mean and volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 14 and has remained in a high-demand state. For the last 12 periods (P17-P28), the average demand is approximately 185.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.8. The most recent demand (P28) was 184 units, aligning with this regime. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To maximize reward while avoiding frequent stockouts seen in this high-demand phase, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the current regime's behavior. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the increased mean (~185) and the volatility (std ~28) observed since the shift, ensuring a higher service level for this high-profit (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) item.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the mean demand is approximately 199.9 units, with significant volatility (highs of 244 and 239). The current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 29, where 218 units were sold against a demand of 239. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this established high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current mean of ~200 and the observed volatility to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher levels (P20-P29 average: 199.9 units) compared to the initial baseline (~93). High volatility persists with frequent demand spikes above 230.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 14. Over the last 11 periods (P20-P30), the mean demand is approximately 201 units (average of 194, 244, 183, 184, 170, 221, 147, 227, 184, 239, 216). This is more than double the initial baseline of ~93. Volatility remains significant, with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units in this high-demand state. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent frequent stockouts observed in recent periods (P25, P27, P29), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility precisely. This ensures the base stock calculation, which targets a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% critical ratio), is based on the most relevant historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: 11-period average (P20-P30) is ~201 units, maintaining the ~116% increase from baseline with persistent volatility (std dev ~31).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 14. For the most recent 12-period block (Period 20 to Period 31), the mean demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 30.2 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are used in Period N), our total inventory target (base stock) needs to cover Period 32's demand. Given a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 16 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the characteristics of this stable high-demand regime (P20-P31), effectively setting the base stock to roughly 201 + 0.84 * 30 = 226 units. This ensures we satisfy the high demand while minimizing stockout risk observed in previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 14 (approx. 200 units/period) compared to the initial baseline (~93). The last 10 periods (P23-P32) show a mean demand of 185.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Currently, we have 66 units on hand. To maintain the target service level in this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current state's mean (~185) and variance. This strategy ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent demand spikes (up to 244 units) and frequent stockouts while avoiding over-stocking during slight dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $717.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently high since Period 14, with a recent 14-period average (P20-P33) of approximately 201 units. Period 33 demand was 188 units, maintaining this level. On-hand inventory is currently low (35 units) due to the system's focus on servicing the high demand from the previous period's arrival. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels given the sustained demand and persistent volatility (recent peaks >230), I will continue using a recent window of 14 periods (N=14) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to cover the elevated baseline while accounting for the significant variance observed in this stage to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 14 and has remained in a high-demand state. For the most recent 15 periods (P20-P34), the average demand is approximately 199.6 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~93. Period 34 saw a demand of 225, confirming that the high-demand state continues with notable volatility (standard deviation remains around 30). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this stable but high-demand, high-volatility environment, I will use a recent window of N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current regime's mean and variance while ignoring the irrelevant low-demand data from the first third of the game history. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate based on consistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in its high-state: 15-period average (P20-P34) is ~200 units per period. Volatility (sigma) is consistently higher than baseline, with peaks frequently exceeding 230.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high-demand state since approximately Period 14-17, with the average demand over the last 15 periods (P21-P35) being approximately 199.3 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in the history. Profit is $4 and Holding Cost is $1, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84), which warrants a robust safety stock to prevent the frequent stockouts observed. I am using recent_N (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this high-demand regime while excluding the initial lower-demand baseline. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the elevated mean (~200) and the persistent volatility (std dev ~31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $904.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level since roughly Period 14-20. Focusing on the most recent 16 periods (P21-P36) as the current regime, the mean demand is approximately 201 units. Period 36 showed a high demand of 248, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Since the lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N), I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover current demand plus a safety buffer to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. Given the recent variability (peaks > 240), using a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the average demand of ~201 and the associated volatility (~31). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the high-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $920.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we observed a massive demand spike to 369 units, which is significantly higher than the already elevated regime average of ~200 units. This represents a potential new demand shift or a significant seasonal peak. Because this is the first instance of such an extreme value, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock covers this new level of demand (forecasted at 350 for the review + lead period) while maintaining a high service level to avoid another total stockout. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to account for the increased volatility evidenced by this recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 37: demand jumped to 369 units, a ~85% increase from the previous high-demand regime average of ~200. Monitoring for sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $677.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, a major demand spike occurred (369 units), which was significantly higher than the previous high-demand regime average of ~200. I responded by ordering 393 units in Period 38. Period 38 demand returned to a level more consistent with the established high-demand regime (214 units), resulting in 179 units of ending on-hand inventory. The spike in P37 appears to be an outlier or a temporary surge rather than a new sustained regime, as P38 returned to the previous range. The high-demand regime from P20-P38 (excluding the P37 outlier) has an average of approximately 205 units with a standard deviation around 35. I will use a recent_N of 19 (covering P20-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior while moderating the impact of the P37 outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: The Period 37 demand spike (369 units) appears to be an outlier as Period 38 demand returned to the 200-250 range (214 units). The demand regime remains stable at an average of ~205 units (P20-P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, demand was 271, which is higher than the established regime average (~200) but consistent with the volatility observed in this high-demand segment. The large order placed in Period 38 (393 units) acted as a buffer, but we ended Period 39 with 0 inventory due to the high demand. The demand spike in Period 37 (369 units) remains an outlier, but recent demand (P37-P39) averages ~284, suggesting a possible upward drift or sustained high volatility. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the high-regime mean (~231 per period) and volatility, as this N-count covers the period including the recent spike and the subsequent stabilization. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-demand regime characterized by a mean of approximately 213 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~50) over the last 10 periods. A significant outlier occurred in Period 37 (369 units), which momentarily inflated demand expectations, but subsequent periods (38-40) have returned to the 170-270 range. Currently, we have 108 units on hand. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture the current regime while discounting the extreme outlier of Period 37, I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (covering Period 31 to 40, which includes the spike and recent lower values to balance the mean) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the elevated volatility observed in this regime. This ensures the base stock (approx. mean + 0.84 * sigma) covers the high end of typical demand while managing holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level since Period 20, following an initial jump at Period 14. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 41 is approximately 211 units, excluding the extreme outlier in Period 37 (369 units). Recent observations (P38-P41) show demand of 214, 271, 172, and 164, maintaining this higher mean but with significant variance. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To calculate mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P32-P41) to capture the current mean of 218 units (including the outlier) which provides a safe buffer against the high volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 10 to reflect the current high-volatility state. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1), ensuring a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: The average demand since Period 20 (excluding P37 outlier) has settled around 204 units, with persistent high volatility and occasional spikes exceeding 250 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-demand level since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 204 units (excluding the outlier in Period 37). Recent demand (P40-P42) has been slightly lower (172, 164, 175), but given the high historical volatility (sigma ~31-40) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is prudent to maintain a base stock that covers the established high-demand mean to prevent stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the broad high-demand regime, and for sigma_hat I will use the the same window to reflect current volatility levels. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level (q) of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), providing a safety buffer for potential spikes while accounting for the recent moderate demand values.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 20-43 (excluding the P37 outlier) has stabilized at an average of approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of about 37. Recent demand (P40-P43) has been slightly lower (avg 169.5), which might suggest a minor cooling or just natural volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 85 units. Using current regime statistics (N=24 periods, P20-P43), the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that accounts for a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Given the high volatility observed (spikes >300), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the most relevant distribution while smoothing out the extreme outlier at P37 and the recent minor dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average demand from Period 20 to 43 (excluding P37 spike) is 201 units. Standard deviation remains high (~37). Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around an average of 201-205 units (P20-P44), with a notable outlier in P37 (369 units). Recent demand (P40-P44) has shown values of 172, 164, 175, 167, and 241, maintaining the high-state average but showing significant variance. Current on-hand inventory is low (21 units) following a demand of 241. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20 to capture the stable high-demand regime) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained higher volatility in this phase. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~200+ units while buffering against the observed volatility (std dev ~37).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high-demand state since approximately Period 20. Excluding the notable outlier in Period 37 (369 units), the average demand from Period 20 to 45 is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 36.6. Recent demand (P44: 241, P45: 194) confirms this range. Inventory is currently at 61 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently met (actual lead time is 0), L is set to 'default'. I will use 'recent_N' with N=25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistics of this stable high-demand regime (starting around Period 20) while excluding the early lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects current volume and volatility to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

The demand regime has been stable since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 201 units (excluding the outlier in Period 37). Specifically, the last 7 periods (P40-P46) show an average demand of 180.3 units, indicating a slight softening compared to the earlier high-regime average, but well within historical variance (std dev ~35-40). The carry-over insights confirm this long-term stability. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established 'high-demand' regime's statistics while filtering out the noise from the early low-demand phase and the period 37 outlier. This will allow the OR engine to maintain a sufficient service level for the $4 profit margin against $1 holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a high level since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 201-205 units and sustained high volatility. Recent demand in Period 47 was 214 units, slightly above the long-term average of the current regime but well within the expected range. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message (ordered P_N, arrived P_N). Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. Since the backend base stock logic uses (1+L) * mu_hat, and L=0, I will set mu_hat to reflect the mean demand of the stable high-demand regime (Period 20 onwards). I am using recent_N=20 to capture this stable regime's mean and standard deviation accurately, ensuring the OR backend can accommodate the high volatility (sigma) seen in recent periods without over-ordering during the final periods of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting around Period 20. Excluding the outlier spike in Period 37 (369 units), the mean demand from Period 20 to Period 48 is approximately 201 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P44-P48), the average demand is 201.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.2, which aligns closely with the long-term stable high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use the recent_N method with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and variance effectively, providing a robust base stock that accounts for the observed volatility (sigma) while maintaining the 80% service level target (critical ratio implied by profit $4 and holding cost $1).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 203 units (excluding the Period 37 outlier). In the most recent 10-period window (P40-P49), the average is slightly lower at 188.4 units, but this includes a softer period from P40-P43. Recent demand (P47-P49) has returned to the 200-215 range. Since profit ($4) is much higher than holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, warranting a healthy safety stock to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the stable high-demand regime since P20, which provides a robust estimate of both mean and volatility (sigma) while smoothing out the P37 outlier better than a shorter window. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.
