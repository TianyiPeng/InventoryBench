This suggests the high-demand regime is stable but volatile. 3. OR Baseline Evaluation: The OR recommendation of 114 units is significantly too low. This is because the OR agent calculates the base-stock levels using the entire 32-period history (including the early low-demand periods), whereas the actual demand has doubled for nearly 20 periods. 4. Strategy: I will target a base stock level of approximately 215 units (reflecting the 90th percentile of the high-demand regime). With 79 units on-hand, an order of 136 would reach that level.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has historically exhibited significant regime shifts: an early baseline of ~95, a mid-game average of ~200, a brief spike to ~285, and a recent stabilization period. Over the last five periods (P44-P48), the average demand is approximately 201 units (241, 194, 149, 214, 208). The OR recommendation is 208 units, which aligns well with this recent average. Since the game is at Period 49 out of 50, I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover this period's demand without over-ordering for the final period (Period 50), although the cost of a stockout (Profit=$4) exceeds the holding cost (Holding=$1). Given the current on-hand inventory of 11, an order of 200 units provides a total availability of 211, which safely covers the recent average demand of ~201 while protecting against a modest spike.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 200 units to cover the current period's expected demand (avg ~201) while factoring in 11 units on-hand; this aligns closely with the OR recommendation and recent demand stability.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised and actual lead time for chips(Regular) is 0 periods, confirmed by consistent historical data. In Period 50, the current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Demand for the most recent 6 periods (P44-P49) has averaged 201 units, maintaining the stabilized high-demand regime identified earlier (around 200 units). The OR baseline recommends 209 units, which aligns well with the current demand average and the need to maintain a small safety buffer against volatility. Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), the goal is to maximize profit by meeting current demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Ordering 190-200 units would likely cover the demand while keeping ending inventory low, but following the OR recommendation of 209 is a safe, balanced approach given the 0-period lead time. I will slightly adjust the OR recommendation downward to 200 to better align with the recent 6-period mean and target a near-zero ending inventory for the final period.",
