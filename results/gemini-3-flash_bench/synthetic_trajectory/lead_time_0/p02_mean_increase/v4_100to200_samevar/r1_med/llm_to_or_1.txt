Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96. The average demand is approximately 91. The period 2 value (36) appears as a potential outlier or a low-demand event, but given the sample size is small (N=5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent history. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no recorded arrival data yet (only initial demand samples), I will use 'default' for L to start with the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to focus on the provided historical demand context. This provides a baseline forecast of (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the most recent 5 data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 62, which is lower than the initial historical average of 91. The order placed in Period 1 (118 units) arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Current on-hand inventory is 56. Given the historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) and the most recent observation (62), there is high variance but no clear regime shift yet. I will use the 'default' lead time (0) and a 'recent_N' approach for demand and volatility to capture the newest data point while still weighting previous samples. I'll set N=6 to include the five historical samples plus the Period 1 observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a significant stockout (sold 112 units vs demand 161) because the on-hand inventory was insufficient. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. Historical demand samples (P1: 105, P2: 36, P3: 108, P4: 110, P5: 96) suggest an average demand of approximately 91 units per period. However, the observed demand in the game so far was P1: 62 and P2: 161, averaging 111.5. Given the high volatility in the game observations compared to the provided samples, I will use recent_N to emphasize more recent trends. I will set N=2 (the total periods observed) to capture the higher demand level (111.5 avg) and significant variance (std deviation ~70). The base stock calculation in the OR backend uses profit/(profit + holding) which is 4/5 = 0.8 service level. Setting parameters to cover the current demand spike is critical to avoid further lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 3 periods, we observed demand of 62, 161, and 76. The demand sample for Period 2 (161) was significantly higher than the others, causing a stockout because the OR engine's cap (based on mean/std) was too low to cover the spike. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 4, the initial demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest a mean around 91. To prevent another stockout given the high variance (std ~28-30), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while allowing the OR backend to calculate the necessary safety stock. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data from Period 1 to 4 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrived the same period they were placed). Current demand observations (P1: 62, P2: 161, P3: 76, P4: 60) show significant volatility, with a notable spike in Period 2. The average demand across all periods is approximately 90 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable at 0. For the mean demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the recent performance equally. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high variance (standard deviation) caused by the Period 2 spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to avoid the stockout experienced in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on history (Periods 1-5), the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand samples provided for analysis are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], while the actual observed demands in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-5 are [62, 161, 76, 60, 64]. Comparing the samples provided in the prompt vs the actual environment feedback shows high volatility (e.g., Period 2 demand spiked to 161). The mean of the actual demand over 5 periods is 84.6. Given the consistency of same-period arrival (L=0), I will keep L at default. For mu_hat, considering the spike in Period 2 and the relatively stable recent 3 periods (76, 60, 64), I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution while smoothing the P2 spike. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the volatility seen in P2 to prevent stockouts if another spike occurs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant variability: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, and 111 (calculated from sales/demand in history). The average demand across these 6 periods is approximately 89 units. The most recent demand (Period 6) was 111, which is higher than the average, while Period 2 saw a peak of 161 causing a stockout. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and mean demand shift better than the full history, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*sigma covers the next period's demand (L=0). With 10 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend needs to place an order to replenish inventory to the calculated base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-7 confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but shows no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift over the first 7 periods. Based on the 7 samples from the game history (demands: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65), the mean is approximately 85.5 and the standard deviation is approximately 36. Since we are only at Period 8 and the signal for a shift is not yet sustained, I will use all available samples (N=7) to estimate demand. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline variance until a trend emerges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 123 vs supply 118), indicating that the backend estimate based on previous sample means (avg ~90-100) was too low for recent spikes. Historical demand shows high volatility: Period_1=105, Period_2=36, Period_3=108, Period_4=110, Period_5=96, P6=111, P7=65, P8=123 (excluding seed samples). The mean of the last 8 periods is ~90, but we need to account for the high variance and the stockout. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture current volatility while ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand shifts. The goal is to set a high enough base stock to prevent further stockouts given the relatively high profit margin ($4) compared to holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but no clear trend or seasonality over the first 9 periods. Demand samples are: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104. The mean is approximately 91.8. In Period 2 and Period 8, we stocked out due to demand spikes of 161 and 123 respectively. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, we have 18 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To avoid future stockouts, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the average demand including the spikes. I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed standard deviation across all samples to set a sufficient safety stock. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently higher than the initial seed data provided (mean of ~91 units), with observed demand mean over the first 10 periods being approximately 91.7 units. The last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a slightly higher average of 98.6 compared to the first 5 (84.6). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation targets only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). To ensure sufficient stock and minimize the risk of stockouts seen in Period 2 and Period 8 (where ending inventory was 0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full trajectory of the live game demand while allowing the backend to compute standard deviation for the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: mean demand over first 10 periods is ~91.7 units, higher than initial samples. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a mean of approximately 89.5 units over the first 11 periods (Total demand 985 / 11 periods), which is higher than the initial samples mean of ~91.0 if including the high Period 2 and 8 values. Recently, demand has fluctuated between 60 and 123. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the 11-period history, the mean is approximately 90 and the standard deviation is approximately 32. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for the current period (1+0). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized regime highlighted in the carry-over insights while allowing the OR backend to calculate the parameters based on the full game history observed so far.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 12 periods. The mean demand from the game history (P1-P12) is 89.4 units, which is consistent with the Carry-Over Insight from Period 11 (~91.7). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Calculation of parameters: mean demand (last 12 periods) is 89.42, standard deviation is ~32.4. Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, giving a critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Since lead time is 0 (L=0), mu_hat represents demand for 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full game history mean and variance while discounting the initial pre-game samples which appeared higher (mean ~91).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1, with a mean demand over the first 13 periods of approximately 90.7 units. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 91.4 units, confirming stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 10 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full observed history after the initial samples, as the demand regime has been consistent. For lead time, I will use 'default' since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-14) shows a mean of approximately 93.2 units, which is higher than the initial provided samples (avg ~91). In Period 14, demand spiked to 140, causing a stockout. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the most recent 14 periods of history to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the currently active demand regime more accurately than the long-term history which includes seed data. Since lead time is 0, the review period is essentially just the current period (L+1=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased recently, with a major spike in Period 14 (140 units) leading to a stockout. Observed lead time remains strictly 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand remained high at 99 units, following the significant spike in Period 14 (140 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 100.2 units, which is notably higher than the long-term average of ~91.7. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods across all 15 conclude messages. To capture this recent sustained higher demand while accounting for the increased volatility evidenced by the Period 14 stockout, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since L=0, mu_hat becomes (1+0) * mean(P11-P15), which is approximately 100.2. This ensures we maintain a base stock high enough to satisfy current demand trends and prevent stockouts while the OR backend logic balances the holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Sustained demand increase confirmed (P11-P15 avg: 100.2 units vs P1-P10 avg: 91.7 units). Demand volatility remains elevated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike of 227 units, which is significantly higher than any previous observation (previous max was 140-161). This resulted in a complete stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 123). Combined with the previous carry-over insight that average demand had already stepped up to ~100 units, this new outlier suggests a high-volatility regime or a major shift in demand scale. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging this extreme spike, I will use a shorter window (Recent N=6) to capture the trend of P11-P16 (averaging ~121 units) and adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. However, since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy and Period 16 was a massive outlier (227), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a slightly more aggressive buffer, while letting recent_N for sigma capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Extreme demand spike observed (227 units), leading to stockout. P11-P16 average demand risen to ~121.7 units (from ~91.7 in P1-P10). High volatility confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift and extremely high volatility. In Period 16, demand spiked to 227 units, and in Period 17, it was 186 units, both exceeding the supply and resulting in stockouts (ending on-hand inventory = 0). Since the lead time is consistently 0 (the order placed at the start of the period arrives during the same period to meet that period's demand), we need to ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are high enough to cover these larger spikes. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is approximately 163 units, which is much higher than the historical average. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility and prevent further stockouts. L is set to default as the lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: P14-P17 average demand is ~163 units, representing a secondary spike beyond the P11-P16 shift. Volatility is at its highest recorded level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $840.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Demand has shifted significantly over the last 5 periods: Period 14 (140), Period 15 (99), Period 16 (227), Period 17 (186), and Period 18 (210). The average demand over these last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 172.4 units, with the last three periods specifically averaging 207.6 units. We have experienced three consecutive periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (Periods 16, 17, and 18) because our inventory levels were insufficient to meet this high-demand regime. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To maximize profit and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this high-demand state (target mean ~200) and using a high recent_N for sigma to account for the extreme volatility observed (e.g., the jump to 227 in P16). Given L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*expected_demand. I will set mu_hat to 205 to capture the high recent volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: High-demand regime confirmed (P16-P18 average: 207.7 units). This is a sustained +70% increase over the P11-P15 average of 121.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $605.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. History shows a progression: P1-P10 (avg ~92), P11-P15 (avg ~100), and P16-P19 (avg ~198.5). Specifically, the last four periods recorded demands of 227, 186, 210, and 171. Despite the drop to 171 in P19, the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) is 198.5, which is more representative of the current high-demand state than the long-term average. Lead time is consistently 0 (the order arrives in the same period it is placed). Therefore, L is set to 0. To capture the recent high volume while respecting the volatility seen in the 227 and 210 peaks, I will use the last 4 periods (P16-P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current 'high' regime (approx. 200 units) while the service level logic (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) manages the holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P19) confirmed: average demand is 198.5 units, a ~100% increase over the P1-P15 baseline. Volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 25.5 in this window).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. In the most recent window (Periods 16-20), the demand values were 227, 186, 210, 171, and 209, resulting in a mean of 200.6 units and a standard deviation of 22.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every recorded transaction in the game history. To capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while ensuring we recover from recent inventory depletions (on-hand is currently only 11 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (the current regime length). The base stock calculation in the backend (profit=4, holding=1, q=0.8) will naturally target a high service level to minimize lost sales during this peak period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a significantly higher level starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 21 is approximately 198.3 units (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187). Currently, we are in Period 22 with an on-hand inventory of 33 units and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture this high-demand regime and its associated volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to reflect the demand patterns observed since Period 16. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current high-demand, high-volatility environment (mean ~198, std ~20), ensuring we order enough to meet demand while considering the stockouts that occurred in Periods 16, 17, and 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~198 units since Period 16 (P16-P21 average: 198.3). Volatility remains significant with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8 during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $649.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level than the initial simulation periods. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 197 units (P16-P22: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173). While the most recent three periods (P20-P22) show a slight cooling (avg 189.7), the overall regime since P16 remains the most relevant for current decision-making. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime (covering Periods 16 through 22). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the +100% shift from the early-game baseline and provides enough buffer to avoid the stockouts observed in P16-P18.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. In the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged 196.0 units (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history. Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), requiring an order to meet the immediate demand in Period 24. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (average ~196, std dev ~18.6) while ignoring the lower historical baseline. This approach ensures the base stock calculation, which uses a 0.8 service level (4/(4+1)), sufficiently covers the expected demand plus a safety margin to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 16-18.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 16. In the window from Period 16 to Period 24, the average demand is approximately 193 units, with a standard deviation of about 24.5. The most recent demand at Period 24 was 158 units, which is lower than the recent average but still within the high-demand regime compared to the baseline of P1-P15. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. I am setting L=0 (explicitly to confirm recent history), mu_hat based on the last 9 samples (P16-P24) to capture the high-demand mean, and sigma_hat also based on the last 9 samples to account for current volatility. This configuration ensures the base stock reflects the current consumer behavior while the cap protects against over-stocking during slight dips like Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P24): Mean demand ~193 units, Standard Deviation ~24.5 units, Lead Time = 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a significantly higher mean compared to the initial periods. Since Period 16, the demand mean is approximately 190.5 units (P16-P25: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205, 158, 184). The standard deviation in this high-demand window is approximately 21.5 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, which simplifies the inventory coverage to the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). To capture this stabilized high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=10, covering most of the high-demand period from P16 to P25. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns and high volatility while avoiding the diluting effect of earlier, lower-demand data.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent period (Period 26), demand was 219 units, leading to a stockout. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean is approximately 193.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 25.0. I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture this stable high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. My parameters aim to cover the high demand levels while accounting for the significant volatility observed in the latter half of the game history, ensuring the inventory level is robust against demand spikes like those seen in P16 and P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at the 'high-demand' level established around Period 16. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 27 (12 samples), the mean demand is approximately 194.1 units. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 23.5. Recent demand in Periods 26 and 27 (219 and 200 units) aligns with this regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L = 0. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for the current volatility, aiming for a service level that balances the $4 profit and $1 holding cost (critical ratio = 0.8).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable in the high-demand state since Period 16. In the most recent 13 periods (P16-P28), demand has averaged approximately 195.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.3 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For Period 29, I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this stable high-demand regime for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. Using N=13 covers the entire period since the last major regime shift (Period 16), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for current consumption levels while ignoring the lower demand data from the first 15 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability reaffirmed for P16-P28: Mean ~195, Std Dev ~22. Lead time remains 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~191.7 units since Period 16 (P16-P29). The most recent demand in Period 29 was 211 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, which means orders arrive and are available for sale within the same period they are placed. To account for the recent stabilized demand regime (P16 onwards) while responding to the high volatility (Std Dev ~24.5), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14. This N-value covers the entirety of the high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Using 'default' for L (promised lead time of 0) remains appropriate given the historical evidence.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 through Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 195.5 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 21.0. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 30 where demand (223) exceeded starting on-hand (212). To maximize profit (4.0) while minimizing holding costs (1.0), the OR backend's service level target (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.8. I will utilize a recent_N approach (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (P16-P30), while keeping lead time calculation automatic given the stable 0-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the high-demand state (P16-P30): Mean ~196, Std Dev ~21. Stockout occurred in Period 30 due to demand spike (223).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 through Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 194.5 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 21.6 units, reflecting significant volatility including several stockout events (P16, P17, P18, P26, P29, P30) where demand met or exceeded inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize lost sales while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation, specifically focusing on the last 16 periods (P16-P31) to capture the current high-demand regime characteristics. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 194.5 unit mean plus a safety buffer for the documented volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 in a high-demand state. For the window P16-P32 (17 periods), the mean demand is approximately 196 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, satisfying demand after arrival. However, recent stockouts in Period 30 and Period 32 (where demand was 223 and 214 respectively) indicate that the current base stock calculation may be slightly too lean to handle upper-tail demand spikes. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 to capture this specific regime's characteristics. This should provide sufficient inventory to meet higher-than-average demand while maintaining the target service level dictated by the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P16-P32: Mean ~196 units, Std Dev ~21. Lead time remains 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, following a significant upward shift. Looking at the data from Period 16 to Period 33 (18 samples), the mean demand is approximately 194.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show an actual lead time of 0. Currently, we have 44 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. This will allow the backend to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the observed mean and variance, effectively balancing the risk of stockouts (which have occurred frequently when demand spikes above 210) against holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent period (P34), demand spiked to 237 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The average demand from Period 16 to Period 34 is approximately 196.4 units with a standard deviation of about 22.8. Given the high criticality of stockouts (profit $4 vs holding cost $1, implying a target service level of 80%), and the recent peak, I will use the last 19 periods (since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its 'high' state since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 196 units and a standard deviation of 21 units. However, we have observed several stockouts (P16, P17, P18, P26, P29, P30, P32, P34), often triggered by demand spikes exceeding 210 units (e.g., 237 in P34, 223 in P30, 227 in P16). The most recent demand was 199. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better handle these frequent spikes and minimize stockouts, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for both mean and volatility, focusing on the current stable regime (N=20, covering Period 16 to 35). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the observed high-variance environment while responding to the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 36, the mean demand is approximately 197.8 units with a standard deviation of about 23.4. In the most recent periods (P34-P36), we've seen spikes up to 237 units, which led to stockouts in Periods 34 and 36 because the on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the upside volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To minimize lost sales while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a service level around 80% is targeted by the backend's logic. I will use the last 21 samples (from Period 16 onwards) to capture this stable but high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend uses a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the current average and the significant spread, helping to buffer against the frequent ~230+ unit spikes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-state established around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent window (Periods 16-37), the mean demand is approximately 197.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. In the very recent periods (P34-P37), we've seen spikes of 237, 199, 237, and 208, suggesting a slight uptick in both mean and volatility compared to the earlier parts of this regime. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 0.80. My parameters reflect this recent stability while accounting for the high volatility that has caused several stockouts (P34, P36). I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the full high-demand regime since P16 for both mu and sigma, which accurately reflects the current mean (~198) and volatility (~23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $831.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 38, the mean demand is approximately 200.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the beginning of the simulation. For Period 39, I will use the recent_N method with N=23 (covering the period since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained high demand and volatility observe in this window. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that protects against demand spikes while managing inventory costs. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units, and with L=0, the order will arrive in time to meet this period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime (P16-P38) remains stable with mean ~200.2 units and Std Dev ~22.8 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high state since Period 16. Analyzing the window from P16 to P39 (24 periods), the mean demand is approximately 201.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods. In Period 39, we experienced a demand of 239 units, which exceeded our starting inventory (219), resulting in a stockout. This highlights the need for a slightly higher safety stock given the current volatility (standard deviation remains significant). I will use a recent_N method with N=24 to capture this entire stable high-demand regime for both mean and standard deviation calculations. The lead time will be set to use the 'calculate' method as it has been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P39) remains stable: mean ~201.2 units, Std Dev ~23.4 units. Lead time remains 0. High demand spikes (e.g., P39: 239 units) continue to cause occasional stockouts.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high-state since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of about 23. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by recent arrival data (orders placed in P40 arrived in P40). Period 39 saw a spike (239 units) and Period 40 demand was also high (217 units), leaving current on-hand inventory at 4 units. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will continue using the statistics from the stable high-demand regime (P16-P40, N=25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. Method 'recent_N' with N=25 is chosen to capture this entire stabilized regime while excluding the much lower demand from the first 15 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high-state since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201.2 units and a standard deviation of 23.4. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 214.9, indicating the baseline is slightly higher than the long-term high-regime average, or we are seeing more frequent high-side volatility. This high demand, combined with on-hand inventory ending at 0 in Period 41, necessitates setting the base stock to cover the expected demand for the current review period plus a safety margin. The lead time is verified at 0 through consistent historical arrivals. I will use a recent_N of 25 to capture the stable high-demand regime since Period 16 (41 - 16 = 25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculate to ensure the OR engine has enough samples to reflect the current mean and volatility correctly while minimizing stockout risk observed in Period 41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high-state since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of about 23 based on the most recent 25 periods (P16-P42). Recent performance shows persistent high demand (P39: 239, P40: 217, P41: 225) followed by a slight dip in P42 (170). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize the risk of stockouts during spikes while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=27 to capture the full length of the current high-demand regime. This provides a robust base for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained in a high-demand state since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P16 to P43), the mean demand is approximately 201.2 units with a standard deviation of 23.9 units. In the very recent periods (P39-P43), demand has spiked frequently (239, 217, 225, 170, 250), resulting in a stockout in Period 43 where demand (250) exceeded the starting on-hand (222). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.80. To prevent recurring stockouts during these high-demand spikes while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N window of 28 periods (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P43) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The zero lead time means we only need to cover the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime (P16-P43) remains stable but volatile, with a mean of ~201 units and Std Dev of ~24. Recurring stockouts (P41, P43) indicate that demand spikes frequently exceed 220 units.

Recurring stockouts (Periods 41, 43, 44) demonstrate that demand spikes frequently exceed the current inventory levels provided by the backend's default parameters. For Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a service level that covers demand spikes. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use the recent regime (P16-P44, N=29) to set the demand parameters, specifically targeting the mean and volatility observed during this stable period to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the recurring high-demand spikes near 235-250 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in its high-state since Period 16, but remains highly volatile. Analyzing recent data from Period 16 to Period 45: the mean demand is approximately 202 units with a standard deviation of about 24. Since Period 40, demand spikes have become more frequent (P41: 225, P43: 250, P44: 235), leading to three stockouts in the last five periods. To mitigate these stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=30 (covering the period from P16 to now). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level using the higher mean and volatility observed in this regime. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-45: Mean ~202, Std Dev ~24. Frequent demand spikes above 230 units (Periods 34, 36, 39, 43, 44) have caused multiple stockouts, suggesting a need for a slightly higher safety factor or more responsive volatility tracking.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 202 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~24). Constant stockouts in Periods 41, 43, 44, and nearly in 46 (ending inventory of 1) highlight that the upper tail of the demand distribution frequently reaches 230-250 units. With a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by all history) and a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the base stock should ideally cover the estimated mean demand plus a safety margin. Given the recent frequency of high-demand spikes (P43: 250, P44: 235, P46: 224), I am using a recent_N of 31 periods (representing the entire high-demand regime from P16 to P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while allowing the OR backend to apply the appropriate safety factor for the 80% service level target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $794.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a high mean demand of approximately 201 units and significant volatility (Std Dev ~24). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent delivery within the same period ordered. Recent periods show frequent spikes (e.g., P43: 250, P44: 235, P46: 224) that often lead to stockouts when starting inventory is near the mean. To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit: $4 vs Holding: $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=32 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P47) to capture the long-term stable mean and variance of this current state. A lead time of 0 is maintained using the 'explicit' method to reflect consistent historical performance and the current '0 period' promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $645.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201-202 units and high volatility (Std Dev ~24). In the most recent periods (P41-P48), we continue to see significant fluctuations ranging from 170 to 250 units, causing intermittent stockouts (P41, P43, P44). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 49, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 33 periods (P16-P48) to capture this sustained high-demand regime and its volatility accurately. With profit=4 and holding_cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a safety stock that covers about 80% of demand variability. Given the frequent spikes above 230, I am using recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to remain responsive to the most current behavior within the stable regime.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and significant volatility (Std Dev ~24). Current on-hand inventory is 63 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high criticality of stockouts observed in the history (recent stockouts in Periods 41, 43, 44), I am maintaining the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on this stable but high-demand regime from P16 onwards (N=34). The OR backend uses a service level based on profit/holding cost, and with lead time 0, it targets covering the distribution of a single period's demand to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs.
