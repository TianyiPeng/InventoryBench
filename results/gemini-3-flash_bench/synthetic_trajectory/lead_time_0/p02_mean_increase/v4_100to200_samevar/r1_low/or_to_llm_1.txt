  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first, an increase from ~90 to ~185 at Period 14, and then a further increase to ~222 units since Period 34. The most recent three periods (P45-P47) had demands of 190, 224, and 204 (average 206), while the OR recommendation of 135 units is significantly undershooting this new reality because it averages all 47 periods of historical data equally. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 27 and a target inventory level to satisfy ~210 units plus a small safety buffer, I need to order enough to reach approximately 240 units total. Subtracting the on-hand 27 gives an order of 213 units. This ensures we don't stock out given the sustained high demand regime.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, which history confirms (e.g., Period 48 order arrived in Period 48). Total periods in the game are 50, so this order for Period 49 is the penultimate decision. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Recent demand (P34-P48) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 213 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline or the OR algorithm's sample-weighted average. The OR recommendation of 97 units is insufficient because it heavily weights early low-demand periods (P1-P13), leading to a base-stock level that would cause a stockout against the current regime of ~210 units. To cover Period 49's expected demand (avg ~213) with 66 units on hand, I need at least 147 units. Given that this is near the end of the game and there is a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), I aim to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will order 150 units to meet the current demand regime and avoid a stockout in this final high-reward period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 97 to 150 units because the OR baseline is lagging significantly behind the current high-demand regime of ~213 units; 150 units plus 66 on-hand ensures coverage for the expected period demand.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent two significant shifts: first at Period 14 (increasing to ~185 units) and again at Period 34 (increasing to ~221 units). Recently, demand has shown high variability (ranging from 169 to 250 units over the last 10 periods). The OR recommendation of 116 units is heavily skewed by the lower demand data from the first half of the simulation (Periods 1-13) and does not reflect the current demand regime. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a safe inventory level against the current mean demand (~220 units) and recent volatility, I need to ensure the total available stock (on-hand + new order) covers the next period's expected peak demand. Ending inventory is 47. Ordering 210 units brings total availability to 257, which covers the recent historical peak demand of 250 (Period 43) while minimizing excessive holding costs as the game concludes.",
