Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a high relative holding cost (Holding=$1.0, Profit=$1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This means we should avoid overstocking. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Historical demand over the first 5 samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) shows a mean of 91 and an outlier in Period 2 (36). Given the lack of specific calendar date information beyond 'Period_1', I will use the mean of the available samples as a baseline. Since lead time is 0, the relevant demand window is (L+1) = 1 period. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture the global statistics of the 5 provided history samples, and use 'default' for L since no lead time deviations are yet observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 91 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Starting on-hand for Period 2 is 29 units. Historical demand for the 5 provided samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) shows a mean of 91. Period 1's actual demand was 62, which is slightly lower than the average but within the historical range. Since we only have one period of live data (Period 1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to stay responsive to the latest signals while acknowledging the small sample size. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 0.5), making accurate mu_hat critical to avoid overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 62. In Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 161, leading to a stockout (sold 90, 71 units demand lost). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same periods). Total units on hand is currently 0 with 0 in-transit because the Period 2 order was already consumed. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) show high variance. Given the stockout in P2 and the volatile demand, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging the 0-period lead time. I'll use N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent high demand and stockout more heavily in the OR calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 all arrived within the same period). Demand shows significant volatility: P1 (62), P2 (161), P3 (76). The provided historical sample data (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) appears to be pre-game data or a different distribution than the observed game demand. In P2, we experienced a stockout (sold 90 vs demand 161), indicating the need for a higher service level or more responsive forecasting. Given the high volatility and the stockout in P2, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the game's actual demand distribution (Mean: 99.6, Std Dev: 53.8) more accurately than the long-term historical mean. I will set L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 0, and the observed lead time in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 has consistently been 0. Demand for the first four periods has been 62, 161, 76, and 60 respectively (sample data provided in instruction lists demand slightly differently but history takes precedence). The sample mean is approximately 89.75 with a standard deviation of roughly 47.9. Current on-hand inventory is 40. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should be the median of the demand distribution (z* = 0). For Period 5, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the volatility (especially the spike in P2) while keeping L at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been: 62, 161 (likely an outlier or spike), 76, 60, and 64. The mean of these 5 samples is 84.6. However, the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' (Periods 1-5: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96) in the prompt contradicts the 'GAME HISTORY' logs (62, 161, 76, 60, 64). I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY logs as they reflect the actual inventory outcomes. Excluding the outlier of 161, the average demand is 65.5. Including it, the average is 84.6. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should be the median. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and lead time to capture the current environment. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to balance the recent stability with the early volatility seen in Period 2.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (demand was 111, but only 85 available). Historically, demand has been volatile, ranging from 60 to 161. The average demand across all 6 periods is 89, but looking at the most recent 3 periods (60, 64, 111), the average is 78.3. However, given the significant stockouts in Period 2 and Period 6 when demand spiked, I will set mu_hat more conservatively. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To better handle volatility and captured missed demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to react to the more recent variance patterns while acknowledging the 0-lead time capability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical analysis of Periods 1-7 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods (all orders arrived within same period). Demand shows high volatility, ranging from 60 to 161. Specifically, Period 2 (161) and Period 6 (111) significantly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts. The latest demand (Period 7) was 65. Given the high variance and the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's cap logic and base-stock formula will adjust this), I will use the most recent 7 periods of demand samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the high-demand spikes seen in Periods 2 and 6 while accounting for the lower demand seen in other periods. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data from Periods 1-8 confirms the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period). Consequently, pipeline inventory is zero at the start of each decision cycle. Looking at the demand history, there is high volatility: 62 (P1), 161 (P2), 76 (P3), 60 (P4), 64 (P5), 111 (P6), 65 (P7), and 123 (P8). The mean demand over 8 periods is approximately 90.25 units with a high standard deviation (approx 36.6). Recently, demand has shown a 'yo-yo' pattern (low then very high). Stockouts occurred in Periods 2, 6, and 8 because demand exceeded the on-hand inventory + current arrival. Since L=0, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which means the backend calculates z* = 0. However, the system's capping mechanism uses a 0.95 service level for the cap. Given the recent high spikes (111, 123) and the risk of lost sales (stockouts already occurred 3 times), I will use the last 5 samples to capture the recent high volatility while keeping L at its promised value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility and higher peaks recently, with demand in three of the last four periods (Periods 6, 8, 9) exceeding 100 units (111, 123, and 104 respectively), leading to stockouts because the OR backend's default base-stock logic didn't account for these spikes. Even though the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the current demand regime (last 4 periods) has a mean of approximately 100.5 units, significantly higher than the initial seed data. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($1/unit vs $1/unit holding cost implies a 50% critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime. I will keep L at default since arrivals are consistently occurring within the same period (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: Mean demand increased from ~65 to ~100 with higher variance, causing frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher mean regime starting at Period 6. Historical demand from P6 to P10 shows values of 111, 65, 123, 104, and 91, resulting in a mean of 98.8. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. Since the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met as evidenced by the 'arrived' information in the history (lead_time was 0 periods for all orders), I will maintain the default lead time setting. To responsive to the new demand levels and high volatility which led to stockouts in periods 6, 8, and 9, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the new mean of ~99 and the increased variance of this regime better than using the whole history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that began around Period 6. From P1-P5, demand mean was ~65. From P6-P11, demand has been much higher and more volatile: 111, 65, 123, 104, 91, 68 (mean ~94). The stockout events in P6, P8, and P9 indicate that the previous baseline was insufficient for this new level of demand. I am selecting a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-variance regime since Period 6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will stick with the default lead time setting.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~65 to nearly ~100. Over the last 7 periods (P6-P12), average demand has been approximately 93 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (6 units) with 0 in-transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 6-12) where demand increased and became more volatile, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods of this regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 6. From Period 1-5, mean demand was ~65. From Period 6-13, mean demand increased to ~102, with significant volatility (highs of 123, lows of 65) and frequent stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in 4 out of the last 8 periods). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the post-shift mean and variance, which covers the current regime. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these last 8 samples (Periods 6-13) will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that better covers the increased demand and high variance, aiming to reduce the stockouts observed in Periods 6, 8, 9, and 13.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 6. Since then (Periods 6-14), demand has averaged approximately 99 units with several peaks exceeding 120 (max 140). The product has frequently stocked out (Periods 6, 8, 9, 13, 14), indicating the previous inventory targets were too low despite a consistent lead time of 0. Currently, On-hand and In-transit are zero. I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this higher demand regime. Using recent_N=9 covers the data from Period 6 to Period 14 (regime length = 9), which accurately reflects the current mean and volatility. L remains 0 based on consistent history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from an average of ~65 to ~100. Over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the mean demand is 99 with a standard deviation of approximately 24. We have experienced several stockouts (ending inventory 0 in Periods 6, 8, 9, 13, 14), indicating our supply is periodically failing to meet demand spikes. The current inventory is nearly empty (1 unit). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward given equal profit and holding costs, we aim for a 50% service level base stock, but since we are frequently stocking out for a product with no lead time and high variance, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher demand mean (99) and variance of this current regime. Setting mu_hat to the expected demand of 99 and sigma_hat to the recent historical volatility will allow the OR engine to better satisfy the current demand level while accounting for the high holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend and increased volatility. Since Period 6, the mean demand shifted from ~70 to over 100, and Period 16 saw a massive spike to 227, leading to a stockout. My objective is to prevent frequent stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $1.0 profit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the regime since Period 6) to capture the higher mean and variance observed in this new phase. By setting N=11, I include the recent spike but smooth its extreme impact slightly so as not to over-order if it was an isolated outlier, while still significantly raising the base stock level to protect against the higher observed average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 16 (demand: 227), suggesting a potential second regime shift or extreme peak within the existing high-demand regime starting Period 6.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 18. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand patterns show two major shifts. Initially (P1-P5), demand averaged ~65. Starting P6, it shifted to a higher mean of ~100. Most recently, starting P16, demand has spiked significantly (P16: 227, P17: 186), with an average over these two periods of 206.5. This indicates a high-demand regime or seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts (sold units have been capped by available inventory in P13, P14, P16, and P17), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent surge (P15-P17) while balancing across the transition. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: P16-P17 demand (avg 206.5) is more than double the P6-P15 mean (~100), requiring aggressive inventory positioning.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' in the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 227, 186, and 210, resulting in an average of approximately 207.7 units per period. Despite aggressive ordering, we have stocked out in all three periods because the base stock calculation, which is throttled by the OR engine's internal cap and historical statistics, has not yet fully adapted to this shift. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all 18 historical conclude messages. To maximize profit and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent surge (P16-P18) while ignoring the lower demand periods (P1-P15). I set L to 'default' as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant shift to a higher-demand regime starting at Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) was 227, 186, 210, and 171, respectively, averaging 198.5 units. This is a dramatic increase from the ~100 unit average observed from P6-P15. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new regime (calculated by the backend as (1+L) * 198.5). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). By setting mu_hat to the mean of this high-demand period, we target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to localise volatility for this specific regime and avoid underestimating variance during this peak.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) has been 227, 186, 210, 171, and 209, resulting in a mean of approximately 201. This is a significant jump from the previous regime (P6-P15) where the mean was around 100. Despite substantial orders, we are frequently hitting zero ending inventory (stocking out), indicating that we are meeting demand but not carrying enough safety stock to handle the increased volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this new elevated mean of ~201 (multiplied by 1+L=1), and use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to adjust for the higher volatility seen in this period (standard deviation is roughly 21). This will allow the OR engine to stock at a level that better protects against stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16-P21), the demand has stabilized at a much higher level compared to the initial periods. The mean demand for these last 6 periods is approximately 198 (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187), whereas the previous regime (P6-P15) was around 100. Observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the High-Profit/High-Holding cost balance (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the backend OR logic will target a service level of 0.50 (z=0). To react to the current sustained high-demand regime while maintaining some buffer for volatility (Standard Deviation since P16 is approx 19), I will set N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the parameters reflect the current 'High' regime (Periods 16-21) without being diluted by the lower-demand history of previous periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 22, the average is approximately 194.7 units per period (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173). Despite the high volume, the variance within this specific window has decreased relative to the initial shock. On-hand inventory is currently low (26 units) with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 to capture this most recent stable high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover this elevated demand while accounting for the current stock level.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16-P23), the mean demand is approximately 196 units (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period in the history. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because the OR backend's capped policy is likely under-ordering due to the inclusion of the early low-demand data (P1-P5 were ~100, P6-P15 were ~100 with shift, P16+ is ~200). To bridge this gap, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture only this most recent high-demand regime (P16-P23). This will raise the base stock level to match the current demand of ~200 per period. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the engine targets the median demand; however, given the high volatility and stockout history, focusing on the recent N samples is the most responsive way to ensure availability without excessive overstock.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24 (9 samples), the mean demand is 191.7, which is significantly higher than the previous regime (~100). The recent demand values are: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205, 158. Period 24 demand (158) is slightly lower but fits within the high-variance nature of this regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (the 'conclude' messages show orders placed and arriving in the same period). Given that the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, the ideal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain lead time at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P24): Mean demand is ~192 with significant volatility, compared to the previous regime of ~100.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 191 units per period. The critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock level should target the mean of the review+lead period (1+L). Since lead time is consistently 0, the target inventory is simply the expected demand for the current period. I am using recent_N with N=10 to capture only this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Although the z-score is 0 (canceling the sigma_hat term in the base stock formula), providing an accurate sigma_hat for the most recent regime remains best practice for the OR engine's internal capping logic.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) remains active, characterized by a significantly higher mean (approx. 192) and increased volatility compared to earlier periods. Period 26 demand was 219, leading to a stockout. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying target service level (q) = 0.5; however, the OR backend's safety stock calculation and cap are conservative. To prevent recurring stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am using recent_N (N=11, covering the current regime P16-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the high-demand regime identified around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P16-P27), the mean demand is approximately 194.2 with a standard deviation of roughly 20.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (order and arrival occur in the same period). In Period 27, demand (200) slightly exceeded the arriving stock (194), resulting in a stockout. To minimize the risk of lost sales while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 creates a 0.5 critical ratio, but the OR backend capped policy and high demand volatility suggest target service levels should remain robust), I am using N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire high-demand regime (P16-P27) to provide a stable forecast against the observed volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 data points), the mean demand is approximately 194 units per period (sum=2529), with a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 15 units. To ensure we capture the demand for Period 29 (which occurs after our decision), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 to specifically target this current regime while providing enough data points for a stable estimate. Setting L to 'default' as lead time is consistently 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 29, the mean demand is approximately 196.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. There is no evidence of a lead time shift; all orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, including the most recent update in Period 29. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median (\u03bc\u0302). However, the OR backend's capping mechanism and the tendency to stock out in recent periods (ending inventory was 0 in 4 of the last 10 periods) suggest that we should ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calibrated to the most recent regime. Using recent_N with N=14 (from P16 to P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-activity period while ignoring the lower-demand history prior to Period 16.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the high-demand regime established in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 30 (15 samples), the mean demand is approximately 196.6 with a standard deviation of 19.8. Recent periods (P26-P30) show a slightly higher average of ~206, reinforcing the need for aggressive stock levels. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with observed history, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are used to satisfy today's demand. To maximize reward, I must account for the high cost of lost sales (Profit=$1 vs. Holding=$1, implying a 50% service level target in a simple Newsboy model, but the OR engine's base-stock logic with lead-time adjustment requires robust estimates). I will use the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the 'calculate' method for L as lead times have been stable at 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 195 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 20 units. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 174, following a peak of 223 in Period 30. There are no signs of upcoming seasonality or further regime shifts in the immediate historical data. Lead time has consistently resided at 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in the history. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula will target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period performance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In this current regime (P16-P32), the average demand is approximately 196 units with a standard deviation of about 20. Lead times have remained consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Despite the high demand, ending inventories frequently hit zero or near-zero, indicating that the OR backend's cap or the calculated base stock might be slightly lower than required to fully capture peak demand (which has hit as high as 227). Using recent_N with N=17 (covering P16 to P32) will allow the backend to use the mean and variance specific to this high-demand period. Since the critical service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, the OR policy targets the median. Given the frequent stockouts, I will use recent_N to ensure the backend is responsive to the current 196-unit average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 25-33), the mean demand is approximately 197 units per period with a standard deviation of about 20. The current on-hand inventory is low (26 units) and there are no units in transit. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend OR logic will order to reach the base stock level within the same period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the mean and variance of this current stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest patterns without being diluted by the lower demand seen earlier in the game. Method 'default' for L is appropriate as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 34, the mean is approximately 196.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 22.5. Currently, we are at Period 35 with zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit inventory, meaning we have missed the opportunity for Period 35's arrival if lead time is 0. However, consistent with a lead time of 0, the order placed in Period 35 will arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (N=19) to capture this specific regime. Using N=19 covers the data from P16 to P34. Lead time L is set to default (0), as history consistently shows same-period arrivals (lead_time was 0 periods).

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the 20 periods from P16 to P35, the mean demand is approximately 196.8 with a standard deviation of 23.9. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time observed in history is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period. However, we have experienced frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 13 out of the last 20 periods), indicating the system's 'cap' or the OR engine's default variance handling is slightly underestimating the upper tail of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean (approx 197) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current volatility (approx 24). Setting L=0 explicitly as it is consistently confirmed. This should maintain a high service level while minimizing lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (P16-P35): Mean demand ~197, Std Dev ~24. Frequent stockouts suggest demand is often exceeding current base stock levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 198 and a standard deviation of about 24. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory = 0 in Periods 34, 35, and 36) indicate that the current ordering strategy is slightly under-catering to peak demand periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend targets via the base stock policy. However, given the zero ending inventory in recent periods, I will use the established regime (P16-P36) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P36 order arrived P36). I choose recent_N with N=21 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime since Period 16.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 197 units and significant volatility. The current status shows on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, following another stockout in Period 37 where demand (208) exceeded our starting inventory (199). With a promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by past 'conclude' messages (actual lead time = 0), we must ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover this period's demand. Given the frequent stockouts and the high demand volatility (std dev ~24), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=22 to cover the regime from P16) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to set a higher buffer. Setting sigma_hat to 35 provides a safer margin than the recent period standard deviation to prevent lost sales in this zero-inventory state.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 197.8 units and a standard deviation around 23 units. In recent periods (P34-P38), demand has frequently peaked at or above 210 units (P34: 237, P36: 237, P37: 208, P38: 210), leading to repeated stockouts because current base stock levels are barely covering the mean. The promised lead time remains 0, and consistent same-period arrivals (L=0) are confirmed by the history. To prevent further lost sales in this 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio environment (where the target service level is 50%, but stockouts indicate demand is consistently on the right tail of our forecast), I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the start of this regime at P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we capture the full variance of the current regime while reacting to the sustained higher mean compared to early-game data.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory status shows 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, following a consistent pattern where demand exceeds the supply provided by the OR backend's capped policy (we sold 200 units but demand was 239). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The demand regime from Period 16 onwards (24 samples) has a mean of approximately 201 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has shifted higher: 199, 237, 208, 210, 239 (Mean = 218.6). To mitigate the persistent stockouts and address this recent upward trend, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this newest demand level. I will use a larger N (24) for sigma_hat to maintain a stable volatility estimate across the high-demand regime, ensuring the service level target is met without excessive over-ordering, while L remains at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 36: Mean demand increased from ~195 to ~218 (+12%), causing continued stockouts as the previous base stock was insufficient.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent shift starting around Period 36. Since Period 36, demand has consistently exceeded 200 units (averaging approximately 222 units over the last 5 periods: 237, 208, 210, 239, 217). The current base stock levels have been barely sufficient, often resulting in stockouts or near-stockouts (on-hand inventory at the end of Period 40 was only 2 units). The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) imply a critical ratio of 0.5, but given the volatility and the frequency of stockouts in this high-demand regime, a slightly more robust safety stock is necessary to capture lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the current Period 36+ regime (which has now lasted 5 periods) and ensure the OR backend reacts to the sustained increase in both mean and variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 confirmed as highest yet: Mean demand P36-P40 is ~222 units, compared to ~197 in P16-P35. Volatility remains high, requiring frequent replenishment.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a new high-demand regime that began around Period 36. Examining the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand values are [237, 208, 210, 239, 217, 225], resulting in a mean of approximately 222.6 and a standard deviation of 12.8. In Period 41, we stocked out again (sold 223 against a demand of 225), indicating that current inventory targets are still slightly too low to capture peak demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts in this high-demand phase, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the dynamics of this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time method as the promised lead time of 0 is reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in its highest observed regime, which began around Period 36. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 42, the mean demand is approximately 215 units (237, 208, 210, 239, 217, 225, 170). Although Period 42 showed a lower demand of 170, the preceding periods were consistently above 200, often exceeding 220. The current on-hand inventory is 53 units with zero in-transit. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history), the replenishment order arrives within the same period. For Period 43, I will set 'mu_hat' using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the Period 36-42 regime change) to capture this higher average demand while accounting for the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a level sufficient to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in earlier periods of this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent starting around Period 36. In this current regime (P36-P43), the mean demand is approximately 218.6 units with significant volatility (std dev ~24). In Period 43, we saw a record high demand of 250 units, which exhausted our inventory. A lead time of 0 is consistently observed. To prevent frequent stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility environment, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 8 periods (P36-P43) where the new higher mean is established. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 200+ demand level rather than older, lower historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 is sustained: Mean demand (P36-P43) is 218.6 units. Period 43 recorded a new high of 250 units, confirming that demand levels frequently exceed 220 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent beginning at Period 36. Since P36, the average demand is 218.6 units (samples: 237, 208, 210, 239, 217, 225, 170, 250, 235). The inventory frequently hits zero (9 out of the last 10 periods), indicating that the base stock level is consistently too low to absorb volatility. With Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, but because stockouts represent lost profit and potential reputational loss in a game sense, and current demand often exceeds 230, I will use recent_N (N=9, matching the start of the current regime) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to capture current high volatility (Std Dev approx 24.5). Lead time remains 0 based on consistent immediate arrivals (ordered Period N, arrived Period N).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 is highly volatile: mean 218.6, but peaks frequently occur at 235-250 units, making a higher safety stock necessary to avoid zero-inventory conclusions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the high-demand regime established at Period 36. Recent observations from P36 to P45 show a mean demand of approximately 218.1 units. While Period 45 demand was lower (190), the preceding periods (P43: 250, P44: 235) confirm that the system remains prone to high peaks. With on-hand inventory at 32 and a lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture this current regime's characteristics. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover these frequent surges while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the high-regime pattern established around Period 36, characterized by a mean of approximately 215-220 units but with frequent spikes reaching 235-250 units (e.g., P43: 250, P44: 235, P46: 224). The inventory at the start of Period 47 is 0, following a stockout in Period 46 where starting on-hand was 219 and demand was 224. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and frequent stockouts, I am using a recent_N of 11 (covering Period 36 to Period 46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This captures the most recent regime's characteristics (mean ~218) while accounting for the high volatility observed. Since L=0, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat essentially prepares us for the current period's demand. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the service level target is 50% for the OR backend calculation, but my choice of explicit recent_N parameters ensures we are tracking the actual high-demand shift regardless of the thin margin between profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 remains high and volatile (P36-P46 mean: 218.6); frequent demand spikes >220 units continue to cause stockouts when starting inventory is capped near the mean.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-demand regime that began around Period 36. The mean demand for the last 12 periods (P36-P47) is approximately 218 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 22 units. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), the inventory level at the start of the demand resolution phase is entirely determined by the current period's order and any leftover on-hand units. Recent periods (P41, P43, P44, P46) have shown several stockouts because the starting inventory (governed by the OR base stock logic) was slightly too low relative to peak demands of 225-250. To mitigate this risk while respecting the cost structure (Profit=1, Holding=1 suggests a target service level of 50%, but the backend cap is higher), I will use an N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-regime behavior accurately. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been a reliable 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into its highest regime starting Period 36. Analyzing the 13 samples from P36 to P48, the mean demand is 218.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. In the most recent period (P48), demand was 174, slightly below average, leaving 44 units on hand. However, the regime frequently sees peaks above 235 units (P36, P39, P43, P44), and stockouts have occurred when starting inventory was set near the 218-220 range. Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, theoretically targeting the mean for the base stock. However, given the recurrent stockouts and the high volatility (sigma \u2248 23), I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast of 230 to provide a small buffer over the regime mean (218), ensuring we capture more of the frequent high-demand spikes while approaching the game's end at Period 50. This slightly higher mu_hat acts as a safety against the volatility observed in the P36-P48 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 36. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 49, the mean demand is approximately 211.3 units with a standard deviation of 27.2. Recent periods (P46-P49) show a slight softening in demand (169, 174, 204, 224), but the overall volatility remains high, with frequent peaks exceeding 230 units (e.g., P36, P39, P43, P44). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid the frequent stockouts observed in the history, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 14 periods (the current regime length since P36) to capture this specific mean and variance. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level while maintaining enough buffer for the observed spikes.
