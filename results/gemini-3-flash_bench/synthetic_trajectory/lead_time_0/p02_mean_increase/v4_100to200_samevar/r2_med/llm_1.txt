Historical demand data shows a range between 36 and 110 units, with an average of approximately 91 units across the five provided samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period (Period 1 conclude). To maximize profit while minimizing stockout risk, I need to cover the current period's demand immediately. I will target the higher end of the historical range (~110 units) to ensure high service level, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, favoring slightly higher inventory over stockouts.",
