Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), suggesting a mean of ~96.8 and a standard deviation of ~20. Since the promised lead time is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0, the OR engine needs to place an order immediately. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the system to calculate the baseline based on the provided historical samples and promised lead time. No significant patterns or lead time deviations have been observed yet as no periods have concluded.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 115 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), resulting in an ending inventory of 5 units after a demand of 110. The promised lead time is 0, and the observed lead time for the first period was indeed 0. Demand for the first period was significantly higher (110) than the sample provided for Period_1 (71), suggesting the provided historical data might be a prior or that we are seeing high initial demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture this latest demand level (110) for mu_hat, rather than averaging with the lower historical samples (avg=96.8), to avoid stockouts. L remains at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods because orders arrived in the same period they were placed. Demand in Period 1 was 110 (115 inventory, 110 sold, 5 left) and Period 2 was 145 (127 inventory, 127 sold, 0 left), both higher than the samples provided initially. I am experiencing stockouts (Period 2 sold only 127 units despite demand of 145). The current mean demand based on Period 1-5 samples provided and observed history is roughly 100-110 units. However, recent observations (110 and 145) suggest a higher trend. I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this recent spike and address the stockout risk, while maintaining the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stockout in Period 2 (sold 127 vs demand 145), indicating demand volatility. Historical demand samples (P1: 110, P2: 145, P3: 113) show a mean of ~122.6 and significant variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand profile (weighted towards the higher demand observed in P2) while maintaining a base-stock policy that accounts for the 0-period lead time (review context suggests L=0 implies immediate fulfillment before demand resolution). Using N=3 for sigma_hat ensures we account for the P2 demand spike in the safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 96.8 units over the first 5 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). While there is high volatility (std dev ~21), there is no clear sustained shift or seasonality visible yet. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 4 concluded orders (P1-P4). The current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Given a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q = 0.8, which translates to a service level targeting roughly 0.84 standard deviations (z-score) above the mean. I will use the 'default' method for lead time as the promised 0-period lead time is holding. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the 'default' method (all available samples) because the sample size is small (N=5) and no distinct regimes have been identified yet.

Daily Profit: $140.00, Daily Holding Cost: $89.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 5 observed periods. Historical demand mean is 99 units with a standard deviation of 19.8. However, looking at the demand trend (P1: 110, P2: 145, P3: 113, P4: 88, P5: 35), there is a significant downward trend in the last two periods. Specifically, the demand dropped to 35 in Period 5. Given the high on-hand inventory (89) relative to the most recent demand, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adjust for this apparent slowdown and avoid over-ordering, which would incur high holding costs ($1/unit). The backend OR formula (profit/(profit+holding)) results in an 80% service level target. Setting L=0 explicitly matches the observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1-6 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear regime shift yet, with a mean demand across all 6 periods of approximately 99.5. However, there has been significant variation (min 35, max 145). Current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), which is insufficient to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period. To prevent stockouts, I will set mu_hat based on the mean of all historical samples (approximately 100 per period, multiplied by (1+L)=1) and use the standard deviation of all samples to handle volatility. No new sustained patterns or missing shipments are detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable, as confirmed by all history (Periods 1-7). Demand shows some fluctuation but no clear sustained trend yet; average demand over the 7 periods is approximately 95.5 units. Specifically, recent demand across Periods 5-7 (35, 106, 72) averaged 71 units, while the initial 4 periods averaged 114 units. However, given the variance (35 up to 145), using a broader sample for mu_hat (N=7) and a more recent sample for volatility (N=4) ensures we don't over-inventory during small dips while remaining protected against spikes. With profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the service level target is high (80%), so maintaining sufficient base stock is prioritized.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently observed in every period from 1 to 8 (each order arrives in the same period it is placed). Demand has shown moderate volatility without a clear trend or regime shift. Historical demand samples: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (pre-game) and 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112 (game history). The mean demand over the 8 game periods is approximately 97.6 units. Since the lead time L=0, the base stock (mu + sigma) needs to cover ONLY the current period's demand (1+L=1). On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history confirms L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 8 samples of game history (recent_N with N=8) to capture the current demand distribution accurately while giving more weight to recent realizations than pre-game data, ensuring we replenish enough to avoid stockouts seen in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $379.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the history where every order from Period 1 to 9 arrived within the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 25 units. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period (110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112, 101). Demand in Period 5 (35) appears to be an outlier. Over the last 4 periods (P6-P9), the mean demand is 97.75. Since L=0, the order must cover demand for the current period (Review + Lead = 1 period). I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the overall average demand while weighting the full available history, as no definitive regime shift is detected despite the Period 5 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $481.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since the game began, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. Specifically, the mean demand over the first 10 periods is 100.3 units (110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112, 101, 121). Period 5 and Period 7 showed notable dips, but the overall trend appears stationary. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 10 concluded orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand's central tendency (100.3) and volatility. Since L=0, mu_hat will represent the demand for one period (1+0). With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level is q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that covers period 11 demand while accounting for present on-hand inventory (3 units).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 11 arriving within their respective decision periods. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant fluctuation but no sustained regime shift or identifiable seasonality based on the current data (Periods 1-11). Demand has ranged from 35 to 145, with a mean of approximately 97.2. Given the high stockout cost relative to holding cost (4:1 ratio), a service level of 80% is targeted by the backend default. Utilizing the 'calculate' method for lead time to reinforce the observed 0-period performance and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical variability while staying responsive to the 59 units currently on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows consistent fluctuations without a clear structural regime shift or seasonality. The historical demand mean over 12 periods is approximately 100.5 units (sum=1207/12). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 12 prior periods arriving in the same period they were ordered. Given the service level target (q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variability while smoothing over the last 10 periods (N=10) to avoid overreacting to the low demand in Period 11 or the high demand in Period 10. L remains 0 as per the consistent 'calculate' results.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, though Period 13 saw a stockout where sales were capped at the available inventory (115) while demand was 130. Averaging the demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13: 101, 121, 67, 107, 130) gives a mean of 105.2. Period 2 also had a stockout but was compensated for in later periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived within the same period). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need a standard base-stock calculation. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture recent volatility and the slight upward trend in the latest demand sample, while keeping lead time at the promised 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 14 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand has shown some volatility but no clear structural regime shift or seasonal pattern (avg demand P1-P5: 78.2, P6-P10: 102.4, P11-P14: 98.5). The overall mean demand is 93.36 with a standard deviation of 27.94. I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader historical context while allowing for local sensitivity. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, implying the backend will target roughly a 0.84 z-score. Current on-hand is 36, and there is no inventory in-transit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal patterns observed in the first 15 periods. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 98.67, and the lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time (L) as it correctly reflects the observed 0-period lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable average across the entire history. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=15. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation simplifies to protecting against demand within the current period. The OR backend's service level (based on profit/holding cost) will naturally handle the safety stock calculation to maximize reward.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the last 16 periods. Looking at the demand history, the mean demand is approximately 100 units per period (Mean of all: 100, Recent 5: 94.8, Recent 10: 94.9). There is no strong evidence of a significant regime shift or seasonal spike yet, although Period 2 and Period 13 saw higher demand spikes. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period), so L=0 is appropriate. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the slightly lower demand seen in the most recent periods (avg ~95) compared to the very early periods, while still maintaining a representative sample size. For sigma_hat, N=10 will also be used to capture recent volatility without over-reacting to individual spikes. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (80%), so the OR backend will set a base stock that covers expected demand plus a safety margin to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 2 and 13.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without strong seasonal indicators since the start. The average demand across all 17 periods is approximately 98.3, while the more recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower at 91.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high service level requirement (profit is $4.0 vs. $1.0 holding cost, implying a critical ratio of 0.80), I will use the recent 10-period average to capture the current demand level while maintaining enough buffer for variance. I'll stick with method 'calculate' for lead time as it has been perfectly consistent at 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-18) shows significant variability but no clear long-term shifting regime, though Period 18 saw a spike to 157. The inventory ended at 0 in Period 18, meaning we potentially lost sales. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). For Period 19, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=8) to capture the slightly higher and more volatile demand observed in recent weeks (Periods 11-18 avg ~101, but with high variance). Using recent_N helps the OR backend respond to the latest local mean and standard deviation, which is crucial given the high stockout in Period 18 and the high volatility of the 'chips' category. This ensures the base stock (target inventory) is high enough to accommodate spikes like those seen in P2, P13, and P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand has shown a recent upward trend: the mean demand over the first 15 periods was roughly 97 units, but the last 4 periods (P16-P19) have seen demand of 54, 92, 157, and 150 respectively. Specifically, the last two periods (P18, P19) had very high demand (avg 153.5), causing stockouts (ending inventory=0). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or a peak. To capture this recent increase while acknowledging the volatility, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent data (Periods 15-19: demand 93, 54, 92, 157, 150). This results in a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this elevated demand level and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase detected starting Period 18: demand jumped from a historical average ~97 to over 150 for two consecutive periods, causing immediate stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 and 19, demand surged to 157 and 150 respectively (well above the prior average of ~97), suggesting a shift to a high-demand regime. However, in Period 20 demand plummeted to 20, which is an outlier relative to both the prior average and the recent surge. I suspect the high demand in P18-P19 was a specific event or a trend that was briefly interrupted by a low outlier. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 (arriving same period), I will target a stock level that accounts for the higher volatility. To avoid over-reacting to the P20 outlier while acknowledging the P18-P19 spike, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (capturing the spike periods and the outlier). This provides a balanced forecast that is higher than the baseline but moderated by the recent low demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $636.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a significant spike in Periods 18-19 (~153 avg), Period 20 saw a sharp drop to 20, followed by a massive peak of 190 in Period 21. This indicates a high-variance environment, potentially driven by seasonal factors or late-period promotional activity. The system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the Period 21 stockout. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this heightened demand and volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (encompassing periods 18-21). This N=4 window captures the regime shift (avg demand ~129, std dev ~76) and ensures the OR backend sets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts in this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility confirmed: Period 20 (20 units) vs Period 21 (190 units). Avg demand since Period 18 is ~129 with very high standard deviation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 18) shows significant volatility with values of 157, 150, 20, 190, and 109. The average demand for this 5-period window is 125.2, significantly higher than the initial history of ~97. Although Period 20 was an anomaly low (20), Period 21 was an extreme peak (190), indicating that we are in a high-variance, high-demand state. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this new regime while buffering against the extreme variance observed in the last 5 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) and increase sigma_hat by using 'recent_N=5' to capture the high volatility (std dev) of this specific period. This ensures the base stock calculated (which uses z-score * sigma) is high enough to cover potential spikes like the 190 seen in Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that started around Period 18. Since then, demand has fluctuated significantly: 157, 150, 20, 190, 109, and most recently 88. The average demand since Period 18 is approximately 119, but the standard deviation is extremely high due to the erratic 20 vs 190 swing. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this entire high-volatility regime (Periods 18-23). The actual lead time consistently confirms as 0 periods. Using the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 ensures the OR backend factors in both the higher mean and the increased risk of stockout due to volatility. The current on-hand inventory of 93 units is healthy, but the system will likely place a modest order to maintain the base stock level against this volatile demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18 onwards) is characterized by high volatility and a higher mean compared to the initial 17 periods. Period 1-17 averaged ~95 units, while Period 18-24 averages ~119 units with significant spikes (157, 150, 190) and one deep trough (20). Current on-hand inventory is 50. Leading into Period 25, the demand has stabilized slightly over the last three periods (109, 88, 120), averaging 105.7. However, given the profit of $4 vs holding cost of $1, the high-service-level target (q = 0.8) remains appropriate. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the shift starting at Period 18. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this new regime. L remains at default (0 periods) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period they were placed.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a period of extreme volatility since Period 18. While the historical mean (P1-P17) was approximately 98, the demand from P18-P25 has fluctuated wildly between 10 and 190. The average demand in this new regime (P18-P25) is approximately 105.5, which is close to the long-term average, but the standard deviation has spiked significantly (approx 61 compared to approx 26 in the first 17 periods). This volatility led to stockouts (P18, P19, P21) followed by high inventory (P20, P25). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high variance and the recent low demand of 10 in Period 25, I will use a recent window (N=8, covering the high-volatility regime) to capture the current mean and the elevated risk (sigma). This allows the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock to buffer against the seen 150+ spikes, despite the current high on-hand inventory (156).

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility. After the regime shift at Period 18, demand has fluctuated wildly (e.g., 20 in P25, 190 in P21, 55 in P26). The carry-over insight correctly notes this high-variance environment. Since Period 18, the mean demand is approximately 100 ((157+150+20+190+109+88+120+10+55)/9 \u2248 99.9), but the standard deviation is significantly elevated compared to the early periods. Given the high volatility and current on-hand inventory of 105, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's higher variance while centering on the updated average. The lead time L remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 18; although the mean has stabilized near ~100, the range is 10 to 190, requiring high safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime since Period 18. While the mean appears to have stabilized around 100-110 units (the average of the last 10 periods is approximately 103), the range is extremely wide (from 10 to 190). The previous period (P27) saw demand of 84, and we ended with 69 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this high volatility and minimize stockout risk while acknowledging the holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-variance regime without being overly influenced by the lower-variance historical start (P1-P17).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited extreme volatility since Period 18, with values ranging from 10 to 190. While the long-term average (Periods 1-28) is approximately 96, the recent 11-period mean (since the Period 18 shift) is 107.5 with a very high standard deviation (~53). Leading up to Period 29, the demand seems to be on a slight downward trajectory or stabilizing (55, 84, 59 in the last three periods), but the high variance remains a significant risk for stockouts given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, implying a target service level of 80%). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrivals. I will use a recent window of N=11 to capture the high-volatility regime for both demand (mu_hat) and risk (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels remain robust against the large demand swings observed recently, while allowing the OR engine to account for the current on-hand inventory of 89 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited extreme volatility since Period 18, with values ranging from 10 to 190. While the mean since Period 18 is approximately 101, the high variance (standard deviation ~54.7) requires a robust safety stock to maintain a high service level ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost suggests a target service level of 80%). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent history (Periods 18-29) is more volatile than the early history, I am using a recent_N window of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current regime of extreme fluctuations while providing enough samples to stabilize the estimates. The on-hand inventory is 120, and with L=0, the OR engine will determine the order size by aiming for a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 18, characterized by extreme volatility (range 10-190). While the mean demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 21-30) has settled to approximately 83.3, the high standard deviation from this instability necessitates maintaining a robust base stock to avoid stockouts during unpredictable spikes. The promised lead time of 0 remains consistently reliable, as evidenced by all orders (P1-P30) arriving in the same period they were placed. For Period 31, I am using recent_N for both mean and sigma to capture this modern higher-volatility distribution. N=13 is chosen to include the entire high-volatility regime starting at Period 18. This approach ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased demand variance when calculating the safety stock, balancing the $4/unit profit against the $1/unit holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with a significant spike to 138 units in Period 31, immediately exhausting the beginning on-hand inventory of 134. Since the demand regime shift at Period 18, we have observed a mean demand of approximately 95.8 units (Periods 18-31) but with swings ranging from 10 to 190. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable based on historical arrival data. Currently, we start Period 32 with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. To maximize reward while managing this high variance, I am setting mu_hat using the mean of the last 14 periods (since the shift) and using the explicit method for sigma_hat to maintain a high safety stock buffer, accounting for the frequent 150+ demand spikes observed in this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level capable of absorbing current volatility without excessive holding costs during low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 18 has been extremely volatile, characterized by wide swings ranging from 10 to 190 units, compared to the more stable pre-Period 18 average of ~97. Although recent periods (P25-P30) saw a dip, Period 31 spiked again to 138, confirming that high-demand events remains frequent. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. To handle this volatility and avoid stockouts seen in Period 31, I am using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to capture the higher variance since the regime shift at Period 18. Specifically, I am using N=15 to include the entire high-volatility period (P18-P32). This will maintain a higher base stock level to buffer against the unpredictable spikes inherent in this current demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, though the center of the distribution has settled lower than the Period 18-21 spike. Recent demand (P31-P33) has ranged from 27 to 138. The current inventory is 107 units. The actual lead time remains 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the high volatility observed since Period 18, I am using a recent window of 16 periods (from P18 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime. For mu_hat, N=16 covers the period from the initial spike to the present. For sigma_hat, N=16 ensures the safety stock calculation accounts for the extreme swings (20 to 190) seen in this regime, which is necessary to prevent stockouts during unpredictable peaks while maintaining the service level defined by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: Period 31 (138 units), 32 (49 units), 33 (27 units), and 34 (29 units). Although the most recent periods show lower demand, the historical presence of massive spikes (e.g., 190 in P21) requires maintaining a robust safety stock, especially since our profit margin ($4) is much higher than the holding cost ($1). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for the high volatility while acknowledging the recent lower demand cluster, I will use a recent_N window of 17 periods (covering the regime change starting at P18 through to P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures both the extreme peaks and the recent troughs, providing a balanced but cautious base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows continued extreme volatility. Period 35 experienced a significant spike (164 units), resulting in another stockout (ending on-hand: 0). Looking at the post-Period 27 regime (Periods 28-35), the mean demand is approximately 68 units, but with a range of 23 to 164. To account for this volatility and the recent stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the period from the initial regime shift at P18 to now) to capture both the higher mean and the high variance necessary to protect against frequent spikes. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Recent peak demand of 164 in Period 35 reinforces the need for high safety stock due to sustained high volatility (range 23-164) despite a lower overall mean in the last 10 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, as highlighted in the carry_over_insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. In the most recent period (36), demand was 111, following a peak of 164 in Period 35. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is approximately 73.9, but the standard deviation is very high (approx 53.4) due to the range of 23 to 164. To handle this volatility while minimizing stockouts (given the 4:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio, which implies an 80% service level target), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower mean with the high variance observed in this regime. L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, especially since Period 18. While the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 76.5, the recent spikes (138 in P31, 164 in P35) and consistent high-range shifts necessitate a significant safety stock buffer. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable. Given the current on-hand inventory of only 6 units and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio supporting a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the high-variance behavior of the current regime. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the broader volatility observed since the Period 18 shift, preventing stockouts during unpredictable demand peaks.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand levels (P36: 111, P37: 110, P38: 101) suggest a stabilization of the mean around 100-110 units, but the memory of extreme spikes (e.g., P35: 164, P31: 138, P21: 190) requires maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during spikes with holding costs, I am using a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. This window covers the period from P29 to P38, which includes both very low (23) and very high (164) demand points, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock capable of handling the observed variance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 over the last 4 periods (P36-P39: 111, 110, 101, 120), but historical volatility remains a significant concern with frequent spikes above 150 (e.g., P35: 164) and occasional deep drops. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the backend's target service level is high (q=0.8). I will set L to 'default' (0) and use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent stability, while using a larger N=10 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the significant volatility observed in the broader recent regime (range 23 to 164). This strategy ensures we cover the current average demand while maintaining a safety stock buffer against the characteristic volatility of this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 112 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 36-40: 111, 110, 101, 120, 119), which is higher than the early history but less volatile than the chaotic Period 18-35 window. However, the game history shows significant spikes (up to 190) and drops (down to 10), so maintaining a robust safety stock is necessary. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand regime for mu_hat, while using N=23 (from Period 18 onwards) for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extreme volatility observed since the first major regime shift, providing a high service level cover for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 112 units/period (Periods 36-40), but high sigma from Period 18-40 must be maintained to handle historical volatility spikes.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 36-41) has exhibited a stable mean of approximately 110 units (111, 110, 101, 120, 119, 101). However, the long-term history since the regime shift at Period 18 shows extreme volatility (range 10 to 190), which must be accounted for in the safety stock calculation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with observed behavior. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current stable window, and a wider recent_N for sigma_hat (N=24, covering Periods 18-41) to capture the necessary volatility buffer established since the major regime shift.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), with individual values ranging from 101 to 120. This indicates a much more stable regime compared to the extreme volatility seen between P18 and P35 (20 to 190 units). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability over the last 7 periods, I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture this specific mean (avg ~111). However, since historical volatility is high and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I will use a slightly wider window (recent_N of 10) for sigma_hat to maintain sufficient safety stock against potential spikes that characterized earlier gameplay, while acknowledging the current stabilization.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units/period over the last 8 periods (Periods 36-43: 111, 110, 101, 120, 119, 101, 112, 72). However, historical volatility remains a significant factor, with the standard deviation since the regime shift in Period 18 remaining high. Lead time reliably remains 0 (same-period arrival). For Period 44, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~106) and recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to maintain a wider safety buffer against the volatility spikes observed in the broader 'high-volatility' regime. This balances the risk of stockouts against holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 36-43 demonstrate a stable mean of ~106 units with a narrower range compared to the extreme shifts between Periods 18-35.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P36-P44) with a mean demand of approximately 105.7 units. This represents a distinct regime compared to the extreme volatility observed between Periods 18 and 35. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently actualized, as seen in the Period 44 conclude message (ordered P44, arrived P44). To optimize the base stock level, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture this stable regime (P36-P44). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9; while historical volatility was higher, the current regime's standard deviation better reflects the immediate risk, and the OR backend's service level logic (based on profit $4 vs holding cost $1, q=0.8) will provide sufficient safety stock for the current variance. On-hand inventory is 37, so the OR engine will calculate the order to reach the base stock for the (1+L) period demand.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), with a mean of approximately 103 units. While the historical volatility from Period 18-35 was extreme (range 10-190), the most recent regime displays a much tighter range (72-120), suggesting a return to a more predictable pattern. The inventory status is currently 38 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded periods. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stable regime while providing sufficient data to account for the localized variance. This approach balances the need to minimize stockouts against the holding cost of $1.0/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 36-45: Mean ~103, Range 72-120. This indicates a significant reduction in the extreme volatility observed between Periods 18-35.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized between Period 36 and Period 46, showing a mean of approximately 103 units and significantly reduced volatility compared to the Period 18-35 window. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Since the demand regime has been stable for 11 periods (P36-P46), I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N with N=11 allows the OR backend to capture the current lower-mean, lower-volatility state while still maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the observed range (72-120). This approach balances the lower holding cost against the service level needed for this stable but still variable retail product.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 36, following a highly volatile phase (Periods 18-35). Over the last 12 periods (P36-P47), the mean demand is approximately 101 units, with much lower variance than the preceding regime. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P43-P47) show a mean of 87.2, but the broader stabilization since P36 provides a more robust baseline. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in history. With Period 48 being near the end of the simulation (Period 50), maintaining this stable policy is optimal to minimize holding costs while ensuring service level.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 36, following a period of extreme volatility (Periods 18-35). Over the last 13 periods (P36-P48), the mean demand is approximately 100 units (calculated as 1296 total demand / 13 periods \u2248 99.7). The range has also narrowed significantly to [72, 120] during this regime, compared to the previous range of [10, 190]. Given the stable mean and reduced variance, I am selecting N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while ignoring the outdated extreme volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history, so the default promised lead time is appropriate. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the current 100-unit average plus a safe margin for the current variance without over-stocking for past extremes.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 36, following a period of extreme volatility (Periods 18-35). Over the last 14 periods (P36-P49), the mean demand is approximately 99.6, with a much narrower range (72-120) compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. The current on-hand inventory is low (12 units), necessitating a replenishment order to meet the next period's demand. I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 to capture this stable post-volatility mean, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=14 to reflect the significantly reduced, yet still present, standard deviation in this regime. This approach ensures sufficient safety stock for the current stability while avoiding the excessive buffers generated by the extreme Period 18-35 spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 36-49: Mean ~100, Range 72-120. Volatility has effectively halved compared to the P18-P35 period.
