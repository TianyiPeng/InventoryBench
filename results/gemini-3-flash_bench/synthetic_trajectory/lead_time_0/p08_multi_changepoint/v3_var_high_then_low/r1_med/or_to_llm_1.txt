There is no clear seasonal trend yet, but demand occasionally spikes above 140.\n3. Inventory Position: Current on-hand inventory is 14 units. There are 0 units in-transit. \n4.

Adjustment: To ensure high service levels given the volatility (max demand seen was 145), and considering we currently have 14 units, ordering 113 units brings total available stock to 127. While this covers the mean, a slightly higher order (120 units) provides a better buffer against the observed spikes without excessive holding costs, as on-hand is low and profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1).

The current on-hand inventory is 123 units, which is more than double the recent average demand.\n\n3. **Inventory & OR Reconcilliation**: The OR algorithm recommends ordering only 5 units.

Given that the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (critical fractile 0.8), the target inventory level should roughly cover 80th-90th percentile demand. With a mean of ~52 and significant volatility, a base stock around 120-130 units is reasonable.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: Since on-hand inventory (123) already covers the next period's expected demand and provides a buffer, and lead time is 0 (allowing for instant replenishment next period if needed), there is no need to order significant quantities.

We currently have 100 units on hand. Given the high profitability ($4) versus the low holding cost ($1), under-stocking is more costly than over-stocking. The carry-over insights highlight that demand is unstable, with a recent spike of 138 occurring just two periods ago. While the current 100 units might cover another low-demand period (like the 27 units seen in P33), the risk of another spike (like the 138 in P31 or 190 in P21) suggests we should maintain a higher base stock. If we follow the OR's recommendation of 26, our total available for Period 34 (including the 100 on-hand) would be 126 units. This is insufficient to cover the upside potential seen in the 'high volatility' regime.

The OR recommendation of 85 units is based on historical averages and is designed to provide a 95% service level with a cap. Given that the game is approaching its final periods (P48 of 50), and on-hand inventory is 41, adding 85 units would create a total availability of 126 units for Period 48. This safely covers the recent average (87) and recent peak (105-112), while minimizing the risk of high ending inventory at the game's conclusion (P50), where excessive holding costs could offset final profits. Following the OR recommendation is prudent here.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Orders placed in the current period arrive and satisfy demand within the same period.\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 41 units. Demand has moderated to an average of ~89 units over the last 7 periods (P42-P48). In the last two periods, demand was 99 and 85 units respectively. Period 50 is the final period (T=50), so any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur a holding cost without future benefit.\n3. **Strategy**: To maximize profit for the remaining periods (49 and 50), I need to cover Period 49's demand and set up for Period 50. Since L=0, an order placed now covers Period 49. The OR recommendation is 85 units. Given on-hand is 41 and avg demand is ~90, an order of 85 units brings total availability to 126 units. This safely covers current demand levels while leaving a buffer (approx 36 units) for Period 50. This is a balanced approach that avoids stockouts while minimizing the risk of high ending inventory in the final period.",

{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. Demand has recently stabilized around a mean of approximately 94 units (Period 42-49 average is ~91.75). The OR baseline suggests an order of 100 units, which is designed to cover the expected demand and maintain a small safety buffer given current on-hand inventory of 25. An order of 100 units, combined with the 25 units on-hand, provides 125 units for Period 50. Given that the recent demand peak was 112 (P42) and the average is near 90, 125 units provides sufficient coverage (approx. 1.35x current average) while minimizing holding costs for the final period.
