Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Historical demand over the first 5 periods (which are available as samples) is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126], giving a mean of 85.8 and a standard deviation of 25.5. Since internal policy dictates a base stock model, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent sample set. L is set to 'default' (0) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and order enough to cover Period 1 demand (since L=0 means same-period arrival). This balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 86 units with a promised lead time (L) of 0. The order arrived the same period, confirming L=0. However, demand (98) exceeded supply (86), resulting in 12 lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. Historical demand over 5 periods (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows an average of ~85.8. The most recent demand (Period 5 in historical data was 126, but the 'conclude' message for Period 1 shows 98) suggests high volatility or a potential upward trend. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. Since we are at 0 stock and had stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (98, 126, 85) to ensure better coverage for the next period.

Daily Profit: $62.00, Daily Holding Cost: $41.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 (98) and Period 2 (62) resulted in an average demand of 80 units per period. The most recent demand sample from Period 3 (79) aligns closely with this average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 41 units. Since lead time L=0, the OR backend logic will target a base stock to cover demand for the current period (L+1=1). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock will likely target the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior (84, 55, 79) and 'calculate' for lead time since performance has been consistent with the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals for Period 1, 2, and 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management is currently operating with a stockout in Period 1 and a carry-over surplus in Period 2. Demand history (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows an upward trend in Period 5, though the current Period 4 observation is not yet concluded. Given lead time is 0, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand, which is currently 1 period. To avoid stockouts while managing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), I will use the average of the last 4 periods of demand (approx 76) to set mu_hat, while using default settings for lead time and sigma_hat to capture the historical volatility.

Daily Profit: $89.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm that orders placed in Periods 1 through 4 arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has shown significant volatility: 98, 62, 68, 96 in the first four periods, with a spike to 126 in the current Period 5. The mean demand over 5 periods is 90.0, but the recent observation of 126 suggests a potential upward shift or high variance. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine should target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent spike and 'default' for sigma_hat to include all historical volatility, ensuring a balanced stock level that accounts for the most recent demand increase while maintaining the lead time at the confirmed 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 concluded periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). Demand shows a recent spike in Period 5 (126 units in user-provided historical data), though the 'conclude' message for Period 5 reports demand of 84. I will reconcile the historical demand list (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) which averages 85.8. Periods 1-4 conclude logs show demands of 98, 62, 68, 96. Combining these, the mean remains around 86-88. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most relevant demand patterns. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning we target a safety stock at the median. I will stick with the default calculation for lead time (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1-6) confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand has shown some variability but generally fluctuates around a mean. Observations for the first 5 periods provided in the prompt (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) and the demand resolution from the history (P1: 98, P2: 62, P3: 68, P4: 96, P5: 84, P6: 56) suggest a slight softening in the last two periods compared to the spike in P4/P5. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand level while accounting for recent volatility. The holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio for the base stock is 0.5; this target service level suggests we should aim to stocking close to the mean demand plus some safety stock to cover the review+lead period (1+0=1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has fluctuated between 56 and 98 over the last 7 periods, with a mean of approximately 78.4. Period 5 saw a temporary peak (126 noted in sample data, though the conclude messages show demand of 84, 56, and 85 in the most recent periods). The game history shows demand for Period 7 was 85, which exhausted the 74 units available on-hand. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current demand average (approx 78) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to meet expected demand for the current period while balancing the relatively high holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time L=0 has been consistently observed across all 8 periods (actual lead time 0). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a recent spike: Period 8 demand was 115, following a Period 7 demand of 85, compared to an earlier average of ~77. The last 4 periods (P5-P8) have a mean demand of 85, while the last 2 periods significantly exceed that. Given the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. To prevent stockouts seen in P7 and P8, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand trend while maintaining L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent upward movement, particularly in the most recent periods (P7-P9), where demand (85, 115, 88) frequently exceeded on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. To address the stockouts and capture the current demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (covering periods 5-9) to reflect the recent higher average demand (approx 97 units/period). I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to better capture the recent volatility (e.g., the spike to 115 in Period 8). The base stock level calculated by the backend will target a 50% service level because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0) (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR engine will aim to stock the mean demand when Lead Time is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand has shown some volatility, with values ranging from 39 to 115. Most recently, Period 10 saw a low demand of 39, which followed a consistent period of higher demand (mean approx. 85). Because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend aims to stock the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to encompass all available historical demand samples (Periods 1-10) to provide a stable estimate of the mean and variance, balancing the recent low demand against previous higher spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations. Over the first five periods (provided in the prompt's demand data: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126), the mean was 85.8. Since then, the realized demand has been: P1=98, P2=62, P3=68, P4=96, P5=84, P6=56, P7=85, P8=115, P9=88, P10=39, P11=76. The recent average (P7-P11) is 80.8, which is slightly lower than the overall average. Because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At this service level, the base stock target should be the median demand. Given the ongoing volatility and recent lower demand in P10, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining enough samples to cushion against the high variance seen in P8. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being met consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 78 units over the last 12 periods (mean = 79.5), with a standard deviation around 20. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period they were placed). Currently, we have 4 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Since Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand for (L+1) periods (which is 1 period in this case). Using the most recent 12 samples (all available) provides a stable estimate of the demand distribution without overreacting to individual spikes or drops seen in periods 8 or 10.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, although stockouts are occurring frequently (Periods 7, 8, 9, 13) because the replenishment policy is not adequately covering demand volatility. The average demand over all periods is approximately 79 units, with recent demand (last 3 periods) averaging 82 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent frequent stockouts and maximize profit while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 resulting in a 0.5 service level target in the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the most representative demand average and 'default' for sigma_hat to include the full historical variance for better stockout protection. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 0 periods has been reliably observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This leads to a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (Periods 1-14) confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand has been relatively stable but show signs of stockouts (Periods 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14 resulted in 0 ending inventory), suggesting that demand often exceeds the on-hand stock and actual demand may be slightly higher than sold units. The mean observed demand is approximately 82 units per period. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to affirm the 0-period trend and 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent average and volatility across the full history, as no major regime change is yet clear, but we must account for the high frequency of stockouts in the historical period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with a mean demand of 79.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the recent demand distribution while smoothing out the volatility observed in the initial 5-period sample (where mean was higher at 85.8). This window size provides a balance between responsiveness to recent trends and statistical stability. Lead time is confirmed as 0, so L=default (base_stock covers 1 period).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility but remains centered around a mean of approx 80-85 units per period. Specifically, Period 16 saw a spike to 133 demand, causing a stockout. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To address the recent spike and compensate for the current zero inventory state, I will use recent history (N=5) to capture recent demand trends while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat, using recent_N (N=5) results in a mean of (1+0) * ((94+95+55+133+85)/5) \u2248 92.4. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=5) captures the current higher variance. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's expected demand and recent fluctuations while balancing the high holding cost (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0 results in a 50% critical ratio/service level target).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown high volatility with several stock-outs (Period 13, 14, 16, 17) where demand exceeded on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and sales. The mean demand over the first 17 periods is approximately 81.2 units, but recent periods (13-17) show a slightly higher and more volatile demand pattern including a spike of 133 in Period 16. To prevent further stock-outs and capture potential demand spikes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to better reflect recent demand trends while maintaining a high service level, as Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal (q=0.5). Increasing sigma_hat with an explicit value higher than historical standard deviation to ensure safety stock covers the high-end spikes observed (e.g., 133 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high demand persistence with a critical stockout pattern (ending inventory hit 0 in 11 out of 18 periods). Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. However, due to frequent stockouts, the observed sales are likely lower than actual demand in periods 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18. Actual demand averages significantly above the current ordering levels. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrives in the same period). To capture the recent variability and ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance and demand spikes (e.g., Period 16 reached 133 units), I am selecting a recent_N method with N=10 to reflect the most recent regime more accurately. This N covers the high-demand periods (13-18) while maintaining some stability from earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase, particularly in Period 19 where demand reached 166 units, compared to the previous average of approximately 82 units. This spike suggests a possible regime shift or a period of high volatility. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Since the ending inventory has been 0 for multiple periods (P16-P19), indicating missed sales, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 15-19) to capture the recent upward trend in both mean and volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this higher demand profile. The backend OR tool will then calculate a higher base stock to improve service levels and mitigate the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~82 to ~109 over the last 5 periods (P15-19), with a significant peak of 166 in Period 19. Repeated stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0) in 7 of the last 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant shift upwards. The mean demand for Period 16-20 is approximately 120.8, compared to the overall mean of 86.6. Stockouts have occurred consistently over the last 5 periods (ending inventory=0 in P16-P20), meaning true demand is likely even higher than sales. Specifically, Period 19 demand was 166 and Period 20 was 115. To address this, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime. Given the frequent stockouts and high demand variability (sigma), I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat as well to provide a higher safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: mean demand for P16-P20 is ~121, significantly higher than the initial average of ~82. Frequent stockouts continue, indicating potential under-estimation of demand peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant upwards regime shift. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 118.8, contrasting with the earlier average of around 82. Frequent stockouts have occurred in 7 of the last 9 periods, primarily because the order quantities (based on previous averages) were insufficient to meet the spikes (e.g., 166 in P19, 133 in P16). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand level and prevent further stockouts, I am setting L to default (0). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat to base the forecast on the new regime (recent average ~119). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this new phase, ensuring a higher safety stock to achieve a better service level for this high-margin-relative-to-holding-cost item (effective q=0.5 but since lost sales are not backordered, we need to be more aggressive).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift: mean demand for P16-P21 is ~119 vs ~82 in P1-P15 (+45% increase), with high volatility (~24 standard deviation in recent window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand from P16 to P22 is approximately 115.7, which is a significant increase from the earlier baseline of ~82. Specifically, recent demands have been: P19=166, P20=115, P21=109, and P22=97. Despite the slight softening in P22, we have experienced frequent stockouts (ending inventory = 0 in 5 of the last 7 periods), indicating that previous ordering was too conservative. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To better capture this higher demand regime and prevent stockouts while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire window since the regime shift began, providing a robust mean and variance estimate to handle the current demand level and its inherent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift remains evident. While the most recent three periods (P21-23) show a slight cooling from the extreme peak in P19 (166), demand in P21 (109), P22 (97), and P23 (86) still averages approximately 97.3, compared to the overall P1-P15 average of ~82. The CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS from P22 highlight a mean demand of ~119 for the period P16-P21. However, the last three periods suggest the demand might be stabilizing at a level higher than the original baseline but lower than the P19 peak. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward a base stock at the median (50th percentile). To capture the sustained elevated demand while acknowledging the recent slight decline from the peak, I will use a window of the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P16-P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand shift with the most recent data points to avoid overstocking while ensuring enough inventory to meet the new average demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear upward shift starting around Period 16, with the most recent sample (Period 24) hitting 169 units, causing a total stockout (sold 112, ending inventory 0). The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 118.8 units, compared to the early baseline of 82. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this shift and high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 30 in the recent window), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to focus on the high-demand regime. The backend target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (as profit=holding), meaning the base stock targets the median demand. Given the frequent stockouts, I am ensuring the stats reflect this higher median.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: P16-P24 mean demand is 118.8 (+45% vs P1-P15), with a recent peak of 169 in Period 24 resulting in lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Period 1 and Period 15, the mean demand was approximately 81. Since Period 16, the demand mean has shifted upward to approximately 117, with extreme peaks (like 169 in Period 24 and 167 in Period 25) causing frequent stockouts. The last two periods (24 and 25) saw demands of 169 and 167, yet we only sold 112 and 119 respectively due to limited inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this higher demand regime and high volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (covering the P16-P25 shift). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, but because we are suffering from constant stockouts, the OR backend's cap and the base stock calculation need to reflect the most recent, higher-demand window to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand for P16-P25 is 126.6 (+56% vs P1-P15), with two consecutive peaks above 165 in Periods 24 and 25 leading to consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 16. Comparing the first 15 periods (mean ~82) to the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand has surged to approximately 130.3. Notably, the last three periods (P24, P25, P26) have shown extreme consistency and high volume with demands of 169, 167, and 168 respectively, all of which resulted in stockouts. The OR engine's default base-stock calculation is based on the service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median. Given the persistent stockouts and recent surge, I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the elevated mean of the current regime while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma). This should raise the base stock enough to attempt to satisfy these new peak levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand for P16-P26 is ~130 (+58% vs P1-P15), with three consecutive periods (P24-P26) showing near-identical peaks around 168 units leading to continuous stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, with a baseline mean increasing from ~82 to ~130. The last period (P27) saw a demand of 111, which is a slight softening from the peak levels of ~168 seen in P24-P26, but still significantly above the initial levels. Frequent stockouts indicate the base stock level has been too low to capture peak demand episodes. With a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in history), I am setting L to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=12 to capture the elevated demand regime (P16 onwards) while smoothing the extreme volatility. This N-window covers the period from P16 to P27, accurately reflecting the current high-demand environment (~130 units mean) and ensuring the OR backend targets a service level closer to the high-end spikes of ~160-170 units to prevent further lost sales.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent window (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 124.9 units, a substantial increase from the initial average of ~82. Recent volatility is also high, with peaks reaching ~169 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the increased demand and frequent historical stockouts (P24-P26), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 periods (P16-P28) to capture this higher demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level, balancing the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost while ensuring enough inventory to meet the new performance ceiling of ~169 units without excessive overstocking, as observed in the lower demand of P28 (77 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift since Period 16, with a more pronounced acceleration observed starting from Period 24. While the initial average (P1-P15) was ~82, the average demand from P16 to P29 has increased to approximately 121. More critically, the variance has increased dramatically with frequent spikes reaching the 165-170 range (Periods 19, 24, 25, 26). These spikes have caused repeated stockouts because the OR backend's default parameters (using all-time historical data) are lagging behind this new volatility. To capture this new 'high-demand, high-volatility' regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (covering the period since the initial shift at P16). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher mean (~121) and the recent spikes. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Since P16, demand has not only increased in mean (from ~82 to ~121) but has developed a pattern of sharp peaks (~168) occurring approximately every 5-7 periods, necessitating higher safety stock levels to prevent stockouts during these surges.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~82 to ~121, characterized by periodic spikes around 168. In the most recent window (Periods 25-30), demand has averaged 122.6 with a peak of 167 in Period 25. The last few periods (P27-P30) show demand stabilizing slightly but still significantly higher than the initial phase. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level plus safety stock. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier (notably P24-P26), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the entire 'high' regime since Period 16. I am using sigma_hat with recent_N=7 to capture the high volatility seen in the most recent peak-and-plateau sequence. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, with the mean demand increasing from ~82 to approximately 119-130 units. We are currently in Period 32. In the most recent window (P27-P31), demand has been 111, 77, 109, 104, and 120 (Avg: 104.2). However, earlier peaks in P24-P26 reached ~168 units. The 'Carry-over Insights' note a pattern of sharp peaks occurring every 5-7 periods; since the last peak was in P26, we are entering the window (P31-P33) where another surge is possible. The promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0. To capture the current regime and prepare for the potential surge, I will use a recent window (N=16, encompassing the regime shift from P16 onwards) for mu_hat to capture the elevated mean while providing enough safety stock for the high volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand has been approximately 121.3 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units). To avoid stockouts during demand peaks while balancing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (P16-P32) to capture the current high-demand regime. This provides the OR backend with a more accurate mean and volatility estimate for the current environment.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, moving from an initial mean of ~82 to a more recent mean of ~121 (P16-P33). Specifically, over the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is 127.4 with high volatility, including three consecutive periods of demand near 168 (P24-P26) causing stockouts. The inventory has remained extremely low (On-hand: 4), indicating that we are operating at the edge of capacity. To capture the current high-demand state and provide sufficient safety stock for the recurring peaks identified in the Carry-over Insights, I am using a recent window of N=18 (P16-P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This encompasses the entire high-demand regime. Since the lead time is consistently 0, L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods of the game. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 120 units, compared to the initial average of ~82 units. Recent periods (P31-P34) have shown demand values of 120, 103, 116, and 90, maintaining this elevated mean. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. The target stocking level needs to account for this higher mean and the periodic spikes observed around 168 units. Using a window of the last 19 samples (N=19, from P16 to P34) captures this higher demand regime accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that appropriately balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost while mitigating the risk of stockouts during demand surges.

Recent demand (P31-P35) confirms this, averaging 109.6 units, but frequent stockouts (P35 ended at 0 inventory) indicate that the OR engine's current safety stock is insufficient to handle the volatility. The target service level (q) is 50% since Profit = Holding Cost ($1.0 each), which means the base OR logic aims for the median. However, due to the high volatility and periodic spikes to ~168 units (noted in Period 30 carry-over), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean and variance more accurately while remaining responsive to the shift. I will maintain L=0 as all shipments have arrived in the same period they were ordered.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is significantly higher than the initial phase, with a mean of approximately 119 units and periodic spikes reaching 169. Period 35 and 36 both resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that recent orders were insufficient to cover demand. To capture this elevated regime while remaining responsive to the high volatility (standard deviation ~28 in the recent regime), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 21 periods (P16-P36). This period captures the entire high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that better accounts for the current mean and the risk of spikes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 16 remains sustained through Period 37. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P31-P37), the mean demand is approximately 109. However, the carry-over insights correctly highlight periodic volatility and peaks that reach up to 169 (P24-P26). Since Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.0 each), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand for its base stock calculation. However, due to recent stockouts and the specific pattern of surges identified in P30's insight, I will use a window of N=7 (P31-P37) to capture the current mean while maintaining the OR engine's ability to cover variance. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, and the system is recovering from recent stockouts in P35 and P36.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing the mean from ~82 to ~121 with recurring peaks around 168 every 5-7 periods. In the most recent block (P31-P38), demand has stabilized at a slightly lower mean of ~108 with lower variance compared to the P24-P26 surge, but stockouts still occurred in P35, P36, and P38 because the OR backend's cap was too restrictive for real-time demand fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To better handle the current regime and ensure adequate safety stock, I am using a recent window of N=23 (covering Period 16 to Period 38) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime while moving away from the initial low-demand period (P1-P15). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand level and volatility seen since Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, moving from an average of ~82 units to approximately 117 units. Recent demand (P31-P39) shows a mean of 115.3 units. There is a recurring pattern of periodic spikes (e.g., P19, P24-P26, P31, P35, P38) that often exceed current inventory and lead to stockouts. Despite a promised lead time of 0, actual lead time has consistently been 0 as confirmed by all concluded periods. Current on-hand inventory is 40. Given the high cost of stocking out (lost profit) versus holding cost (1:1 ratio), a slightly aggressive base stock is needed to cover the mean demand plus a safety margin for the next spike. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility (P30-P39 mean is ~115, std is ~13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher-volume regime compared to the early game. Since Period 16, the mean demand has shifted from ~82 to ~115, with periodic peaks reaching 165-170 units. Recent demand (P31-P40) averages 105 units, but frequent stockouts (e.g., P35, P36, P38) indicate that the safety stock is insufficient to handle localized volatility even when the mean is relatively stable. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable per the 'conclude' messages. To avoid further stockouts while balancing holding costs (which equal profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility (P31-P40). This N is chosen to reflect the most recent sustained behavior without being overly skewed by the extreme peaks seen in the P20s, but still providing enough safety buffer for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P30: mean demand is ~105-110 units with standard deviation of ~15, maintaining zero lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 105-110 units since Period 31, following a highly volatile period. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P32-P41) show an average demand of 110.8 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 22 units. To maintain an optimal service level and prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs, I will use a recent window of 10 periods to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This timeframe captures the stabilized post-peak behavior better than the full history, while still accounting for recent demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current context shows a stable demand regime post-Period 31 with a mean of approximately 105 units. Recent demand has been slightly lower (P39: 77, P40: 93, P41: 83, P42: 66), suggesting a possible downward shift or just standard volatility. The inventory position is healthy with 35 units on-hand and an actual lead time consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to the slightly lower recent demand while maintaining coverage for potential peaks (as noted in Period 30), I am using a 'recent_N' approach. For mu_hat, N=12 is selected to capture the stabilized regime since Period 31 (P31-P42), balancing the older high-demand periods with the very recent lower samples. For sigma_hat, a shorter window (N=7) is used to better reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), effectively targeting a 50% service level plus safety stock derived from the variance.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the current on-hand inventory is 11 units. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 41, the demand regime has stabilized with a mean around 105-110 units, although very recent demand in Periods 41-43 (83, 66, 89) has been slightly lower than that average. However, given the product (chips) and historical volatility (spikes around 168), I will use a recent window to capture the current stable-but-variable demand. I'm choosing N=13 (covering Periods 31-43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to encompass the post-P30 stabilization period, which captures both the steadier mean and some of the inherent volatility seen in the 30s. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand plus adequate safety stock for this regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the stabilized regime identified around Period 41, with recent demand values of 83, 66, 89, and 115. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 97 units. Although the most recent demand (P44) spiked to 115, resulting in a stockout (Ending Inventory = 0), the overall trend is consistent with the established mean of ~100-105. Period 45 is approaching the end of the simulation (P50), so maintaining a stock level that covers mean demand plus a safety margin is appropriate. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable mean (~101) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (approx 17) to prevent further stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time is 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (post-Period 30) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 105-110 units and a standard deviation around 15. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all recent orders have arrived within the same period. For Period 46, on-hand inventory is 25 units. Since we are in a relatively stable demand phase near the end of the simulation (Period 46 of 50), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the stabilized mean and variance (P31-P45). This window covers the stabilized regime while being large enough to provide a robust statistical estimate. The OR engine's critical ratio (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) is 0.5 for this SKU, leading to a base stock targeting the median demand; however, the capped policy will help prevent excessive over-ordering if the variance spikes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized since Period 41, with a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units and a standard deviation of about 19 based on the last 6 periods (P41-P46). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a slight stockout in Period 46 where demand (114) exceeded available stock (99). To optimize for Period 47, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to reflect this stabilized post-P41 regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent mean (~92.5) and the volatility noted in recent fluctuates. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will hover around the mean demand, but the OR backend's safety stock logic and the cap will provide a buffer against the observed volatility.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~96 units with moderate volatility (std ~15) since Period 41. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), and there are no units in transit. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR backend should target the median demand. I will use a recent window of N=7 (Periods 41-47) to capture this stable post-peak behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N helps the controller focus on the current regime rather than the high-volatility peaks seen around Period 30 or the early period lower averages.

Daily Profit: $90.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30 into a regime with a mean of approximately 92-95 units and a standard deviation of approximately 15-20 units. In the most recent block (P41-P48), the average demand is 91.8. While there were significant peaks in the P20-P30 range (~168), demand hasn't reached those levels recently, with the highest recent demand being 115 (P44). The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 48 (demand 110 vs supply 90). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure high service level given the equal cost of profit and holding ($1.0), I will use the recent N (N=9, covering P40-P48) to capture the current stabilized mean and variance, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a reasonable safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 41 has stabilized around a mean of ~92 units per period (analyzing P41-P49: 83, 66, 89, 115, 73, 114, 84, 110, 95). This is lower than the high-volatility peak seen between Periods 24-30, but still higher than the initial average. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. In Period 49, we ended with 0 inventory after selling all 92 units that arrived. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this stable post-P40 regime. This provides a focused estimate of recent average demand (~92) and variance (~17) without being skewed by older high-volatility spikes. L remains 'default' as it is consistently 0.
