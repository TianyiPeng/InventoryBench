Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive within the same period's Arrival Resolution phase. I have 5 historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The mean of these samples is 85.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Since Period 5 shows a potential upward shift (126), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture the full distribution, acknowledging that the OR backend will calculate (1+L) * mean. With L=0, this targets demand for the current period. I will monitor for a confirmed regime shift in subsequent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 108 units which arrived immediately (lead time 0), ending with 21 units on hand after 87 units of demand. The promised lead time is 0, and the observed lead time for Period 1 was 0. However, the initial demand sample (87) is slightly higher than the average of the provided historical samples (mean of P1-P5 is ~85.8, but P1 demand was 87, P2 historical was 55, etc.). Since we only have one period of actual game history and P1's demand (87) is close to the historical mean, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the local trend while acknowledging the variance seen in the history [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the initial observation matches the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $322.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the observed lead time has been 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand in Period 1 was 87 and in Period 2 was 86, which is higher than the initial historical data average (approx 85). Period 5 in the historical data showed a significant spike (126), suggesting high volatility or an upward trend. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system should prioritize a higher service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent high demand periods (87 and 86) more heavily while keeping L at the promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms an actual lead time (W = X - Z) of 0 periods (e.g., Period 3: ordered P3, arrived P3). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this observation. Demand has been relatively stable but showed a slight spike in the initial samples provided (up to 126 in sample history) compared to the game history (62-87). To balance the slightly lower demand seen in the game history (avg ~78) with the higher initial samples (avg ~86 overall), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most relevant recent demand patterns while acknowledging the variability seen across all available data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data from Periods 1-4 confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0. Looking at the demand history (87, 86, 62, 80), there is a slight dip in Period 3 but it rebounded in Period 4. The average demand over the last 4 periods is 78.75 units. In Period 5, I am currently at the decision phase, meaning the demand for Period 5 (126 units as per historical context) has not yet been deducted from the on-hand inventory of 29. Because the order arriving in Period 5 happens after my decision but within the same period (L=0), I need to ensure the base stock covers Period 5's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stable demand pattern while smoothing out the Period 3 dip. Setting L=0 explicitly acknowledges the confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of 5 concluded periods, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (shipments arrive in the same period they are ordered). Demand shows some fluctuation: periods 1, 2, and 4 had demands in the 80s, while periods 3 and 5 were in the early 60s or late 50s. The provided historical list (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) suggests a potential spike in period 5 that wasn't reflected in the user's specific 'conclude' message (which stated 58). However, looking at the provided demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), there is a significant jump in Period 5 (126). Since seasonal details are unavailable, I will use all 5 samples to capture this recent spike while maintaining a base. Lead time L will be set to the default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all 5 samples to account for the increased volatility seen in the sample data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has averaged approximately 76.5 units over the first six periods. However, recent periods show significant volatility (80, 58, 86). Period 6 saw higher demand (86), leaving only 1 unit on-hand. All previous orders (P1-P6) arrived within the same period (Lead Time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 is reliable. I will set L to 'default' (0). Since the demand fluctuates without a clear sustained trend yet, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current mean (approx 76.5) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the observed variability (std approx 14). With L=0, the OR backend will target a base stock sufficient for the immediate period's demand (mu_hat + safety stock), which is crucial given the low on-hand inventory of 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical conclusions for Periods 1 through 7 consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability but with noticeable fluctuations, ranging from 58 to 87 units. The last three periods (P5-P7) had demands of 58, 86, and 77, respectively. Given the change in demand volatility and the recent spike in Period 6, I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 (covering Periods 3-7) to capture current demand levels while smoothing out short-term noise. Since L=0, the backend will calculate base stock for 1 period of coverage (1+L).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 8 periods, ranging between 58 and 87 units. The average demand across these periods is approximately 76.6 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) with 0 in-transit. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, as the demand shows slight fluctuations. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time history.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods based on all 9 historical periods. Demand has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 58 and 87 units. The most recent demand (Periods 6-9) shows a slight upward trend (86, 77, 77, 83) compared to the mid-game dip in Period 5. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we need to ensure the order covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the current demand level which averages around 81 units per period. The sigma_hat will also be based on this recent window to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 95 units, which exceeded the total inventory of 85, resulting in 10 units of lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. Looking at the historical demand for Period 1 through Period 10 (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77, 83, 95), there is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift, although the last five periods (averaging 83.6) are slightly higher than the first five (averaging 74.6). Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. To ensure we capture the recent slight increase in demand and avoid further lost sales, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to encompass the full updated demand distribution, which has a mean of 79.1. An average of 79.1 * (1+0) = 79.1 will be the basis, and the OR backend will calculate the safety stock based on the high cost of underage ($4) vs overage ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we experienced a stockout (demand 92, sold 89) leaving 0 units on-hand. The current lead time (L) is consistently 0. Demand history shows a recent uptick: Periods 1-9 averaged ~77 units/period, but Periods 10-11 averaged ~93.5 units/period. The initial 5 samples (P1-P5 in system prompt) had an average of 86, aligning closer to the recent spike. To prevent lost sales and maintain high service levels (profit-to-holding cost ratio suggests a high target service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher demand volatility and mean. L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: average increased from ~77 to ~93.5 (~20% increase) leading to two consecutive periods of stockouts.

The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 10. While Periods 10 and 11 had demand levels of 95 and 92 (causing stockouts), Period 12 dropped to 71. However, the average across the last three completed periods (P10-P12) is 86. This still suggests a slightly higher demand regime than the pre-Period 10 average (which was ~77). We have an on-hand inventory of 21 and zero in-transit units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle the increased variability and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent low demand reading in Period 12, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent regime shift dynamics.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) showed a shift starting Period 10. While periods 10 and 11 had high demand (95 and 92) leading to stockouts, the last two periods (Period 12 and 13) recorded lower demand (71 and 86). The current carry-over insight suggests a regime shift to ~93.5, but the absolute average of the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 86. Given the volatility (std dev ~10.6 in this 4-period window), I will use the recent 4 periods to set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to better reflect this recent regime while protecting against stockouts. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods according to history.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10. For the first 9 periods, the average demand was approximately 77.4. From Period 10 to Period 14, the average demand increased to 86.8 units (95, 92, 71, 86, 90). The previous carry-over insight noted a shift to ~93.5, but with Period 12's dip to 71 and recent outcomes, the current mean of this new regime is closer to 87. To prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 10 and 11, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this higher-demand regime (Periods 10-14). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting actual lead time, so I will stick with the default calculation for L. The inventory is currently low (on-hand: 5), so the OR backend should trigger a replenishment order to meet the higher forecasted demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10, with mean demand increasing from ~77 to ~93. Period 15 showed continued high demand (97), which led to another stockout as the on-hand inventory was insufficient. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent recurring stockouts and capture the higher demand target, I will use recent history (N=6, from Period 10 to 15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focus on the latest regime (mean ~88.5, but biased by stockouts in periods 10, 11, and 15) ensures the base stock reflects the current higher-volume environment. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift. Following the previously identified regime shift at Period 10 (avg ~93.5), Period 16 recorded a demand spike of 138, which is the highest observed value and significantly above the mean of the current regime. This spike suggests either a new, higher demand regime or a seasonal outlier. The last several periods (10-16) show a pattern of stockouts or near-zero inventory (Ending On-hand: 0, 0, 21, 12, 5, 0, 0), indicating the current ordering policy is under-forecasting demand. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and a promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently met), I need to set a base stock that covers the most recent, higher demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since Period 10, which averages 94.8 units\u2014more reactive to the current trend without over-indexing on the single 138 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand spiked to 138 (previous high was 126 in samples, 97 in game history), intensifying the upward trend observed since Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, a high order (113) was placed because of the massive demand spike in Period 16 (138). The Period 17 conclusion shows demand at 99, which is still significantly higher than the pre-Period 10 average (~77). Since Period 10, we have seen a clear upward shift in demand which intensified significantly in the last few periods. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 96.6, compared to the earlier baseline. Given the recent variability and the massive spike in Period 16, a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (the start of the regime shift) covers this new higher-demand level while sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using these parameters should prevent further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a strong upward trend and increased volatility. Following the regime shift identified in Period 10, demand has spiked significantly in Period 16 (138) and Period 18 (129), resulting in repeated stockouts (ending inventory 0 in Periods 10, 11, 15, 16, and 18). The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P10-P18) is approximately 99.6, compared to the overall game average of roughly 89. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, favoring higher stock levels. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture the recent higher demand levels and the increased variance (ranging from 71 to 138 in the recent regime), I will use the recent_N method with N=9. This captures the entire window since the first major regime shift while prioritizing the higher values seen lately, ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are elevated to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased since Period 10, with spikes frequently exceeding 125 units, significantly higher than early-game averages (~77).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 10, with high volatility and spikes reaching 138 units. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 100.3, compared to the early game average of ~77. Recent demand (P16-P19) shows even higher volatility and an average of ~118. To account for this growth and high variance, I will use a recent window for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 that captures this new regime. Specifically, N=10 captures the shift from Period 10 onwards. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level (80th percentile). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain using the 'default' method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift and increase in volatility starting from Period 10, as highlighted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand values (e.g., Period 16: 138, Period 18: 129, Period 20: 126) consistently exceed the initial average of ~77. We have experienced four stockouts in the last six periods (Periods 15, 16, 18, 20), indicating that the OR backend's default parameters (which incorporate early, lower-demand data) are under-ordering. To correct this, I am switching to 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to cover the entirety of the high-demand regime starting from Period 10 through Period 20. This will increase the base stock level to better handle the current higher average demand (approx. 105 in this regime) and its increased variability. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by all history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime (P10-P20): Average demand has risen to ~105 units (up from ~77), with frequent spikes above 125, necessitating higher safety stock levels.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned to a higher regime starting around Period 10, with a calculated average of approximately 105.8 units from Period 10 to Period 21. Recent spikes (Period 16: 138, Period 18: 129, Period 20: 126) indicate high volatility and a need for greater safety stock to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the history. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met across all periods (Actual Lead Time = 0). For Period 22, I will use recent history (N=12, covering the high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current mean of ~106 and accounts for the increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this higher demand profile. The service level target (critical ratio) remains high given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, favoring a slightly aggressive inventory position to avoid lost sales.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 105 units. Period 22 saw a significant drop (59), but given the historical peaks of 126, 129, and 138, this is treated as a low-variance fluctuation rather than a regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 15, 16, 18, and 20, I am using the last 13 periods (P10-P22) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current elevated mean (~102 including the P22 dip) and the high volatility observed in this regime. Lead time (L) is set to 0 as confirmed by all 22 history units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most notably a sustained increase starting at Period 10, with another volatility spike starting Period 16. In the last 14 periods (P10-P23), the average demand is approximately 101.5 units, significantly higher than the early-game average of ~77. Recent demand (P19-P23) shows values of 106, 126, 119, 59, and 102. The dip to 59 in Period 22 appears to be an outlier compared to the surrounding high-demand environment (~100-120 range). Using recent_N with N=14 captures this high-demand regime while smoothing out the recent outlier. Since actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will stick with the default lead time. The increased volatility (sigma_hat) will be handled by using the standard deviation of the same 14-period regime (N=14) to maintain an appropriate safety stock for the observed demand spikes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly increased since Period 10, with another sharp spike observed in the most recent period (P24: 136 units). We currently have zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit units, making this Period 25 order critical. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N window of 15 periods (starting from the shift in Period 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets an average demand of approximately 100-110 units while accounting for the high volatility (spikes >130) over the last 15 periods. The OR backend will calculate the optimal base stock using these parameters to maximize reward given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high in the current regime (P10-P24): Period 24 demand (136) confirms that ceiling-breaking spikes are still a significant risk to service levels.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new high-water mark, with Period 25 recording 166 units, a significant jump from the previous highs (~138). This confirms a deepening of the upward regime shift originally identified in Period 10. The system is currently in a state of chronic stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in 4 out of the last 6 periods). Profit is $4 vs Holding cost $1, justifying a high service level (0.80). Given the extreme volatility and the recent jump to 166, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the entire high-demand regime since P10) to capture the trend while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this volatile period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=16) to ensure the safety stock accounts for the increased variance seen in the latter half of the game history. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak: Period 25 demand reached 166 units, a ~20% increase over the previous regime high of 138, confirming sustained upward pressure on mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, with the most recent confirmed at Period 25 when demand peaked at 166. While Period 26 demand dropped to 91, the trend since Period 10 shows a clear upward trajectory in both mean and volatility. The average demand for the high-demand regime (P10-P26) is approximately 107.8 units, whereas the very recent volatility (P16-P26) shows frequent spikes above 130 (138, 129, 126, 136, 166). To maintain high service levels (critical given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio) and avoid the frequent stockouts seen in history, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=17 to capture the entire elevated regime starting at Period 10. For sigma_hat, I am using N=11 to specifically weigh the increased volatility and extreme spikes observed from Period 16 onwards. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime high confirmed: Period 26 demand (91) is a pullback from the Period 25 peak of 166, but the overall average since Period 10 remains elevated (~108), with frequent volatility spikes necessitating higher safety stock than the initial game samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a structural shift that began around Period 10, with high volatility and significant spikes (notably the 166 units in Period 25). The mean demand since Period 10 is approximately 108 units, but recent periods (P24-P27) have shown even greater variance. Period 27 demand was 105, following 91 and 166. To capture this sustained higher demand regime and its associated volatility, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the period from the known changepoint at Period 10 to now). This window appropriately captures the current regime's uplifted mean and the increased standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 has remained reliable throughout the game, so L is set to calculated. Standard base stock logic will target a service level determined by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.8), but the increased sigma_hat from recent samples will provide the necessary safety stock buffer to handle the frequent 125+ unit demand spikes seen in this regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 10) shows significantly higher mean and variance compared to the initial periods. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 28 is approximately 108 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 25 units, and a peak of 166 units in Period 25. Current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). I am using recent_N (N=19, covering the high-demand regime from P10-P28) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this shift and ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient service level to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, and 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-volatility, high-mean regime that started around Period 10. Period 29 demand (142) again exceeded local inventory, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is approximately 112.5 units, with a very high standard deviation (approx 31 units) driven by extreme spikes like Period 25 (166) and Period 29 (142). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened volatility and mean demand level. This will provide the OR backend with the necessary parameters to set a base stock that covers these frequent demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime from P10-P29 confirms an average of ~110 with frequent high-magnitude spikes (140-170), significantly exceeding early-game levels (~77). High volatility is sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime that began around Period 10. Recent demand points (P24: 136, P25: 166, P29: 142, P30: 132) confirm that demand frequently exceeds 130 per period. The average over the last 21 periods (P10-P30) is approximately 108.7, but because we are seeing frequent spikes, the standard deviation is also significant. I am setting N=21 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of this elevated regime while ignoring the lower-demand early game samples. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts during these recurrent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that established around Period 10 and intensified after Period 25. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 136, exceeding the starting inventory of 130 and resulting in a stockout. The average demand since Period 25 (the most recent peak/regime shift) is approximately 125.3 units, compared to the overall average since Period 10 which is ~110. Given the consistent presence of spikes between 130-166 units and the stockout in Period 31, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the most recent high-demand behavior (Periods 25-31). L remains at the promised lead time of 0 as all shipments have arrived same-period without delay. These parameters aim to maintain a high service level to capture profit from frequent demand spikes while managing the holding cost of units that might carry over during lower-demand periods (like Period 26 or 28).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P25-P31) with an average of ~125 units, representing a further increase from the P10-P24 average of ~102. Volatility remains high with a floor around 75 and peaks exceeding 140.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime. Since Period 25, demand has averaged approximately 123.3 units (166, 91, 105, 77, 142, 132, 136, 115) with high volatility and significant peaks. Period 32 demand was 115, which is consistent with this higher regime. The Promised Lead Time is 0, and historical observations (concluded periods 1-32) confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand/high-volatility behavior and ensure sufficient stock for potential spikes (profit $4 vs holding $1 suggests a high service level is optimal), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9, which covers the current regime since Period 24. This allows the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for the current environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime. Period 33 demand reached 158 units, following a trend identified in Carry-Over Insights where demand recently increased to a mean of ~125 (P25-P33). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the sustained upward pressure and frequent spikes above 140, I am using the most recent regime (P25-P33, N=9) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level capable of handling the current high-demand environment while acknowledging the 0-period lead time. Stockout in Period 33 (selling only 146 against 158 demand) confirms that inventory levels must remain aggressive to capture profit from these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand regime P25-P33 average is ~125. The Period 33 spike of 158 confirms that the 'ceiling' for demand continues to test previous maximums, maintaining the need for high safety stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-mean, high-volatility regime that stabilized around Period 25. Since Period 25, the average demand is approximately 119 units, with significant spikes (e.g., 166 in P25, 142 in P29, 136 in P31, 158 in P33) and pullbacks (e.g., 91 in P26, 77 in P28, 79 in P34). The current on-hand inventory is 71 units following a demand pullback in Period 34. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the strategy is to set mu_hat to cover this sustained higher average and maintain high sigma_hat to buffer against frequent spikes exceeding 140 units. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the most stable portion of this high-demand regime (P25-P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, demand was 112, with ending on-hand inventory at 35. The promised lead time continues to be 0, as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals throughout history. The demand regime from Period 25 to 35 shows an average of approximately 120 units but with high volatility (standard deviation ~28.5), including spikes up to 166. With a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, q=0.8), the backend needs to maintain a high service level. I will use the recent 11 periods (P25-P35) to capture this most recent sustained high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=11 aligns with the established regime duration while providing enough data to account for the current volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained high average compared to the early game. Since Period 25, the average demand is approximately 115 units, but with significant spikes (e.g., 158, 166) and recent lower values (57, 79). Period 36 demand was particularly low (57), leading to a high ending on-hand inventory of 88. However, given the history of regime shifts and ceiling-breaking spikes documented in carry-over insights, it is important to maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P25-P36) while smoothing out the very recent dip. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 25, with an average demand of approximately 112.5 units over the last 13 periods (P25-P37) and significant volatility, including peaks as high as 166. While the most recent period (P37) saw demand of 120, the average since Period 25 remains the most representative sample set for current behavior. Demand volatility remains high, with frequent shifts between ~60 and ~160. Setting recent_N to 13 for mu_hat captures this elevated regime average (~113). For sigma_hat, N=13 also captures the increased variance associated with this regime. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment, so I will continue using the default (promised) L.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. Since Period 25, the average demand is approximately 115 units, with frequent peaks reaching up to 166 (Period 25) and 158 (Period 33), and troughs as low as 57 (Period 36). The current on-hand inventory is 49. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to capture these spikes and avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game. I am choosing a recent_N window of 14 (from P25 to P38) to capture the current regime's mean and high variance, which will allow the base-stock policy to react appropriately to the sustained volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime P25-P38 average is approx 115 units with high volatility (StdDev approx 32). This confirms a sustained high-demand, high-variance state compared to the early game.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a high-volatility, high-demand regime that began significantly at Period 25. Analyzing the recent 15 periods (P25-P39), the average demand is approximately 115.8 units with a high standard deviation (approx 32). Period 39 demand (94) was slightly below this mean but consistent with the regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable (actual lead time has consistently been 0). To provide sufficient safety stock for the frequent spikes observed (e.g., 166 in P25, 158 in P33), I will continue to use the recent_N method. I've selected N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime since P25, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the elevated mean and volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. The most recent demand samples (P36-P40: 57, 120, 94, 94, 85) show a slight cooling from the extreme peaks of 150+, but still maintain an average significantly higher than the early game. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, necessitating a safety stock that accounts for frequent spikes. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. To capture the current regime's behavior while buffering against volatility, I am using a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat (covering the period from P25 onwards) and a recent_N of 16 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the increased variance observed in this stage of the game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 25. While the very recent demand (Periods 39-41: 94, 85, 88) has stabilized somewhat below the peak of 158 units seen in Period 33, the average since Period 25 remains approximately 115 units with significant upside risk. The Lead Time (L) is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while accounting for the frequent spikes (up to 166 units) observed in this regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the regime from Period 25 to 41). This allows the OR engine to capture both the elevated mean (~115) and the high standard deviation (~31) of the current high-demand state, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts experienced earlier in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P38-P42) shows a slight stabilization compared to the earlier high-volatility regime, with an average of approximately 87.6 units. This is lower than the previous regime average (approx. 115 in CARRY-OVER Period 39). However, previous history shows significant upward spikes (140-170 units), so safety stock must remain robust. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. I will shift the focus to the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) to capture this milder demand phase while maintaining enough sigma (volatility) coverage for the potential return of higher spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: Demand has tempered from the previous high of ~115 (P25-P38) to an average of ~88 (P39-P42), representing a ~23% decrease in the short term, though volatility remains present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 39. After a high-demand phase (P25-P38 average ~115), demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, for P39-P43, the demand values are 94, 85, 88, 77, and 75, resulting in an average of approximately 83.8 units per period. This represents a clear downshift from previous peaks. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (Period 39 to 43). This aligns the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the currently observed lower mean and variance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed at Period 39: Average demand has decreased from ~115 (P25-P38) to ~84 (P39-P43), a reduction of approx 27%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 39. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 85 units (94, 85, 88, 77, 75, 91), which is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~115). I am using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower mean and reduced (but still present) volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the game history, so I am using the default (promised) setting. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no in-transit units, the OR engine will place an order to meet the base stock requirements for this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 39. Between Periods 39 and 45, the average demand is approximately 90 units (94, 85, 88, 77, 75, 91, 116), a significant decrease from the previous regime's average of ~115 (P25-P38). The Period 45 demand spike to 116 suggests that while the mean has dropped, volatility remains high. Period 44 and 45 ended with 0 on-hand inventory, indicating the 'safe' base stock levels computed by the OR engine are slightly too low for the current volatility. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the P39-P45 regime) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture this specific volatility and the new mean. Lead time L=0 remains consistent throughout the history.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 39 (averaging ~84 units), but Periods 45 and 46 show a potential rebound or increased volatility (116 and 102 units). My previous carry-over insight from Period 44 noted a reduction, but recent demand suggests we are currently in an intermediate phase or experiencing a slight upward volatility spike. Given that Periods 44, 45, and 46 have resulted in zero ending inventory (stocking out or just meeting demand), I need to increase safety stock to prevent lost sales. I am using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the post-P39 behavior while weighting the recent rebound. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 8 to capture the current volatility environment, which remains significant even as the mean has shifted from the P25-P38 peak. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/transition at Period 45: After a downshift starting P39 (avg ~84), demand in P45-P46 (avg 109) suggests either a new upward shift or a return to high volatility, causing stockouts in consecutive periods.

Demand in the last three periods (P45-P47) was 116, 102, and 91, resulting in an average of 103 units. This transition caused stockouts in Periods 45 and 46 because the previous order quantities (based on the downshift) were insufficient. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, meaning we must lean towards covering these higher spikes. Given that we are entering the final periods of the game (Period 48 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover this renewed volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since Period 39, reflecting both the downshift and the recent rebound, which provides a balanced forecast of approximately 91 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 45-47 (avg 103) confirms that the downshift observed at Period 39 (avg 82) was temporary or represents a highly volatile floor; inventory levels must adjust upward to prevent further stockouts in high-volatility cycles.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear rebound starting at Period 45. After a downshift (P39-P44) where demand averaged ~84, the last four periods (P45-P48) have seen demand rise to an average of 108.25 (116, 102, 91, 124). This has resulted in several stockouts (P45, P46, P48) because the inventory was positioned for the lower demand regime. With Period 49 being the penultimate period, and Period 50 being the end, I must set the forecast to capture this higher demand regime to maximize sales. I will use recent_N with N=4 to focus on this latest rebound phase. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the demand history shows a recent rebound from the downshift (P39-P44, avg ~83) to a more volatile and higher average state starting around P45. The average demand from P45 to P49 is approximately 102.6 units (116, 102, 91, 124, 80). Looking at the overall history, the system has transitioned through several regimes: early game (~77), mid-game high (~125), a temporary dip (~83), and the current rebound (~103). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. With profit at $4.0 and holding cost at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a high service level. Given the high volatility observed in the last 5 periods (std dev approx 17.5) and the recent stockouts in P45, P46, and P48, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the current 'rebound' regime's mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent average of ~103 while reflecting the high dispersion to maintain safety stock against potential spikes back toward the 120+ range seen in P48.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P45-P49) stabilized at an average of ~103 units, confirming the end of the P39-P44 downshift and a return to moderate-to-high volatility with spikes up to 124.
