Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive during Period 1 and be available for customers, though confirmation only appears in the Period 2 start message. Demand Analysis: Historical data shows samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The mean is 85.8 with a standard deviation of 25.6. Period 5 showed a significant jump to 126 (+47% over mean), which might indicate an upward trend or a specific event. OR Recommendation: The OR proposes 108 units. Given the high profit ($4) vs low holding cost ($1) and the recent spike in demand, the OR's recommendation of 108 is reasonable as it covers the mean plus significant safety stock.

  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Confirmed actual lead time is 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). This has been consistent throughout the history.\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Period 48 ended with 1 unit on-hand. Demand in Period 48 was 124 units. Looking at the recent stable regime (Periods 44-48), demand has been {91, 116, 102, 91, 124}, averaging 104.8 units. The long-term trend from the Carry-Over Insights shows the mean hovering around 93-100 units recently, but the last period saw a spike.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 1 unit. There is no in-transit inventory because the lead time is 0.\n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 119 units based on historical data. Given the 0-period lead time, the inventory position needs to cover only Period 49's demand. \n5. **Adjustment**: Current volatility is moderate. A target stock level of ~125-130 units (similar to Period 48's starting inventory) balances the profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1). Since I have 1 unit, ordering 124 units brings me to 125. The OR recommendation of 119 units would result in a starting inventory of 120, which is slightly risky if demand spikes toward the 130s seen earlier.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The inventory system currently has 45 units on hand. Historical data over the last few periods show a slight upward trend in mean demand, moving from approximately 93 units to 105 units. Most recently, Period 48 saw demand of 124 units, followed by 80 units in Period 49. The Actual Lead Time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, the target stock level (order + on-hand) should cover the upper range of recent demand. Given the recent average of ~105 and a recent peak of 124, a total inventory of approximately 130 units is appropriate. The OR recommendation of 75 units, when added to the current 45 units on hand, results in a total of 120 units. This is slightly conservative given the recent demand of 124, so I will adjust the order slightly upward to 85 units to reach a total availability of 130 units.",
