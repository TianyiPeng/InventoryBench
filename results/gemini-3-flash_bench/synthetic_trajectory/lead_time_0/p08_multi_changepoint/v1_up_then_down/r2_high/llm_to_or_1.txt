Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). The historical data shows demand starting high (130, 122) and then declining (106, 108, 71). The mean of the provided 5 samples is 107.4. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods, an order placed now will arrive within this period and satisfy Period 1 demand. To ensure we don't stock out while acknowledging the recent downward trend (especially the 71 in Period 5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand profile without overreacting to the single low point. Since we have no lead time history yet, L remains 'default'.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 145 units arrived immediately (lead time 0), satisfying demand of 118 units and leaving 27 on hand. The actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0. Historical demand across 5 periods (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) shows a downward trend, with recent values dropping significantly below the mean of 107.4. Given the drop in Period 5 of the historical data and the observed Period 1 demand of 118 (which is slightly higher but still moderate), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the more recent demand volatility and mean while accounting for the current stock level. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for Period 2, considering the 27 units already on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 105 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 118 and 35, averaging 76.5 units. The promised lead time is 0, and the logic of L=0 is confirmed by the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1 and 2, which showed arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (95%), requiring a robust base stock. However, demand dropped significantly in Period 2 compared to Period 1. I will use a conservative approach by averaging the first two periods of demand (N=2) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default promised value of 0. This ensures the OR engine calculates a target level based on the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2626.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Period 1 to Period 3 confirm that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand has shown significant volatility: P1 (118), P2 (35), P3 (140), and users' historical samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The average demand across all 8 available data points is approximately 103.75 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is consistently 0. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent samples and the game history, balancing the low demand in P2 with the high demand in P3. For \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the high variance observed in the recent data (ranging from 35 to 140).

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Periods 1-4 confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility in the concluding periods (118, 35, 140, 30), suggesting a potential alternating pattern or high randomness rather than a stable mean. However, the cumulative demand samples provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) show a decreasing trend in the most recent periods. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent downward trend in demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2460.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, for chips(Regular), we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the first 5 periods (arrivals occur within the same period as orders). Demand has been highly volatile, with samples: 118, 35, 140, 30, and 131. The mean demand is approximately 90.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 55.4 units. Although the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (130, 122, ..., 71) differs slightly from the 'Game History' (118, 35, ...), the Game History is the actionable reality. There is no clear trend or seasonal anchor provided by calendar dates yet (only generic Period_X labels). I am using 'calculate' for lead time as the evidence supports L=0. I will use all 5 available Game History samples (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility while providing enough stock to cover the roughly 1:19 cost-to-profit ratio (q=0.95 service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1280.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-6) confirm an actual lead time of 0 consistently. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is highly volatile, fluctuating between 30 and 140 units. The mean demand over the first 6 periods is 87.8, with a standard deviation of 48.7. Currently, we have 107 units on-hand. Since L=0, the review period is 1 period (current period demand). I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance while maintaining a steady average. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high variability (high sigma) to avoid stockouts while recognizing the zero lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals from Period 1 to 7 confirm that actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 64. Demand has shown significant variability over the first 7 periods (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104), with an average of approximately 90.1 units per period and a high standard deviation. There is no clear trend or seasonal signal from the limited period data. Because demand is volatile and lead time is zero, I will use all available samples (N=7 for demand statistics, though the backend default uses all history) to calculate the base stock. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 0-period lead time and using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history for stable parameter estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand shows high variance with no clear seasonal trend established in the first 8 periods (ranging from 30 to 140). The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 87 units. Given the high volatility (std dev ~42) and the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a higher service level is naturally targeted by the backend's base-stock formula. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent history since the system started, allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for this level of volatility.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility across the first 9 periods, with values ranging from 30 to 140. Using all available data from Period 1 to Period 9, the mean demand is approximately 89.78 units/period, and the standard deviation is approximately 39.54. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There are no overdue shipments or in-transit inventory. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full recent history of this inventory cycle, ensuring the base stock level (target inventory) is calculated based on these recent performance metrics to guard against the observed high variance while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1903.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods has shown significant volatility without a clear trend or seasonal shift, oscillating between 30 and 140 units. The mean demand across Periods 1-10 is 91.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 36.5. This follows the initial historical samples provided (range 71-130). The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which matches the promised lead time. Since there is no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time drift, I am using the 'default' method for L (0) and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent variability while maintaining a stable average. The inventory position is currently 54 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods will allow the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the high variance (low z-score but high sigma) relative to the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1765.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 11 periods. The mean demand across Periods 1-11 is approximately 91.5 units, which is slightly lower than the initial historical samples. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the backend logic naturally targets a high service level (~95%). Since there are no seasonal dates or product descriptions to suggest a future shift, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the stabilization of the mean and variance observed in the active game history (Periods 1-11). Using N=11 (the full game history) provides a more stable estimate than the much noisier early historical data. No missing shipments or lead-time drifts are observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Periods 1-11 with an average of ~92 units per period (compared to early samples). Lead time confirmed consistently at 0 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision context: Current on-hand inventory is 92. Historical demand for periods 1-12 averages 88.9 units (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64, 113, 103, 96, 60). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. The last few periods (8-12) show a mean demand of 87.2, suggesting a stable regime slightly lower than the initial samples provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71 - mean 107.4). I will use a recent window of N=12 (incorporating all available game performance data) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine reflects the actual observed performance rather than the seeding samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1071.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a softening trend over the last few periods (Periods 12-13: 60, 61), significantly lower than the previous regime average of ~92 units. While it is too early to declare a permanent regime shift (only 2 periods of data), the historical demand is quite volatile (range 30-140). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent lower observations while maintaining safety stock against historical volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to cover the entirety of the game history visible in the 'conclude' messages. This allows the OR backend to incorporate the recent lower demand points into the average without overreacting prematurely.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1514.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the first 14 periods, with a mean around 87-90 units. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show an average demand of 68 units, whereas the period before P11 showed a higher average. Checking specifically the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the mean demand is 80.6 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 63. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level (approx 95%) is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the broader stabilized regime while allowing the most recent, slightly lower demand periods to weigh in. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the current variance environment. L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with a mean around 87 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P12-P15) show a slight increase in volatility compared to P11, with demand values resulting in an average of 75. Since the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met as confirmed by the game history (all orders arrive in the same period), I will maintain L=0. I am choosing recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most representative recent demand distribution (covering Periods 6 through 15) while smoothing out the noise from the very high-demand early periods (P1, P3, P5) and the lower-demand middle periods. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 178 units, which is much higher than the previous average of ~92 units. This caused a stockout (sold 118, target 178, ending inventory 0). Given this sudden increase and the fact lead time is 0, I need to adjust the forecast to account for this higher volatility and potential demand shift. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend in demand more aggressively than the long-term average, as the last two periods (96 and 178) suggest a departure from the previous stable regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 16 (178 units), following a period of stability (~90 units). Monitor for a sustained higher regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3184.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 and 17, demand spiked significantly to 178 and 168 units respectively, compared to the previous average of ~92 units. This indicates a clear demand regime shift or a strong seasonal effect. Stockouts occurred in Period 16, and ending inventory in Period 17 is very low (8 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this higher demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand state (average ~173) and its volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent further lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from ~92 to ~173 (+88%) over Periods 16-17. Initial volatility is high.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent three periods (P16: 178, P17: 168, P18: 155), the average demand is 167 units, which is a nearly 85% increase over the previous regime average (~90). This higher demand has been sustained for three consecutive periods, justifying a focused forecast. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the current peak demand while accounting for the high reward/holding cost ratio (19:1), which encourages maintaining higher stock to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2094.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting around Period 16. Previous data stabilized at ~92 units, but the average of the last four periods (16-19) is approximately 153.75 units (178, 168, 155, 114). While Period 19 showed a dip to 114, it remains higher than the pre-shift average. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages. Given the recent variability and the shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the new demand level (N=4 corresponds to the start of the detected regime shift at Period 16). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that prioritizes meeting this higher demand while adjusting for the recent variance.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~92 units. From Period 16 to Period 20, demand has averaged 152 units (178, 168, 155, 114, 145). Although Period 19 was slightly lower (114), the overall trend remains much higher than the initial regime. I will use the last 5 periods (Period 16-20) as the window for recent_N to capture this higher mean and the associated increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), justifying a high service level which the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally provide given these updated parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2427.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand values were [178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 148.5 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the pre-Period 16 average of ~92. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand level and its associated volatility, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to isolate the new regime. This allows the base stock calculation to maintain a high service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~95%) while reflecting the current market reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level post-Period 16: mean ~148.5 units (Periods 16-21) compared to the previous ~92 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3272.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 16-22), the mean demand is 152.0 units per period (178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173). The standard deviation in this window is approximately 22 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system should target a high service level (0.95 quantile). Using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while ignoring the lower demand of Periods 1-15. This approach ensures the base stock reflects current consumption patterns and covers the expected demand for the current period, which occurs after the decision phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further post-Period 16: Periods 16-22 mean increased slightly to ~152 units (up from ~148.5 reported in P22) with sustained volatility (std ~22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2409.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted established stability since Period 16. In the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged 149.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. The most recent period (P23) saw demand of 130, and the previous (P22) was 173, confirming the sustained higher level compared to the pre-P16 average of ~92. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this new regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using 8 periods provides a balance between responsiveness to the shift and statistical smoothing to avoid over-ordering on transient spikes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new, higher regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 148.8 units [(178+168+155+114+145+131+173+130+145)/9]. The standard deviation in this period (N=9) is approximately 20.8. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (43 units), and the order placed this period (Period 25) arrives before Period 25's demand resolution, setting parameters based on this recent regime (N=9) will optimize the base stock to meet current demand levels while balancing the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-24 confirmed stable at mean ~149 (std ~21), 62% higher than the P1-P15 average (~92).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (N=10), the mean is 148.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this stable, higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=10 focuses on the most relevant historical data following the changepoint identified at Period 16. This provides the OR backend with an accurate baseline for the current demand environment while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, following a significant upward shift from the initial pre-Period 15 average of ~92 units. The most recent demand samples (P16-P26) show a stable mean of approximately 149 units (Mean P16-P26 = 149.5, Std Dev = 20.3). Period 26 demand was 163 units, confirming the higher regime persists. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture specifically this higher demand regime that began at Period 16. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer appropriate for the current volatility, maximizing profit while managing holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 27 (the latest 12 periods), the average demand is approximately 148.5 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 18.5. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the demand has stabilized at this higher level for over 10 periods, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand mean and volatility while ignoring the significantly lower demand from periods 1-15.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Since Period 16, the demand has averaged approximately 146.3 units per period (Periods 16-28), compared to the prior average of ~92. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand level while accounting for the recent stability in this new regime, I am using a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering the period since the shift began) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the appropriate base stock level for the current environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3401.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained elevated. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 147.8 units, compared to the earlier average of ~92. Recent demand shows significant volatility, peaking at 187 in P29, which depleted ending inventory to zero. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am using recent_N=14 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput and current level of uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-29 remains stable at mean ~148, but exhibits higher volatility peaks (max 187 in P29). Inventory ended at 0 in P29 due to a demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1914.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the most recent stable regime (Periods 16-30), the average demand is approximately 147 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21 units. However, there has been periodic higher-than-average volatility, such as the demand of 187 in Period 29 which resulted in a stockout. Period 30 saw a lower demand of 105, leaving us with 81 units on hand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend's default base-stock logic (using profit/(profit+holding_cost) \u2248 0.95 quantile) is appropriate. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the mean and variance of this current high-demand regime (Periods 16-30) while excluding the previous low-demand baseline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~92 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 16-31, N=16), the mean demand is approximately 144 units with a standard deviation of ~28. Although the last two periods (P30: 105, P31: 88) show a slight dip, it is not yet clear if this is a sustained downward shift or just standard volatility within the current high-demand regime. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this post-shift regime while maintaining enough history to buffer against the observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous arrivals in the 'conclude' messages.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level compared to the earlier periods. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 32, the mean is approximately 144 units per period with a standard deviation of about 24. While Periods 30 and 31 showed a slight dip (105 and 88 units), Period 32 returned to the established regime (144 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is critical. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the demand behavior since the changepoint in Period 16. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to use for 'L'. Inventory is currently at 44 units with no in-transit orders, necessitating an order to cover the next period's expected demand and safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2673.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, following a shift upwards from an earlier average of ~92 to a current average of ~145. Recent periods (P30-P33) show demand values of 105, 88, 144, and 143. While P31 and P32 were slightly lower, the overall mean since the Period 16 changepoint is approximately 144.6 with a standard deviation of 25.4. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in history. To capture the current demand regime accurately while allowing for the observed volatility (max 187 in P29), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the period since the shift at P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the higher demand level and provides sufficient safety stock for the frequent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3534.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level ever since. For Periods 16-34, the mean demand is approximately 146.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. In the most recent period (P34), demand spiked to 191, resulting in zero ending inventory. This indicates the need for a sufficiently high base stock to cover demand peaks. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this higher demand regime over the last 19 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (matching the start of the regime at P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the lower pre-Period 16 data. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at its promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-34 stable at mean ~146 with a high standard deviation (~28.5). Observed frequent spikes near or exceeding 180 units (P16, P29, P34), which periodically deplete on-hand inventory.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with a Mean of approximately 145 units and a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. We observed recent high demand spikes (P29: 187, P34: 191) which led to stockouts. By Period 35, demand was 134, and the current on-hand inventory is 57. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the higher volatility (periodic spikes > 180) and to avoid further stockouts, I will use a window of the last 20 periods (P16-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the upper tail of this distribution.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 144 units and a standard deviation of about 27. Period 36 showed a lower demand of 94 units, but this remains within the expected range of volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime characteristics (stable mean with intermittent high spikes), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21, covering the period since the regime shift at Period 16. This provides the OR backend with a localized estimate of the current demand level and its historical volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock against spikes that have previously depleted inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 144 units and significant volatility (std ~29). Recent demand in Periods 36 and 37 has been lower (94 and 91 respectively) compared to the long-term average, but given the high historical variance and frequent spikes (e.g., Period 34 demand was 191), it is premature to assume a downward shift. I will use the recent regime (Period 16 to 37) to calculate parameters, setting N=22. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this 22-period regime, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for both the average demand and the frequent high-demand spikes to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has been characterized by a higher mean (~146) but high volatility. However, the last three periods (P36-P38) have shown a significant downward trend with demands of 94, 91, and 75, which are well below the post-P16 average and even below the long-term average. This could indicate a new downward shift or a temporary lull. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the optimal service level remains high (q \u2248 0.95), suggesting we should protect against stockouts even if demand is currently low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent high-demand regime while beginning to incorporate the latest deceleration. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand deceleration observed in Periods 36-38 (mean ~87) compared to the Period 16-35 average (~146). Monitoring to see if this lower regime sustains.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1166.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear deceleration over the last four periods (P36-P39), with demand values of 94, 91, 75, and 68. This is a significant departure from the previous Period 16-35 average of approximately 146. The mean of these most recent four periods is 82, which aligns with the earliest historical regime (P1-P15 avg ~92) rather than the mid-game spike. Given this consistent downward trend over 4 periods, I am shifting the forecast models to focus on this new lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this new mean (mu_hat) and to account for the reduced volatility (sigma_hat) associated with lower volume, which will prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand decreased from ~146 (P16-P35) to ~82 (P36-P39), representing a ~44% drop. Volatility has also decreased.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first noted in Period 39 and confirmed in Period 40 is sustained. In the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has been 94, 91, 75, 68, and 75, resulting in a mean of approximately 80.6 units\u2014a significant drop from the ~146 units seen in the P16-P35 window. Volatility has also decreased (standard deviation ~11.5). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Given the new stable lower demand, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (Periods 36-40). I am also using lead time 'calculate' to reflect the stable L=0 observed throughout the history. With 51 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend will calculate the order based on this updated lower forecast to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 36-40 stable at mean ~81 (std ~12), confirming the ~45% reduction from the previous high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 41, demand has averaged 85.2 units (94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108), following a long period of ~146 units. Period 41 ended with 0 inventory because the order placed in Period 40 was 0 and demand was slightly higher (108). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this lower demand regime (P36-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using EWMA or default would overweight the previous high-demand period. Setting L method to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-period lead time observed in history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 36 onwards) remains stable at a lower level compared to the Period 16-35 peak. Demand samples from Period 36 to 42 are: 94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95. The mean for these 7 periods is approximately 86.5 with a standard deviation of 13.9. Although Period 41 saw a slight stockout due to a previous Period 40 'zero order' decision (likely the OR backend's cap or logic), the actual demand (108) was consistent with the current lower regime's upper range. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend aligns with current trends. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 36 and has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P36-P43). The mean demand in this new regime is approximately 85 units (sum: 94+91+75+68+75+108+95+74 = 680 / 8 = 85), with a standard deviation of approximately 14. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime of ~146. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this new, lower-demand, lower-volatility regime to prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 36 and has stabilized. For Periods 36-44, the mean demand is approximately 82.3 units with a standard deviation of roughly 15.2. Recent periods (43-44) show slightly lower demand (74, 62), but given the historical volatility, keeping N=9 for the most recent stable regime (since P36) provides the most reliable statistical base. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 46 units. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime accurately for the OR backend, ensuring we maintain a high service level for the $19 margin while minimizing holding costs on the lower baseline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36 and has remained stable through Period 45. For the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 79.7 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Although previous periods (P16-P35) saw higher demand (~146), the current regime is consistent and significantly lower. Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this current stability while allowing for recent variability (e.g., the 108 unit demand in P41). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 53, and a lead time of 0 allows for immediate replenishment to meet the current period's demand. The service level target (critical ratio) is high (~95%) given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 36. Since Period 36, the average demand (P36-P46) is approximately 79.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. The most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) show an even lower mean of ~67.2 units, indicating a possible further downward drift or just natural variation in this lower regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 58 units. To optimize for the current regime, I will apply the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=11 (the length of the current stable regime since P36) and set lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36 and has remained relatively stable since. From Period 36 to Period 47 (12 periods), the mean demand is approximately 80 units per period (sum of demands P36-P47 is 960; 960/12 = 80). The standard deviation for this period is approximately 18.2. Although recent demand peaked slightly at 108 (P41) and 68 (P47), the overall trend is a lower, more stable regime compared to the mid-game peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period except P40 (where no order was placed). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 36, decreasing from an average of ~146 to a new stabilized mean of approximately 77.8 units per period (Periods 36-48). The last 5 periods (44-48) show an even lower average of 63.4 units, though the demand rebounded slightly to 82 in Period 48. Given the game is at Period 49 out of 50, the primary goal is to cover the final two periods of demand (P49 and P50) while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 13 (covering the start of the lower regime at Period 36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which accurately reflects the current lower demand level while accounting for recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1355.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 36 following a significant drop. Over the most recent 14 periods (P36-P49), the mean demand is approximately 79.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This is a consistent and sustained shift from the high-demand regime of P16-P35. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. For Period 50, I will use a recent_N approach (N=14) to capture this stable, lower-demand regime while accounting for the current volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current mean (~79) and variance, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost effectively without over-ordering based on the older, higher demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 36-49 stabilized at mean ~79 (std ~16.5), maintaining the ~45% reduction from the previous high-demand period with lower absolute volatility.
