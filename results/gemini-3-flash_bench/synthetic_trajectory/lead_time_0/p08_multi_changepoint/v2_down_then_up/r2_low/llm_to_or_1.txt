Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical 'conclude' messages yet to infer actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 0. Based on the provided demand history (Periods 1-5), the demand shows a downward trend (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). Given we are starting at Period 1 with 0 inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. Calculation: Mean of samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) is 93.8. Standard deviation is approximately 16.9. With L=0, mu_hat should be approximately (1+0)*93.8 and sigma_hat approx (sqrt(1+0)*16.9). Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 1/(1+1) = 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use the 'default' method for all parameters to allow the backend to use all available prior samples for initial safety stock calculation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 94 units with an observed lead time of 0 periods (arrived immediately). Demand was 56, leaving 38 units on hand. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the average demand is 93.8 with a standard deviation of 17.2. However, the first actual game period demand was 56, which is lower than the historical range. Since we only have one game observation, I will use a larger sample set (N=5) to smooth the forecast while we gather more data. I'll set L=0 as confirmed by the Period 1 conclusion.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, valid demand was 56 and the order of 94 arrived instantly (L=0). In Period 2, on-hand (38) plus arrival (48) was 86, but demand was 98, resulting in 12 units of lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. The average demand over the provided 5 periods is 93.8. Since L=0 is confirmed by history, I will use L=0. I will set mu_hat to be slightly higher than the average demand to recover from the stockout and cater to the variability seen in Period 2 (98) and Period_2's sample (113). Using the mean of the 5 historical samples (93.8) for 1+L periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in-transit. Demand has shown a significant upward trend (56 -> 98 -> 137). However, the initial historical demand sample set (provided in the prompt) lists Period 1-3 as 95, 113, 106. Reconciling this: the actual demand observed in the game history (56, 98, 137) is highly volatile and currently increasing. In Period 2 and 3, we experienced stockouts (sold < demand, ending inventory = 0). I will use the recent history (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture this upward trend and higher volatility. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~97) with L=0 will allow the base stock to adjust. Given the high volatility and stockout history, I will keep sigma_hat at recent_N to ensure a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upwards with high volatility (56, 98, 137 in Periods 1-3). Current stockouts occurred in Period 2 and 3 due to under-ordering relative to realized demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility in the first 5 periods (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). Note: The sample data provided in the prompt (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) differs from the narrative game history provided (56, 98, 137, 82). Based on the formal 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the manual section (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the demand appears to be mean-reverting or slightly declining after an initial peak, with an average of approximately 93.8. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (W=0) has consistently matched this. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime and ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 15, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with values of 56, 98, 137, 82, and 111 (average 96.8). In the most recent period (P5), we stocked out again because demand (111) exceeded the available stock (89), which was composed of starting inventory plus the same-period order. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the ending inventory for Period 5 is 0 and there are no units in transit, we enter Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, which corresponds to the median (z*=0). However, the system's stockout history suggests we need to be more aggressive to satisfy demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and its significant volatility, ensuring the base stock level better covers potential high-demand outcomes.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile around an average of 97 units; stockouts occurred in 3 of 5 periods (P2, P3, P5) due to high demand spikes. Lead time consistently confirmed as 0.

Daily Profit: $97.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is highly volatile and frequently exceeds current inventory, resulting in stockouts in 4 out of 6 periods (P2, P3, P5, P6). The actual demand reached a peak of 167 in Period 6, while the previous average was around 97. The lead time is consistently 0. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5. However, since the system repeatedly stocks out, the standard mu_hat based on past sales significantly underestimates true demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the upward trend and volatility, but apply an 'explicit' value for mu_hat to account for the suppressed demand in stockout periods. Based on the demand samples (56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167), the mean is 108.5. To ensure we capture the upside of the volatility and prevent further stockouts, I will set mu_hat at 115 and use calculated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility is extreme, with a significant spike to 167 in Period 6. Stockouts in 66% of periods (4/6) indicate that historical 'sold' units are not a reliable proxy for true 'demand'. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $115.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are facing chronic stockouts. In 5 out of 7 periods, the ending inventory was 0, meaning 'sold' units (reflected in provided historical demand) are significantly undercounting true latent demand. Period 7 saw 'sold' at 115 but demand at 135; Period 6 saw 'sold' at 97 but demand at 167. The last three periods of demand were 111, 167, and 135 (avg 137.7). Because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, which is too low given the high penalty of stockouts (missed profit). I will use the 'explicit' method to force a higher base stock. Given lead time is 0 (L=0), I need to cover Period 8 demand. I estimate mean demand at 140. To account for volatility and prevent another stockout, I will set mu_hat to 150 (explicit) and increase sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high variance observed since Period 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout regime: Demand has exceeded supply in 5/7 periods. Latent demand is significantly higher than historical mean; average demand over last 3 periods is 137.7 compared to initial levels around 80. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand has been consistently high, leading to stockouts in 6 out of 8 periods. While Period 8 finally ended with positive inventory (22 units), the average demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is high at 143.3 units (167, 135, 128). The earlier periods (P1-P5) averaged significantly lower. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given profit and holding costs are equal, a service level targeting roughly 50% through the base stock formula is the OR default, but the policy cap will provide safety), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime. Lead time is definitively 0 based on consistent 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period). Setting L to 0 ensures we order what is needed for the current period's resolution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: average demand from P6 to P8 is 143.3 units, compared to ~95 units in earlier periods. Stockouts frequent when supply is below 130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 38. Looking at the history, demand has transitioned into a higher regime. From Period 6 through Period 9, the actual demand values were 167, 135, 128, and 106. The mean of these four periods is approximately 134 units. However, previous periods were plagued by stockouts where 'sold' units were less than 'demand' (e.g., Period 6 sold 97 while demand was 167), meaning my historical mean is likely biased downward. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. Since the lead time (L) is consistently 0, the OR backend's order calculation will target the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) for the current period. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the engine will aim to stock the mean. I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this regime (std dev of 167, 135, 128, 106 is ~25.5, but I'll round up to 30 to reflect the uncertainty of latent demand).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent 5 periods (Period 6 to Period 10), demand values are 167, 135, 128, 106, and 114. The average demand during this period is 130.0 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 20 units. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target a base stock roughly at the median of the demand distribution (z* \u2248 0). To ensure we capture this higher demand regime and prevent the return of the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 2-7, I am selecting recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current stabilized higher-demand level rather than the lower initial periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher since Period 6: Avg ~130 units (P6-P10) compared to ~95 in P1-P5. Volatility remains significant (\u03c3 \u2248 23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the demand regime has shifted slightly lower over the last three periods (P9-P11: 106, 114, 108) compared to the preceding high-demand burst in P6-P8 (167, 135, 128). However, historical stockouts (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7) indicate that demand often exceeds 130 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To avoid unnecessary holding costs while protecting against the volatility seen in earlier periods, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime (P6-P11). This provides a \u03bc\u0302 of approximately 126 and accounts for the high historical variance to ensure the base stock is resilient to spikes while avoiding the excessive overstocking that might occur if using only the most recent three lower demand samples.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct regime shift starting around Period 6. From P1-P5, demand averaged approximately 97 units. From P6-P12, the average demand increased to approximately 125.6 units (167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108, 121). Although the last 4 periods (P9-P12) show a slight cooling (avg ~112), the standard deviation since the regime change is approximately 19.8. I will use a N=7 window (P6-P12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), so the base stock policy should trigger an order of approximately 120-130 units to cover the current period's demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, we observed a significant drop in demand to 68 units, which is a major outlier compared to the 110-140 range seen in the recent 'high' regime (P6-P12). However, one sample doesn't confirm a regime shift back to lower levels. On-hand inventory is 58 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering P6-P13) to account for the high-demand regime while including the recent low outlier, which brings the mean for (1+L) to roughly 110-115. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to capture the high volatility introduced by the recent fluctuation (from 121 to 68). The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on a 50% service level target (since profit = holding cost = $1), ordering just enough to reach the target after considering the 58 units on hand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a regime shift around Period 6. From P1-P5, the average demand was approximately 96.8. From P6-P14, the average demand increased to approximately 119.8, despite a significant dip in Period 13 (68 units). There have been frequent stockouts (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7), indicating that 'sold' units often under-represent true demand. I will focus on the most recent regime (P6-P14) to capture the higher mean and volatility. Using N=9 (P6 through P14) for mu_hat captures this current level (approx 120/period). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. Since Period 13 and 14 showed slightly lower demand than the P6-P8 peak, a focus on the last 9 periods balances the recent high-demand history with the slightly more moderate recent observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has shifted downward to an average of 96.8 units (108, 121, 68, 106, 81), which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~130 units. Additionally, the standard deviation in this recent window has increased due to the high variance (specifically P13 and P15). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels given the recent volatility, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but more volatile demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: average demand decreased from ~130 to ~97 units (last 5 periods). Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 59 units. Demand analysis over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) shows a mean of 82.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 33 units. This represents a significant decline from the P6-P11 average of ~130 units, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Period 16 specifically saw a very low demand of 38 units. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock (mu_hat) should align closely with the expected demand. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent lower demand regime, allowing the system to adjust downward and avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent average demand levels. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third distinct regime. After a high-demand period (P6-P10 avg ~130) and a subsequent moderate period (P11-P15 avg ~97), the last two periods (P16-P17) show a significant decline in demand (38 and 62, average 50). Using a recent_N approach with N=7 captures the shift from the moderate regime (avg ~97) into this lower demand phase (avg ~77 over the last 7 periods: 108, 121, 68, 106, 81, 38, 62). Stock levels have been healthy, with no stockouts since Period 7. The lead time is stable at 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), resulting in a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1+1)). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to adapt quickly to the recent lower demand trend while maintaining some historical volatility context.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand significantly softened, averaging 77 units over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) compared to ~130 in earlier peak periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), demand has significantly cooled, averaging 77.5 units, which is a departure from the earlier peak of ~130. Looking even more closely at the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18), the average demand is 64.6 units. This suggests a sustained lower demand regime compared to the early game history. To avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs (which equal profit per unit), I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling trend. The Lead Time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods, which simplifies the pipeline logic. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to align volatility estimates with the current demand level. The carry-over insight records this sustained lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level since P14: average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 64.6 units, significantly lower than the P6-P10 average of ~130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand has been 81, 38, 62, 36, and 25, averaging approximately 48.4 units per period. This is a sharp decline from the earlier peak average of ~130 and the subsequent mid-level average of ~97. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, which almost covers the recent average demand. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the optimal base stock (z=0) is the mean. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this downward shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend targets the new lower mean while accounting for recent variance to prevent excessive inventory costs in this low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 20: average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has dropped to 48.4 units, compared to the P11-P15 average of ~97.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. Starting around Period 16, demand levels dropped from previous averages of ~130 to significantly lower levels. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has been 38, 62, 36, 25, and 58, resulting in a mean of 43.8 units. The stockout in Period 20 (starting inventory 58, demand 58) indicates that even at these lower levels, demand can spike occasionally. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower volume regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent volatility (25 to 58 spike). This approach balances the lower average demand with the risk of stockouts seen in Period 20.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 16. Demand for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) averaged 48 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 16 units. However, Period 21 experienced a stockout (demand 59, sold 44), suggesting that demand may be stabilizing or slightly rebounding from the recent lows. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1 each), the optimal service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while ensuring we provide enough inventory to satisfy the mean demand of the last 5 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization at a much lower level compared to the middle periods of the game. For Period 23, we observe that demand in P20, P21, and P22 was 58, 59, and 57 respectively, which is remarkably consistent. However, the last two periods (P21, P22) resulted in stockouts because the supply (starting inventory) was capped at the arriving order amount (44 and 48), while true demand was slightly higher (~58). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To better meet this current demand level while accounting for the high unit profit/holding cost ratio (1:1 implies a target service level q = 0.5), I will use the recent 3 periods (P20-P22) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent regime where demand averaged ~58 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 58 units (P20-P22 avg: 58.0) following a long decline from earlier peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a long decline and is now showing signs of a slight recovery or stabilization at a higher level than the recent low of 48 units. Demand in the last four periods (P20-P23) was 58, 59, 57, and 72, averaging approximately 61.5 units. The stockouts in P21, P22, and P23 indicate that the current ordering strategy is underestimating true demand. Specifically, in P23, demand jumped to 72, while supply was only 58. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to set the base stock high enough to cover the immediate period's demand. Given the equal weight of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, but since demand is currently constrained by stockouts, historical means of 'sold' units are biased downward. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the latest regime shift and stabilization, which includes the recent spike to 72, to better estimate the required base stock and reduce the frequency of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand rebounded from a low of 48 to an average of 61.5 over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), with the most recent demand hitting 72. Sustained stockouts in P21-P23 indicate supply is currently insufficient for latent demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of sustained stockouts (Periods 20-24), indicating that true demand is significantly higher than historical mean and 'sold' units. In Period 24, the demand spiked to 93 units while only 62 were available. The demand trend is clearly increasing again after a period of decline (from ~48 to 93 in 5 periods). To break the stockout cycle and satisfy this rising latent demand, mu_hat needs to be set higher than the simple historical average of sold units. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the current upward shift from P20) to capture this recovery, but I will increase the buffer via sigma_hat to account for the gap between sold units and demand seen in the frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand has recovered from a low of ~50 units to 93 in Period 24. Sustained stockouts in 5 consecutive periods (P20-P24) confirm that latent demand significantly exceeds supplied quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile. We recently exited a 5-period stockout streak (P20-P24) where latent demand was clearly higher than supplied units. Period 25 saw a sudden drop to 27 units of demand, but given the preceding trend (72, 93), this is likely a high-variance dip rather than a sustained regime shift downwards. Lead time remains consistently at 0. With profit ($1) equal to holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median demand. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent rebound and subsequent dip, I will use a recent_N of 6 periods (P20-P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the low-demand trough and the high-demand spikes (avg sold/demand: 58, 59, 57, 72, 93, 27). Using N=6 provides a balanced view of the current localized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after 5 periods of stockouts where demand reached 93, Period 25 dropped sharply to 27. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be highly volatile with significant regime shifts. After a sustained period of low supply/stockouts (P21-P24) where demand peaked at 93, the last two periods have seen a sharp cooling, with demand values of 27 and 35. The carry-over insights suggest a possible rebound attempt in P24 that failed to sustain in P25-P26. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are identical, the OR target quantile is 0.5 (the median), meaning we want to minimize the risk of overstocking just as much as stockouts. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (P22-P26 average is approx 56.8), which prevents over-ordering based on the older high-demand peaks while respecting the recent volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to capture the current variance without being skewed by the massive spikes in the middle of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after a rebound to 93 in P24, demand dropped significantly to 27 and 35 in P25 and P26. The system is currently in a lower-demand, low-inventory state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of extreme demand volatility. Since Period 20, we have seen demand fluctuations between lows of 25-27 units (P19, P25) and spikes up to 93 units (P24). Most recently, Period 27 saw a demand of 63, which resulted in a stockout because the starting on-hand was only 57. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P20-P27) is approximately 58 units, but the high variance (standard deviation ~20) and frequent stockouts (P20-P24, P27) suggest that 'sold' units are undercounting true latent demand during spikes. In Period 28, we start with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently observed at 0. To capture the recent volatile regime while ensuring enough stock for the spikes (like P24 and P27), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to calculate mu_hat. This balances the recent lower-demand periods with the periodic spikes. Given high volatility and stockout risk, I'll rely on the backend's default sigma calculation (which includes the high-demand P24).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with no clear stabilization in the most recent periods (P25: 27, P26: 35, P27: 63, P28: 41). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 51.8. However, looking at the regime since P20, the demand fluctuates significantly between ~30 and ~90. Lead time is consistently 0. To manage this volatility and mitigate the risk of stockouts observed in P27, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower but erratic demand level. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 25 to account for the high variance (std of last 5 periods is approx 24.8), which ensures the base stock calculation provides a sufficient buffer for potential spikes back toward the 70-90 range without excessive overstocks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a highly volatile demand state. In Period 29, the demand was 67, resulting in a stockout (on-hand was 52). Lead time is consistently 0. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), demand has fluctuated significantly between a low of 27 and a high of 93, with an average of 57.2. However, the last 4 periods (P26-P29) show a mean of 51.5 (35, 63, 41, 67) but frequent stockouts (P27, P29) suggest latent demand is higher than what was 'sold'. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs (which equal profit), I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I'll choose N=10 to capture the current volatile regime that began around P20. This reflects a mean demand of approximately 60-70 units. Since on-hand is 0, the backend will order up to the base stock level calculated from these statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the P20 regime shift; recent periods (P26-P29) show oscillating demand (avg ~52 observed, but frequent stockouts suggest latent demand > 65). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is characterized by high demand volatility and frequent stockouts. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been 35, 63, 41, 67, and 61 (average 53.4), with stockouts occurring in 3 of those 5 periods. The frequent stockouts (P27, P29, P30) indicate that the 'sold' amount is under-representing true latent demand. Period 30 data shows we sold 58 units but demand was 61, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is reliably 0. Given the high volatility and current zero-stock position, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime's mean and variance, which account for the recent demand stabilization around ~55-65 units. However, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 70 to provide a small buffer against consistent under-ordering seen in historical stockout phases, while using calculate for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile with a high frequency of stockouts (60% stockout rate in P26-P30); true latent demand is likely 10-15% higher than sold quantities in this regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent stockouts, specifically occurring in 9 out of the last 12 periods (P20-P31). While observed 'sales' in the most recent periods (P27-P31) have hovered around an average of 53 units, actual demand in Period 31 was 57 and has recently peaked as high as 93 (P24). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level is 50%, but due to the high stockout frequency, the mean of 'sold' units is a biased downward estimator for latent demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current regime which averages around 55-65 units, but I'll set sigma_hat to 'explicit' at a higher value of 25 to account for the extreme volatility and frequent spikes that have led to the current stockout-prone state. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile, with a recent spike to 70 in Period 32 causing a stockout. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), observed demand has averaged approximately 54.4 units, but significant stockouts in P27, P29, P30, and P32 indicate that latent demand is higher, likely averaging closer to 65-70. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both at 0. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock level that covers the current period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this volatile 'rebound' regime while adjusting for latent demand by assuming a mean of 65. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~15). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but because we are chasing latent demand and costs are symmetric, I will slightly over-provide to avoid the current stockout streak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout regime (P27-P32): Demand frequently exceeds supplied quantities (4 out of last 6 periods). True latent demand in this regime is estimated to be ~65-70 units, roughly 20% higher than recent 'sold' units averages. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a volatile demand regime where 'sold' quantities often underrepresent true 'latent' demand due to frequent stockouts (observed in P27, P29, P30, and P32). Since Period 27, realized demand has fluctuated between 27 and 70+. Period 33 demand was 56, lower than the previous period's 70, but stockout patterns suggest we must hold enough to cover upward spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. The average 'sold' units over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is approximately 53.7, but because 4 of those periods were stockouts, the true mean is likely closer to 65. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 70 and sigma_hat to 15 to ensure high service level and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime.

The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to display significant demand volatility with a history of frequent stockouts. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 0 periods throughout the game, allowing for same-period arrival. In the most recent regime (P30-P34), demand has fluctuated between 45 and 70 units. Although 'sold' units averaged 54.8 over the last 5 periods, the presence of a stockout in P32 (demand 70 vs supply 58) indicates that latent demand remains higher than recent low-sales observations. To balance the risk of stockouts against the holding cost, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand cluster (average ~58.8), but I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 15.0 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed spikes (standard deviation of recent samples is ~10, but historical spikes suggest higher potential volatility). This approach ensures the base stock remains high enough to cover the upper end of the recent demand range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in P30-P34: average latent demand approximately 60 units (observed range 45-70). Stockouts in 1 out of the last 5 periods suggest supply needs to target at least 70 units to capture peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the period 30 shift. In the last five periods (P31-P35), observed demand has been 57, 70, 56, 45, and 52, averaging 56.0 units. Although stockouts occurred in P32, the recent trend reflects relatively stable mid-range demand. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the target cycle service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate based on mu_hat. However, to account for the high volatility (sigma) and prevent lost sales during spikes (like P32's demand of 70), I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P30-P35) to capture the current volatility and mean while ensuring the system targets a base stock that covers the observed peak of 70. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand spiked to 108, the highest seen since Period 14, causing a complete stockout. This indicates that the previous stabilized regime (avg ~60) has been disrupted by a significant upside outlier or a new shift. Over the last 5 periods (P32-P36), demand observations are [70, 56, 45, 52, 108], averaging 66.2. However, with the stockout in P36, the true latent demand is at least 108. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5. To capture the recent spike and prevent chronic stockouts seen in previous regimes, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean and volatility. Setting N=5 effectively weights the recent 108 spike into the average, raising the base stock level to proactively handle higher demand scenarios.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 36: realized demand was 108, breaking the ~60 unit stabilization seen in P30-P35. Stockout in P36 confirms supply was insufficient for current latent demand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked to 149 units, the second-highest in history, following a spike to 108 in Period 36. This confirms a significant upward demand regime shift or a major calendar event (e.g., a holiday or sporting event) not seen since the P6-P8 peak. With On-hand inventory currently at 0 and frequent stockouts (P36, P37), the previous estimate of ~60 units is no longer relevant. Average demand across the last 3 periods is 103 (P35-P37), but the most recent 2-period average is 128.5. Given the high stockout rate, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 to 130 to capture this new latent demand level. Sigma is kept high (30) to account for the extreme volatility (27 to 149 range). L remains 0 based on consistent delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 36: Sustained upward trend confirmed with spikes of 108 and 149. Average latent demand has shifted from ~60 (P30-P35) to >120 (P36-P37).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has entered a significant high-demand regime starting at Period 36. Observed demand in the last three periods (P36-P38) has been 108, 149, and 130 respectively. Despite increasing the order to 130 in Period 38, the entire stock was sold, resulting in an ending inventory of 0 and a potential stockout (as demand exactly equaled supply). This confirms the shift noted in CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS from a ~60 unit average to an average >120. Lead time remains consistently 0. To capture high-end demand peaks and avoid further stockouts in this new regime, I am setting mu_hat to 130 (the average of the last three periods) and using an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for the high volatility observed (108 to 149). This ensures the base stock calculation targets a high enough service level to meet latent demand.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 36: mean demand has shifted from ~60 to ~130 units based on P36-P38 data (108, 149, 130). Sustained stockouts or near-stockouts when supply is below 130 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a confirmed high-demand regime that started around Period 36. Lead time is consistently 0. Demand in the last four periods (P36-P39) has been 108, 149, 130, and 172. The current average of this regime is 139.75 units per period. In Period 39, we sold all 129 units available but demand was 172, indicating a substantial missed opportunity and confirming that latent demand is significantly higher than we are currently supplying. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts in this high-growth or high-seasonality phase, I will set mu_hat to 145 (slightly above the regime average but conservative relative to the 172 spike) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility (std dev of P36-P39 is roughly 27). The inventory is currently at 0, necessitating a full order to meet demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~140 units. Most recent demand at Period 39 reached 172 units. Persistent stockouts occur when supply is \u2264 130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward starting around Period 36. Recent observed demand (realized + stockouts) is 108, 149, 130, 172, and 186 in Period 40. The average realized demand over these last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~149, but this understates true latent demand because the system stocked out in 4 of those 5 periods. The most recent demand (186) confirms a peak that the current supply (145) failed to meet. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), a 50% service level is theoretically optimal for a single period, but frequent stockouts suggest the actual mean (mu_hat) needs to be adjusted higher to capture latent demand. I am setting L to 'default' (0) as the lead time remains stable. I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 185 to align with recent peak demand and ensure the capped base stock policy orders enough to meet this new level, and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 35 to account for the high volatility observed in this regime (range 108-186).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Latent demand has reached a new peak of ~185 units as of Period 40. Continued stockouts in 80% of periods since Period 36 indicate supply consistently lags behind latent demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand regime starting Period 36, with observations showing a sharp increase from ~60 units to an average of ~150 units in the most recent periods (P36-P41: 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137). Despite the slight relative dip to 137 units in Period 41, the overall regime remains significantly higher than history. Frequent stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods demonstrate that latent demand is consistently higher than provided supply. With a critical profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 0.5 (q=0.5 since Profit=$1 and Holding=$1), the base stock level should target the median of the distribution. Given the recent regime shift, N=6 is chosen for mu_hat to capture this high-demand period (P36-P41), while sigma_hat also uses N=6 to reflect the current extreme volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly upward starting at Period 36, entering a high-volume regime. Observed demand values from P36 to P42 are 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, and 125. This yields an average of 143.8 units per period over the last 7 periods, which is a clear departure from the previous ~60 unit average. Although the last two periods (P41-P42) show a slight cooling from the peak of 186, they remain significantly higher than historical norms. The on-hand inventory is currently low (22 units). To prevent stockouts while balancing the risk of high holding costs (since profit and holding cost are equal, targeting the median demand is usually optimal, but the OR backend logic z* uses the critical ratio q = 0.5 resulting in base_stock at the mean), I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods to capture this sustained high regime. Lead time is consistently 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~60 to ~144 units (evidence P36-P42: 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125). High volatility persists.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36. Over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), demand samples are 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, and 132. This gives an average demand of approximately 142.4 units per period. Prior to P36, demand was stabilized around 60 units. We have experienced stockouts when supply was below 130 in several recent periods. The current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the order placed now will arrive this period (P44). To cover a mean demand of ~143 plus a safety buffer for volatility (std dev of P36-P43 is ~26), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we order enough to meet the current high latent demand (averaging ~143) while accounting for the significant variance observed.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a confirmed high-demand regime that began at Period 36. Since then, demand has averaged approximately 143 units (P36-P44: 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132, 154). Period 44 resulted in a stockout (demand 154 vs supply 143), confirming latent demand continues to test or exceed current order levels. Lead time is stable at 0. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), which mathematically targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation; however, given the frequent stockouts and the high latent demand observed (reaching up to 186), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this entire high-regime mean (~143.7) and variance. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistics to cover the current high-demand state while accounting for high volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P36-P44) confirmed: Mean latent demand is approximately 144 units with peaks reaching 186. Stockouts in 6 of the last 9 periods indicate supply consistently underestimates the right tail of this regime.

The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 45, demand has averaged approximately 137.3 units (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132, 154, 80). Although Period 45 saw a drop to 80, the overall trend in this regime remains high and volatile, frequently leading to stockouts when inventory is insufficient to cover the 150-180 unit range. Lead time is reliably 0. I will use the recent_N method (N=10) to capture this current high-demand regime for both mean and standard deviation to ensure the base stock levels remain responsive to the high volatility seen since Period 36.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36. Since then, the mean demand has hovered around 140 units, though very recent observations (P45-P46) suggest a possible softening or high volatility with values of 80 and 97. However, given the high stockout frequency in the P36-P44 window (66% stockout rate), I must prioritize protecting against the high latent demand observed in earlier periods of this regime (peaks of 172, 186). The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 11 samples (P36-P46) to capture the current high-demand regime while recognizing the recent lower values. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a regime average of approx 142 units. Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we balance the recent softening with the demonstrated peak capacity of the current cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening observed in P45-P46 (avg 88.5) relative to P36-P44 (avg 144); monitoring for a potential downward shift from the high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a zero lead-time environment. Demand continues to exhibit significant volatility: after a brief softening in Period 45-46 (average 88.5), Period 47 surged back to 140 units, resulting in a stockout. This confirms that the high-demand regime starting at Period 36 (mean ~140) has not concluded and that the softening was temporary. Since Period 47 resulted in a stockout, latent demand was at least 140. I will prioritize the recent high-demand regime (P36-P47) where mean latent demand is approximately 144 units. I will set mu_hat to reflects this mean and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (Std \u2248 25-30) seen in this recent cluster to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening in P45-P46 was transitory; Period 47 demand of 140 reaffirms the high-demand regime (P36+) remains active with a mean of ~140 units and significant volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 49. Reviewing the demand history from Period 36 to Period 48, we are in a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 144 units (latest demand: 152, 140, 97, 80). There was a brief dip in P45-P46 (avg 88.5), but demand quickly rebounded to 140 and 152 in P47 and P48, confirming the high-demand regime is still active. Frequent stockouts (P47, P48) occur whenever supply is insufficient to cover the demand peaks, which frequently exceed 150 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the start of the regime shift at P36) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the high-volume, high-variance nature of the current period, aiming to minimize stockouts in this profit-dense phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a high-demand regime that began at Period 36. This regime is characterized by an average latent demand of approximately 140-145 units with significant volatility (highs of 186, lows near 80). There was a brief dip around Period 45-46, but recent periods (P47-P49) have returned to the 140-150 range. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts which have been frequent (e.g., P47-P49 sold < demand), I am setting mu_hat using the last 14 periods (P36-P49) to capture this specific high-demand regime. This provides a balance between the earlier peak (Period 40-41) and the more recent stabilization/softening cycles. Sigma_hat is also calculated using this N=14 window to ensure the backend accounts for the observed regime-specific volatility, maintaining a high service level for this profit-positive SKU.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P36-P49) reaffirmed: Average latent demand is ~142 units (P36-P49 range: 108 to 186). Supply consistently hits stockouts when ordering < 140 units.
