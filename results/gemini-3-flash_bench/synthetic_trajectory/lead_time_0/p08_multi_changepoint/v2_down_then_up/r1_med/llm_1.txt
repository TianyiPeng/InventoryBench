Based on the provided historical demand data for Period 1-5, the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 93.8 units (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). Given a high profit margin ($4.0) relative to holding costs ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to maintain a high service level. Demand shows a slight downward trend across the 5 sample periods, but I will target the historical average for the first order. Since the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), the order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. I will order 100 units to cover the expected demand of ~95 units with a small buffer for variance.",
