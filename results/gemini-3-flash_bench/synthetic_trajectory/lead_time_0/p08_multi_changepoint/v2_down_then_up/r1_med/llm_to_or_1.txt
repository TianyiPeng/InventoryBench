Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71. The average of these 5 samples is 93.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.5. Promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 0 (same-period arrival possible), we need to place an order immediately to cover Period 1 demand. I will use the mean of the available 5 samples as the forecast. Even though we are currently in Period 1, the system allows using the provided 'Historical Demand Data' which covers through Period 5 to set parameters. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this baseline mean. For sigmas, N=5 is the maximum available samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 108 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), but demand was 124, resulting in 16 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. No shipments are currently in transit. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the average demand is 93.8 with a standard deviation of 17.5. For Period 2, I will use all 5 samples to set the baseline forecast. Since the service level for this SKU is high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), and we already experienced a stockout in Period 1 due to high demand (124 units), I will use the 'default' calculation method which considers the full history to provide a stable base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we experienced a stockout because the OR engine's cap (based on mean demand) was too low to satisfy the demand spike of 124. In Period 2, demand dropped significantly to 71, leaving an on-hand inventory of 45. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Period 1 and 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0. For Period 3, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand volatility, rather than the initial 5 samples which might not reflect recent inventory dynamics. This will help the backend adjust the base stock to protect against the high variability seen (ranging from 71 to 124).

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 124 (sold 108 due to stockout), Period 2 was 71, and Period 3 was 57. The external 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) differs from the 'GAME HISTORY' observations (124, 71, 57). I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY as it reflects the actual environment state. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (arrived same-period). Demand appears to be trending downward (124 -> 71 -> 57). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent behavior while maintaining some buffer for volatility. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a relatively high service level is optimal. The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [95, 113, 106, 84, 71], with an average of 93.8 units per period. The concludes for P1-P4 show a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The system's target service level (q) is 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. Since on-hand inventory is low (11 units) and there is no in-transit inventory, we need to order for Period 6. Period 5 demand was 71, continuing a downward trend from the early peak. I will use the last 5 samples (all available) to estimate demand and volatility. Given L=0, the base stock formula simplified is mu + z*sigma. Choosing recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the backend to capture the current mean and standard deviation from the full history while staying responsive to the recent scale of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $406.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods is [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] (as provided in the summary) and the demand observed during game execution (Periods 1-5) is [124, 71, 57, 103, 103]. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals so far have confirmed an actual lead time of 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 6 units with 0 in transit. The mean demand of the last 5 operational periods is 91.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 26. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock formula should cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining responsiveness to the recent average.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed Periods 1-5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant spike in Period 6 (139 units), following two lower periods. Historical samples provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) plus the game history (124, 71, 57, 103, 103, 139) show high volatility. The last three periods (P4-P6) show significantly higher demand (avg 115) compared to P2-P3. In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 115 vs 139 demand), indicating the current safety stock or mu_hat calculation is too low for the current regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift (Average of 103, 103, 139 is 115), and a longer window (recent_N=6) for sigma to reflect the high volatility (124 down to 57 back up to 139). Actual lead time is confirmed 0 periods, allowing us to react instantly within the period. Setting L to calculate based on this history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4: Mean demand increased from ~65 to ~115 (Periods 4-6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical data shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods (all 7 periods confirmed L=0). A demand regime shift occurred around Period 4. Pre-shift (P2-P3) demand averaged ~64. Post-shift (P4-P7) demand values are 103, 103, 139, 111, resulting in a mean of 114. Demand volatility has also increased slightly since the shift. I am setting L to 0 (explicitly confirmed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current ~114 units/period requirement rather than the lower career average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through all historical periods (P1-P8). I will continue to use the default lead time. Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 4. Demand from Period 4 to Period 8 has been: 103, 103, 139, 111, 79. The mean of these last 5 periods is 107.0. The previous periods (P1-P3) had much lower or different demand patterns (124, 71, 57). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out the most recent drop to 79. Sigma_hat will also rely on these 5 periods to account for the increased volatility seen in the current regime. This ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy the recent average demand of ~107 units per period while being responsive to shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift starting from Period 4. The demand values from Period 4 to Period 9 are: 103, 103, 139, 111, 79, and 108. The mean of these last 6 points is approx 107.17, which is significantly higher than the initial periods (~84). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed across all 9 prior periods. The ending inventory is currently 18 units, which is low given the recent demand levels. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting L to the promised lead time (0) and using a recent_N window of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime and its associated volatility. This will allow the base stock to cover the current period's expected high demand plus a safety buffer based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 4: Mean demand established at ~107 units across Periods 4-9 (+27% from early periods). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern shows significant volatility following a regime shift that occurred at Period 4. Looking at the history, demands from Period 4 to Period 10 are: 103, 103, 139, 111, 79, 108, 64. The average demand in this recent regime is approximately 101. The latest observation (Period 10) was 64, which is lower than the recent average, but given the target service level (high profit compared to holding cost), we should maintain safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed arrive and are usable in the same period. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since Period 4, and calculate for lead time as the historical data is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the previous demand regime shift noted in Period 10 (~107 units) has softened over the last few periods. Looking at the demand from Period 4 onwards (103, 103, 139, 111, 79, 108, 64, 70), the average is approximately 97 units. However, the last two periods (64, 70) show a noticeable drop compared to the previous average. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 52 units and the lead time is 0 (same-day arrival), we need to ensure we cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent window (N=8, covering the regime starting from Period 4) to capture the higher mean compared to the very early start, while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to 0 explicitly as confirmed by history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with Period 12 seeing a spike to 128 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Looking at history from Period 4 onwards (the identified demand regime shift), demand has fluctuated between roughly 64 and 139 units. The mean for the last 9 periods (P4-P12) is approximately 100.5, while the mean for the very recent 3 periods (P10-P12) is 87.3. Given the stockout in P12, I will prioritize capturing recent variance while stabilizing the mean. I'll use a recent_N of 9 (P4-P12) for mu_hat to cover the full current regime and capture the higher demand spikes (100+ units) seen in P4, P5, P6, P7, P9, and P12. sigma_hat will also use N=9 to ensure the service level accounts for the high variance (std is ~27). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 4 through 12 characterized by high variance (range 64-139, mean ~100) and periodic stockouts when on-hand inventory is insufficient to cover spikes >120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand was 137 units, resulting in a stockout as only 122 units were available. This continues a pattern of high demand spikes (Period 6: 139, Period 12: 128, Period 13: 137). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the system operates as a chase strategy where the order arrives within the same period. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P4-P13) is approximately 104 units, but the high variance necessitates a higher base stock to prevent frequent stockouts. I will use the last 10 periods (since the demand regime shift in P4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=10 allows the OR backend to capture this higher mean and volatility compared to the full history which includes lower demand periods (P1-P3).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with three peaks >125 units in the last 8 periods (Periods 6, 12, 13), leading to repetitive stockouts when starting inventory is capped near 120.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all preceding 14 periods. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 4. Recently, demand has been highly volatile, with peaks exceeding 130 units (Periods 6, 12, 13) followed by moderate values (Period 14 at 106). Since we have had several stockouts (sold < demand at Periods 6, 12, 13) when inventory was capped too low, it is crucial to increase the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (Periods 4-14) to capture this higher mean (~104) and the associated high volatility. This allows the OR backend to calculate a pipeline requirement that accounts for the frequent spikes, aiming to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-variance regime since Period 4, with several spikes exceeding 125 units (P6, P12, P13). However, the most recent four periods (P12-P15) show demand of 128, 137, 106, and 90, which averages to 115.25. The current on-hand inventory is 36. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the high criticality of stockouts observed in the past (P6, P12, P13) and a high critical ratio (0.8), I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover these potential spikes. I will use the recent N=12 periods (P4-P15) to capture the higher mean (~103) and variance of this current regime while excluding the very early outliers. This will ensure the OR backend's inventory target accounts for the 100-140 demand range seen recently.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 16 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand since Period 4 has shown a higher average with significant volatility, ranging from 40 to 139 units. The most recent demand at Period 16 (40 units) is a notable low outlier compared to the average of the last 10 periods (~94 units). Given the high variance and the product's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, critical ratio q=0.8), the goal is to set a base stock level that prevents stockouts during spikes (which have exceeded 130 three times recently) while not overreacting to the single low data point in Period 16. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility, which reflects a mean of ~94 and a standard deviation around 31. This provides a safety cushion for upward spikes while acknowledging the recent lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand volatility remains elevated; Period 16 observed a significant drop to 40 units (lowest since start), but previous history (Periods 6, 12, 13) confirms potential for spikes >130. Mean demand over last 10 periods (N=10) is ~94.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18 analysis shows on-hand inventory at 47 units. The Lead Time is consistently 0 (confirmed by all 17 completed periods). Demand exhibits high volatility with peaks above 130 (Periods 1, 6, 12, 13) and recent lows (Periods 16 at 40, Period 17 at 72). The current demand regime starting from Period 4 has a mean of approximately 95 units, but standard deviation is significant (~28.5). To prevent the recurring stockouts observed in earlier periods when demand spikes, I am using a recent window (N=14, covering the regime since Period 4) to capture the higher variance. L is set to default as the promised 0 periods matches historical performance. mu_hat and sigma_hat use N=14 to prioritize the current regime's higher mean and volatility over the initial low-demand periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (order and arrival in the same period), as confirmed by recent history (Periods 1-18). Demand has been volatile but seems to Have softened slightly in the most recent periods (Periods 16-18: 40, 72, 73) compared to the mid-regime highs (peaks >130). However, history shows recurrent spikes following lulls. The current on-hand inventory is 48. To capture the recent mean while allowing for the established variance (sigma), I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=10 (covering Periods 9-18) captures the recent slower demand (mean ~84) but respects the high-standard deviation (approx 31) seen throughout this regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents stockouts during potential rebounds to 120+ units. L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high variance despite recent lower demand observations. The demand in the last three periods (P17: 72, P18: 73, P19: 68) is relatively stable but follows a period of significant volatility (P12-P13 peaks >125, P16 drop to 40). Historical data suggests that a return to higher demand levels (>120) is likely, and past stockouts occurred when base stock was set too close to the average. The critical safety stock level must account for these spikes to maximize profit (Profit $4 vs Holding $1). Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the recent lower demand trend with the need for safety stock against confirmed volatility, I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent stability while still weighting the high-variance regime of the mid-teens periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (N=10 from Period 11 to 20) with a mean of approximately 82 units and a standard deviation of 25.4. While earlier history showed spikes over 130, the most recent 5 periods (Periods 16-20) show a noticeable cooling with a mean of 63.8. Although there's a risk of mean reversion to high levels, I will use a window of N=10 to set mu_hat, which balances the recent demand drop with the legacy of higher volatility. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target cycle service level remains around 80%, but the OR backend's inventory cap (which limits orders to roughly mean + 2*std) will protect against excessive overstocking during this lower demand phase. I'm choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean while maintaining enough volatility coverage for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has softened significantly between Periods 16-20 (avg ~64) compared to the Period 4-15 regime (avg ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new, lower mean regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16-21), the mean demand is approximately 65.5 units, which is a significant drop from the previous high-variance regime (mean ~100). The last three periods (19, 20, 21) show stable demand at 68, 66, and 73 units respectively. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrival in the same period). Given current on-hand inventory is 38, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower mean while acknowledging the reduction in volatility. This will prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level reflective of the current demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand has dropped to ~66 units over Periods 16-21 (-34% vs previous regime), with significantly lower volatility compared to the P4-P15 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 22 with a spike to 108 units, deviating from the 'softening' observed between Periods 16-21 (avg ~64). This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand history now shows a return to higher volatility or a potential reversal of the soft regime. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the last 7 periods (P16-P22), which includes both the soft patch and the recent spike. N=7 is selected to capture this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility returned in Period 22: Demand spike to 108 units broke the P16-P21 soft regime (avg ~65), leading to a stockout.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility (P22: 108, P23: 30). The 'chunky' nature of demand makes the previous low-mean regime (Periods 16-21) unreliable as a forecast. Period 23 saw a significant drop to 30 units, the lowest volume recorded. However, the carry-over insights and historical peaks (139, 128, 137, 108) confirm that we face periodic spikes. With a lead time consistently at 0, we prioritize capturing these spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 59. I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the mix of the recent low regime and the sudden spike in Period 22, and using sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to reflect this renewed volatility. This local window balances the recent trend against the latent risk of another spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as a recurring feature: Period 23 demand dropped to 30 units immediately after a 108-unit spike in Period 22, indicating a very high-variance environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and regime shifts. After a sustained 'soft' period (Periods 16-21, avg ~66), Period 22 saw a spike to 108, followed by 30 in P23 and 73 in P24. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 67, but the volatility remains significant. Period 24 ended with only 14 units on hand. Given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, the target service level is 80%, meaning we must buffer against the potential for spikes >100 observed recently. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-mean but high-variance regime, effectively ensuring the backend base-stock calculation accounts for the recent history including the P22 spike and the low P23 observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified post-Period 21: Sequence of 108 (P22), 30 (P23), and 73 (P24) suggests a return to unpredictable high-variance behavior despite a lower overall mean (~67) compared to the mid-game regime (~100).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again after Period 21. While Periods 16-21 were stable and low (avg ~65), the last four periods (P22-P25) have shown extreme volatility (108, 30, 73, 53) with an average of 66. This high-variance behavior mimics the mid-game period (P4-P15) but at a lower mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With current on-hand inventory at 33 and a 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period average (N=10) to encompass both the soft period and the recent volatile spikes, while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (Standard Deviation of the last 4 periods is ~32, but given the 108 spike, a slightly higher buffer is safer). This approach balances the lower mean with protection against the recurring extreme spikes seen in P22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 22-26: 108, 30, 73, 53, 35) confirms a highly volatile environment where the mean has shifted lower compared to the mid-game, yet extreme spikes still occur. The mean of the last 11 periods (since the softness began at P16) is approximately 59, but the last 5 periods (since the volatility returned at P22) show a mean of ~60 with a high standard deviation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 69 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 0. Given the high variance and the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the overall lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility to influence the sigma calculation. This ensures a base stock high enough to buffer against those intermittent 70-100 unit spikes without over-stocking during the 30-40 unit troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility despite a lower average in the current regime. Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has fluctuated between 30 and 108 units (30, 73, 53, 35, 67, and the 108 spike in P22). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the history. Given the current low on-hand inventory of 15 units, there's a risk of stockout if another spike occurs. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~61 units (adjusted for Review+L), but I will set sigma_hat to explicit=30 to account for the high volatility demonstrated by the 108-unit spike recently. This approach ensures the safety stock is high enough to cover standard deviation spikes without over-ordering excessively for a potential low-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained lower mean compared to the mid-game regime. Over the last 7 periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged approximately 60 units (excluding the P22 spike), but with significant volatility (high of 108, low of 30). The current on-hand inventory is 36. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts from sudden spikes (like P22) against the holding cost in a lower-mean environment, I am setting the mean demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent history (N=7, covering the current soft regime) and maintaining a high volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to protect against spikes. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Mean demand over Periods 22-28 is ~60 units, significantly lower than the P4-P15 regime (~100), yet remains characterized by high coefficient of variation.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of ~61 units over the last 8 periods (Periods 22-29), but it remains highly volatile (range 30-108). Period 29 demand (51 units) follows a cluster of similar values (51 in P28, 67 in P27). However, history shows that spikes above 100 units can occur unexpectedly (P22). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing for the observed volatility in sigma_hat calculation. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during spikes with the cost of holding inventory in a lower-demand environment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has entered a stabilized low-demand regime since Period 22, with a mean of approximately 59 units (Periods 22-30). Although Period 22 saw a spike to 108, subsequent demand has remained consistently below 75 units, with the last four periods showing values of 51, 51, 59, and 73 (at Period 24). The actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To optimize the order for Period 31, I will use a recent window (N=9, corresponding to the start of this low-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower mean demand against the risk of occasional volatility. The goal is to reach a base stock level that covers the expected demand in Period 31 while accounting for the lower mean observed recently.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume, moderate-variance regime following the shift observed after Period 21. Over the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the mean demand is approximately 57 units (ranging from 30 to 108). Period 31 demand was 43. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To optimize for the current regime while protecting against occasional spikes (like the 108 units in P22), I will use the recent_N method with N=10 for both mean and volatility. This captures the lower mean of the current regime while reflecting the variance observed over the last 10 updates.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a lower mean since approximately Period 22. Over the last 11 periods (P22-P32), the mean demand is 58 units, down from the previous mid-game average of ~100. However, the volatility remains notable, with demand ranging from 30 to 108. The current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'default' (0), and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this lower volume regime accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed variance in this specific regime, which includes the significant spike in Period 22. This approach balances the lower average demand with the risk of occasional spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further since Period 22: Mean demand over Periods 22-32 is 58 units (down from ~100 in P4-P15), though significant volatility (30-108 range) persists.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at a lower mean (~60 units) compared to the mid-game, although high-variance spikes (like the 108 units in P22) and troughs (27 units in P33) remain possible. Recent demand from Periods 22-33 shows a mean of approximately 58.5 units. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand, high-volatility regime (starting from Period 22). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high coefficient of variation observed in this specific regime while reflecting the reduced average volume to minimize holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 22 with a mean of approximately 58 units, though it exhibits significant variability. In Period 34, demand was 63 units, following a low of 27 units in Period 33. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is low (11 units). I will continue using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the regime from Period 22 to 34) to capture the current lower mean while accounting for the persistent volatility (range 27-108). This ensures the base stock calculation sufficiently covers potential spikes above the mean without incurring excessive holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio favors a high service level (~0.8).

The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume, yet moderate-variance regime since Period 22. Over the last 14 periods (P22-P35), the mean demand is approximately 58.4 units, which is significantly lower than the ~100 unit mean observed in the middle of the game. However, the demand still exhibits volatility, with a range of 27 to 108 units. The most recent demand (P35) was 42 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized lower demand while accounting for the persistent variance, I will use a recent_N method with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire current regime length. The inventory position (On-hand: 32) is below the expected period demand, requiring a replenishment order to meet the (L+1) demand coverage.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower-mean, high-variance regime that began around Period 22. In Period 36, demand spiked to 104 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This follows a pattern of occasional spikes (e.g., 108 in P22) amidst a generally lower average (~55-60). Over the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is 55.1 with a standard deviation of approximately 22.7. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is high (80%), making it critical to buffer against these volume spikes. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current lower-mean but accounting for the observed volatility to prevent repetitive stockouts. L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains a defining characteristic: Period 36 spike (104 units) confirms that while the mean has settled near 55-60 units since Period 22, the system must still buffer for occasional demand >100 to avoid stockouts.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at a lower mean (~60 units) compared to the mid-game, but remains characterized by high volatility, as evidenced by recent spikes of 104 units (Period 36) and 82 units (Period 37). These spikes caused stockouts because the inventory levels were calibrated too tightly to the mean. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With a lead time of 0 periods, the decision at Period 38 must provide enough stock to cover the immediate demand of Period 38, including a buffer for the high variance (spikes >100). I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=16, covering the regime start at P22) to capture the current mean, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 25 to ensure the base stock calculation (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) targets a higher service level around 110-120 units to prevent further stockouts during spikes. The OR engine's critical ratio q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, giving z \u2248 0.84.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of extreme volatility within a lower-mean regime. While the mean demand since Period 22 has hovered around 60 units, recent periods (P36-P38) have shown a significant upward surge in demand (104, 82, 151), leading to three consecutive stockouts. Period 38's demand of 151 is a new all-time high, indicating either a temporary spike or a new regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the immediate stockout risk and recurrent spikes, I will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical fractile (q) is 0.8, meaning the base stock should cover the 80th percentile of demand. Based on recent volatility and the 151-unit peak, I will set mu_hat (which covers 1+L = 1 period) to 120 and keep sigma_hat high at 40 to ensure the backend OR engine maintains a base stock near 150-160 units, protecting against further spikes while acknowledging the lower average trend.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak of 151 units observed in Period 38, breaking the established volatility range (previous max ~108) and resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, a massive demand spike of 151 units occurred, far exceeding the previous volatility ceiling of ~108. This suggests either a new high-volatility demand regime or a significant event. While Period 39 demand returned to 92 (still high relative to the P22-P37 mean of ~58), the risk of another spike is significant. My goal is to protect against these higher peaks (92-151) while acknowledging the lead time remains 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the low-demand period into this recent high-volatility phase (starting roughly P22 to P39). For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' to set a high volatility buffer of 50.0 to account for the increased variance seen in the last three periods (104, 151, 92), ensuring the base stock level can cover potential spikes >140 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Extreme demand volatility regime confirmed. Recent peak of 151 (P38) and sustained high levels >90 (P37, P39) require significantly higher inventory buffers than the P22-P36 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has entered an extreme demand volatility regime starting around Period 37. Recent demands are 104 (P36), 82 (P37), 151 (P38), 92 (P39), and 123 (P40), which are significantly higher than the preceding P22-P35 mean of ~55. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed repeatedly in history and carry-over insights), the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for these new high-demand spikes. The average demand of the last 5 periods is 110.4, with a peak of 151. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (average ~110.4 per period) and N=20 for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility profile (which includes the extreme 151 spike and the lower periods), giving the OR engine enough buffer to handle demand up to ~140-150 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand regime has shifted significantly upward since Period 37, with mean ~110 over the last 5 periods and extreme peaks reaching 151. High volatility persists alongside this higher mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted dramatically upward and exhibits extreme volatility. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has reached levels of 82, 151, 92, 123, and 180 (mean ~126), far exceeding the previous stable mean of ~60. This new regime requires a significant increase in the base stock. The critical demand spike of 180 in P41 resulted in a stockout despite an arrival of 138 units. To prevent consecutive stockouts in this high-growth, high-variance environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, justifying a high service level (~80% target via backend z-score). Using N=5 captures the current upward trend while accounting for the recent extreme peak of 180. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified at Period 41: demand reached a new maximum of 180 units. Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 125.6 units, compared to ~60 units in the P22-P36 period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly upward starting from Period 37, with a recent sequence of 82, 151, 92, 123, 180, and 89 (last 6 periods). The mean of the last 6 periods is 119.5, and the last 3 periods averaging 130.6. There is extreme volatility with peaks reaching 180. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts observed in recent periods (P38, P40, P41), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This will ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to buffer against potential spikes exceeding 150 units while managing the higher holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 37: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~120 (+100%), with extreme volatility peaks now reaching 180 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began around Period 37 has intensified significantly. We are now in a high-mean, high-volatility phase where demand has twice exceeded 160 units in the last 6 periods (180 in P41 and 162 in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P37-P43) is approximately 125.8 with a very high standard deviation. To prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P40, P41, and P43, I am using a recent_N approach (N=7) to capture this new regime. This will raise mu_hat and sigma_hat to levels that better buffer against these new explosive peaks (up to 180 units) while acknowledging the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, which justifies a higher service level (80% critical ratio). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand regime shift confirmed P37-P43: Mean demand has risen to ~126 (+110% vs P22-P36) with new frequent peaks between 150-180 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 37. Over the last 8 periods (P37-P44), demand has averaged approximately 119.75 units, with extreme peaks reaching 151, 180, and 162 units. This high-variance, high-mean environment has led to frequent stockouts (Periods 37, 38, 40, 41, 43) because the inventory levels were insufficient to cover the upside volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this new, more aggressive demand regime and buffer against the frequent spikes >150, I am using a recent window of N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the higher mean (~120) and the increased standard deviation observed since the shift, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to satisfy the frequent peaks while accepting the higher holding cost associated with this risk profile (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has shifted significantly upward. Mean demand over the last 9 periods (P37-P45) is approximately 119.3 units, with extreme peaks reaching up to 180 units (P41) and 162 units (P43). Current period 45 saw demand of 113. Given the high criticality (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must ensure a high service level to capture these surges. I am setting L to 0 (consistent with historical performance). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9) to reflect the high-demand regime since Period 37. sigma_hat is set to explicit (45) to account for the extreme volatility observed (range of 75-180 in this regime), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover peaks around 180 while considering on-hand inventory of 41.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 37, characterized by a much higher mean and extreme volatility (peaks up to 180). Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is approximately 119.2 units, with a high standard deviation due to the wide range (75 to 180). Recent demand in Period 45 (113) and Period 46 (125) aligns with this elevated regime. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture this high-volume, high-variance regime while avoiding stockouts during the final periods, I will use recent_N with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased average and the significant volatility observed since Period 37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $435.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has significantly shifted upwards, with mean demand stabilizing around 120-125 units but characterized by extreme volatility (peaks up to 180 units). Recent demand (P45-P47) has been 113, 125, and 117, confirming a high-mean, high-variance state. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts in this high-volatility environment, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the shift from P37 to present) to capture the current mean of approximately 121 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=11 to capture the recent extreme standard deviation caused by peaks of 151, 180, and 162. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that sufficiently buffers against the 150-180 range seen in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P37 remains the dominant pattern: mean ~121 with high variance and recurring extreme peaks (150-180 range).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly starting around Period 37, characterized by a mean of approximately 121 units and extreme peaks reaching 180 units (P41). Over the most recent 5 periods (P44-P48), demand has been 75, 113, 125, 117, and 120, showing slightly reduced but still significant volatility compared to the P38-P43 window. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while buffering against the demonstrated high variance (standard deviation remains high), I am using a recent window (N=12) that captures this entire high-demand regime to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock remains high enough to cover potential spikes above 150 units while acknowledging the current mean level near 120. With L=0, the order will arrive in the same period, allowing for a tight reaction to the current stock level.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 37. Over the last 13 periods (P37-P49), the mean demand is approximately 119 units, with a standard deviation of about 32 units and extreme peaks reaching 151-180 units. The most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) show a very stable mean of 119 units (113, 125, 117, 120, 120), suggesting the trend is currently plateauing at this high level. Inventory levels must remain high to buffer against the demonstrated volatility, although lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this entire high-regime demand profile for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current mean and the risk of recurring spikes.
