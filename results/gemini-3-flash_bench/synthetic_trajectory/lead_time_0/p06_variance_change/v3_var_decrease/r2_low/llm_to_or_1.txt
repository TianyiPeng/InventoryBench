Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Initial demand data reflects significant volatility (58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we aim for the median of historical demand to avoid excessive holding costs. The promised lead time is 0. Given the small number of samples and the high variance relative to the mean, I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to incorporate all available historical context for this initial order while we establish a more stable demand profile. The inventory is currently zero, so an order will be triggered immediately.

Daily Profit: $55.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 55 units which arrived same-day (L=0). However, demand was significantly higher (145 units), resulting in 90 lost sales and zero ending inventory. The historical demand data shows high variance (58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Period 1's actual demand was 145, which is consistent with the high end of the historical range. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level q is 0.5. Given the high volatility and the stockout in P1, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent high-demand signal while acknowledging the zero-demand periods in the history. I will stick with the default lead time (0) as it was confirmed in P1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory has stocked out in both periods (on-hand 0 at conclusion), with demand (145, 134) significantly exceeding orders (55, 73). The historical demand samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) show extreme volatility and do not align well with the demand observed in the 'conclude' messages (145, 134). I will prioritize the more recent 'conclude' demand data. Average demand over the first two periods is approximately 140. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a 50% service level target in a standard newsboy, though the OR engine uses a capped policy), I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this higher recent volume. Since the variance is high, I will use a conservative sigma estimate.

Daily Profit: $87.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the system experienced significant lost sales (stockouts) because the demand (P1: 145, P2: 134, P3: 87) consistently exceeded the base stock levels generated by the OR engine's default settings. Note: In the user prompt's GAME HISTORY, the physical demand seen during the conclude phase differs from the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt (58, 163, 41...). Based on the execution logic, I prioritize the actual demand outcomes recorded in the 'conclude' messages: 145, 134, and 87. The current on-hand inventory is 53 units. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost, implying a 50% target service level), I need to set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the current period. I will use the mean of the observed demands (145, 134, 87), which is approximately 122. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for 1 period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 122 to guide the OR engine away from the lower values in its provided history and toward recent reality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has zero on-hand inventory and no units in transit. Historical demand is volatile: Period 1: 145, Period 2: 134, Period 3: 87, Period 4: 223. The provided user message 'Historical Demand' incorrectly lists Periods 1-5 as 58, 163, 41, 0, 12, but the GAME HISTORY (the actual sequence of events) clearly shows the demand as 145, 134, 87, and 223. I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY demand values. Average demand across these 4 periods is 147.25. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (4 out of 4 orders). However, the system has consistently under-ordered or under-stocked, leading to lost sales in 3 out of 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). I will use the last 4 periods (all available data) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high demand and volatility, while keeping L at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows high volatility with a range between 58 and 163 (mean: 55). Note that 'sold' units in history often equalled the starting inventory plus current arrival, suggesting stockouts occurred in Periods 1, 2, and 4. The raw demand samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) appear inconsistent with the 'conclude' messages which report demand of (145, 134, 87, 223, 138) respectively. I will prioritize the evidence from the 'conclude' logs which reflect real customer pressure. The average demand over the 5 historical periods is approximately 145.4 units. The Lead Time is consistently 0. Since both Profit and Holding Cost are $1.0, the target service level q is 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (median). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the average demand while accounting for high variance to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm that all orders from Periods 1-6 arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 87 to 223 (mean ~146). In the last 3 periods (P4-P6), demand was significantly higher (mean ~170) compared to the first 3 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. To better capture the recent upward trend in demand and prevent the frequent stockouts observed in P1, P2, P4, and P6, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the more recent high-demand regime while including enough samples to account for the high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-110.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 130 units following a significant demand drop in Period 7 (demand=20). Historical demand has been highly volatile, ranging from 20 to 223. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-7. Given the high volatility (std dev ~ 65) and the recent low demand point, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the current variability without overfitting to the single low outlier of Period 7. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the high potential for stockouts while acknowledging the inventory surplus currently on hand. Since the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand; thus, mu_hat must accurately reflect the average including the recent spike and dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This leads to a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median of the demand distribution. Looking at the history (Periods 1-8), demand has been highly volatile: 145, 134, 87, 223, 138, 151, 20, 116 (Mean \u2248 126.75, Std Dev \u2248 59.8). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. In Period 8, a decision was made to order 0 units because the inventory (130) was sufficient; however, we are now left with only 14 units on-hand. Given the high variance and the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 1, 2, 4, and 6, I will use all available historical data (N=8) to capture the full volatility. Setting L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-105.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 116 units with no units in transit. Historical demand shows extreme volatility (ranging from 11 to 223 units). Since Period 1, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the pipeline calculation. Over the last 9 periods, demand has averaged approximately 102.8 units with a high standard deviation. In the last three periods, demand has dropped significantly (Period 7: 20, Period 8: 116, Period 9: 11). Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim to stock close to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the overall volatility while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, suggesting a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This means we should aim to stock the median demand. Lead time history consistently shows 0 periods. Historical demand data from periods 1-10 shows significant volatility (range 11 to 223). However, calculating the mean demand over all available samples (including the seed data and the 10 game periods), the average is approximately 97. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for the current period (1+0=1). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the full game history mean (~110) while moderating the extreme volatility seen in the earliest samples. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the high standard deviation observed in the game periods, which is significantly higher than the training samples.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. This implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), leading the OR backend to target a base stock roughly at the median of the demand distribution (the 50th percentile). Observation of the history shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. Demand has been highly volatile, ranging from 11 to 223 across the first 11 periods, with an additional five historical samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Calculating the mean of all available 16 samples yields ~79, while the mean of the 11 periods of play is ~111. The most recent 5 periods (P7-P11) show a lower mean of ~48.8, suggesting a recent downward shift in demand compared to the earlier high-demand periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime while maintaining enough variance to protect against the high volatility observed in this SKU.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), implying a service level target of 50%. However, we have experienced several stockouts (P1, P2, P4, P6, P12) because demand is highly volatile, ranging from 11 to 223. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand data (initial samples + periods 1-12) shows a mean of roughly 90 units per period, but recent demand has fluctuated significantly. Period 12 saw a spike (168) which cleared out all inventory. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to order to cover upcoming demand. I will use the last 12 periods (the full game history) to calculate demand metrics as they represent the most relevant distribution compared to the initial 5 samples. Setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high variance while maintaining a stable average.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (Profit $1.0 vs Holding Cost $1.0, critical ratio q=0.5), targeting a base stock near the median. Analyzing historical demand (P1-P13: 145, 134, 87, 223, 138, 151, 20, 116, 11, 74, 23, 168, 109), the mean is approx 107.6 and std approx 65. Demand is volatile with spikes over 200 and lows near 10. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded orders. The system currently has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory after selling out in P13. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (all available post-warmup samples) to capture the current volatility while basing the forecast on the observed distribution. This ensures the OR backend targets a stock level sufficient for a 0-lead-time environment where current period demand is satisfied immediately upon arrival.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility. Analyzing the full history (Periods 1-14) plus the preliminary data provided (Period_1 through Period_5 in the initial prompt), we see a wide range of demand values (from 0 to 223). The recent demand history (last 5 periods: 74, 23, 168, 109, 43) averages approximately 83.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the target service level (q) is 0.5. In a base-stock model where q=0.5, the base stock level targets the median demand over the review+lead time (1+L = 1 period). Given the high variance and the specific penalty structure (where holding cost equals profit), the OR backend will aim to carry less inventory to avoid high holding costs while still meeting the median demand. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility while relying on the calculated lead time which reflects the promised L=0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or trend-based regime shift based on the provided history. The average demand across all historical data (including seed samples) is approximately 84.7 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaged 79.2 units per period. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00 each), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 units with 0 in-transit. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture current volatility while Smoothing out very recent lows. This serves to buffer against the high variance (std dev ~65) seen across the full series.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or structural trend. Recent demand values fluctuate significantly: Period 13 (109), 14 (43), 15 (53), 16 (109). The historical average demand across all periods (1-16) is approx 95, but the last 4 periods average around 78.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent local demand average and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. L is set to default (0).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 11 up to 223. Over the last 17 periods, the average demand is 88.75. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17), demand was 109, 43, 53, 109, and 95, averaging 81.8. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), which simplifies the base stock to exactly mu_hat. There is zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit inventory, and the actual lead time is consistently 0 (same-day delivery). I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. I'll use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand variability while smoothing out the extreme fluctuations observed in very early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility but generally behaves like a high-turnover snack product. Mean demand over 18 periods is approximately 95 units, but there are multiple stockouts (Periods 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18) indicating the current order logic is slightly under-catering to demand spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To prevent frequent stockouts observed in the last 3 periods (sold < demand), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the more recent demand trend which averages around 96 units, while maintaining a default L=0 to ensure same-period arrival. This should provide a more responsive base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility throughout the history, with a recent period (P16-P19) showing consistently higher demand (averaging ~110 units) compared to the overall historical mean. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals to date have confirmed this (lead_time was 0 periods). Despite high demand, ending on-hand inventory is frequently zero, indicating stockouts and lost revenue. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To capture the recent demand surge and mitigate stockouts while respecting the OR backend's capped policy, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P15-P19) to reflect the current regime. This results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+0) * ~98.8 units. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 16 onwards: average demand increased to approximately 110 units per period compared to earlier lower-demand spurts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16\u201320) shows a higher sustained average of 112 units (109, 95, 123, 114, 119) compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 0. Since the profit is $1.0 and the holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock should aim for the expected demand (mu_hat). However, given the high volatility and the fact that we have been stocking out for the last 5 periods (ending inventory consistently 0), I will set mu_hat more aggressively using the recent average and increase sigma_hat to provide a buffer against demand spikes. L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 16 onwards) shows a consistently higher average compared to the early history. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is 110.17 units per period (109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101). The on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units) and there's no stock in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals confirm same-period delivery (W=0), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while ignoring the earlier volatile and lower-demand period. This should provide enough stock for the current period's demand while minimizing stockouts.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a stable average around 108.57 units per period (109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101, 109). The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), and there are no units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic using the critical ratio q = 0.5 will set the base stock at the median demand. To ensure we cover the most recent demand level and maintain a buffer against stockouts\u2014which have occurred frequently in the past few periods\u2014I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized regime (Period 16 to 22). This allows the engine to adapt to the higher volume compared to the early history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 109 units (Avg: 108.6 over last 7 periods, P16-P22) with consistent 0-day lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 16, showing much higher consistency compared to the volatile early periods. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged approximately 110.75 units (109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101, 109, 116). Lead time is reliably 0 periods as confirmed by consecutive 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward the median demand. I will use the recent 8-period window (N=8) to capture this stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the service level matches this specific demand pattern without over-ordering based on historical volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 107 units per period (P16-P24). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 24 conclude' message. The ending inventory for Period 24 is 39 units. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 9 (Period 16 to 24) to capture this specific demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses the most relevant mean and variance for the single review period (L=0, so 1+L=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 16 onwards) for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 107 units per period. The last 10 periods show an average demand of 106.3 units (Sample: 109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101, 109, 116, 72, 109). Historical data suggests a pattern of stocking out frequently due to demand exceeding supply (ending on-hand is often 0). Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit and reduce stockouts, I will use a N=10 window for mean and variance to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the volatile historical data from Periods 1-15. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) for the base stock calculation is 0.5 (1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0)). This means the OR policy will aim to cover the mean demand when Lead Time is 0. Standard deviation is relatively low compared to the mean in this stable regime, so recent_N=10 for sigma_hat is appropriate to provide a representative safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 16 to 25: average demand 106.3 units, standard deviation 13.9. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, following a shift in the early-game dynamics. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of roughly 13.9 units. In the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand recorded was [109, 116, 72, 109, 80], averaging 97.2 units, though the longer-term regime since P16 is closer to 104. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the Critical Service Level formula q = profit / (profit + holding_cost), where profit=$1.0 and holding=$1.0, the target service level is 0.5 (z=0). This suggests a base stock level (mu_hat) near the median/mean of the demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (tracking back to the Period 16 changepoint) to capture the current regime accurately while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a 50% service level plus its internal cap.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 101.4 units and a standard deviation of 15.6 over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 27, the demand was 91, and we started Period 28 with 14 units on hand. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q = 0.5, which leads the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0) when using a base-stock policy. I am using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while excluding earlier volatile periods. This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period without over-ordering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 104 units and a lead time of 0. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), demand has averaged 104.1. While there was a slight dip previously, the most recent period (P28) saw demand at 107. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) needs to cover ONLY the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period). Applying N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the current regime's characteristics (Mean ~100, Std Dev ~15) while filtering out the high volatility from the very early game. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock level immediately.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 101.8 units over the last 14 periods (P16-P29). Recent performance (P26-P29) shows a slightly lower average of 88.25 units, but with significant variation (75 to 107). Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by every order since P1 arriving within the same period. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock equal to the mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat to capture the current regime and recent_N (N=14) for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 into a regime with a mean of approximately 101.4 units (P16-P30 average). Recent demand (P26-P30) specifically averages 90.2 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history, allowing for same-period arrival and fulfillment. On-hand inventory is currently low (4 units). I will use a window of 15 periods (from Period 16 onwards) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=15 for mu_hat yields a target base stock that reflects the current mean of ~101, and N=15 for sigma_hat captures the moderate volatility seen in this window. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate given the high consistency of 0-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability (P16-P30): average demand 101.4 units/period, consistent 0-day lead time confirmed over 30 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 31 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 101.3 units with a standard deviation of 14.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The service level target (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.5 (1/(1+1)), implying the base stock should ideally target the median of the demand distribution to balance stockout and holding costs equally. I will use a recent window of 16 periods (N=16) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly reliable at 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 16, with a visual mean around 100 units and low volatility. The current observed mean from Period 16 to 32 is approximately 101.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning we should target the mean demand to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. I will use the recent 17 periods (P16-P32) to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend with L=0 will target a base stock covering the current period's demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units/period and a consistent actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the median of the demand distribution (approximately the mean for symmetric distributions). I will use a recent_N of 18 (covering the stable period from P16 to P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the observed lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, following a regime shift from an earlier volatile period. Over the last 19 periods (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 101 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 13 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period X conclude' messages. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns with the mean (mu_hat) in a normal distribution. I will set L to 0 (explicit), mu_hat to approximately the recent mean (102) using recent_N (N=19 to cover the stable regime), and sigma_hat to the recent volatility using recent_N. This targets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while inventory is low (on-hand is 9).

Specifically, from Period 31 to 35, the demand values were 97, 100, 110, 93, and 97, yielding a mean of 99.4. On-hand inventory is low (4 units) following Period 35. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime starting from Period 16, which provides a robust mean (approximately 100) and standard deviation for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand (approximately 100 units per period).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. The last 21 periods (P16-P36) show a mean demand of 101.4 and a standard deviation around 13.0. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Using the recent_N method with N=21 (the length of the current stable regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide an accurate base stock level to cover current demand while minimizing holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal (service level target is 50%). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a specific regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 37, the average is 99.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 12.6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring that orders placed during the decision phase arrive and are available to meet the current period's demand. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, though the OR engine's capped policy provides additional safety. To maintain this stability and reflect the most recent data, I will use a window of the last 22 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as history confirms the 0-period lead time is reliable.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 98-100 units over the last 10 periods (P29-P38). The inventory levels at the end of each period are consistently low (0-12 units), indicating the capped base-stock policy is effectively managing the trade-off between stockouts and holding costs given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent stable phase of the current regime while maintaining responsiveness to minor fluctuations. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a specific regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 39 (the last 24 periods), the average demand is approximately 99.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 12.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire game. Since Period 31, the mean demand has hovered around 96-100 units. I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable sustained demand regime and provides a robust sample for the OR backend. With profit and holding costs being equal ($1.0), the service level targeted by the backend (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning it aims for the median. Providing These parameters will allow the backend to maintain a base stock that covers the likely demand while minimizing the holding cost, which is crucial given the high relative holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 31 to 40 (the last 10 periods), the mean demand is 97.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 9.3 units. This confirms the stability noted in previous carry-over insights. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median. For a normal distribution, the median equals the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent stability in mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets approximately 97-100 units total (on-hand + order) to cover the current period's demand without excessive carrying costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P31-P40 mean demand is 97.1 units (\u03c3 \u2248 9.3). Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a specific regime since approximately Period 16. Analyzing the most recent block of data (Period 31 to 41), the mean demand is 97.36 units per period with a standard deviation of 9.38. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (representing the stable period from P31 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand behavior effectively. Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0/unit, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will roughly equal the mean demand. The OR backend's capped policy will further manage risk. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been reliably 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 16, and even more consistent since Period 31. Over the last 12 periods (P31-P42), the mean demand is 95 units with a standard deviation of approximately 9 units. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period X conclude' messages. Current on-hand inventory is 10 units. I am setting L=0 (default) and using recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized performance. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock level that balances the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost, which mathematically targets a 50% service level, but given the 0-day lead time and stable demand, this approach minimizes stockouts while preventing overstocking.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently stable since Period 16, with a more recent slight downward trend in the mean observed since Period 31. Current analysis of the last 13 periods (P31-P43) shows a mean demand of approximately 94 units per period with a low standard deviation. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. Given the equal weight of Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target using mu_hat. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the recent slight reduction in volume. The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (3 units), so the OR engine needs accurate parameters to replenish stock for Period 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable but slightly lower: P31-P43 mean demand is 94.5 units (standard deviation 9.4). Actual lead time continues to be 0 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a slight downward adjustment observed around Period 31. From Period 31 to 44 (14 periods), the mean demand is approximately 94.6 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 8.7. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). The unit profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) result in a critical fractile of 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand (approximated by the mean for symmetric distributions). Given current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 0, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using a recent_N of 14 to capture the most stable recent regime (P31-P44) while providing smoothed parameters to the OR backend.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable since Period 16, though it has shown slight fluctuations. Over the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 95.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.9. In the very recent periods (P41-P45), demand has been 79, 86, 92, 99, 118, indicating a slight upward trend or return to the higher end of the current regime. Given the zero lead time (L=0) and the critical nature of satisfying demand in the same period, I will use a recent window of N=10 to capture the current volatility while maintaining responsiveness. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the 0-day lead time + 1 review period demand (Total 1 period). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock will naturally gravitate towards the median/mean. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the backend reacts to the current dispersion and average.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a narrow range. Over the most recent regime starting at Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 96 units with a standard deviation around 10. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. In Period 45 and 46, demand slightly spiked to 118 and 107 units respectively, leading to stockouts because the order quantities (based on previous mean estimates) were insufficient to cover the upside. To maximize reward and prevent stockouts in these final periods, I am maintaining L at 0 (consistent with history) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering P31 to P46) to capture the current stable-but-variable regime while accounting for the recent slight increase in volatility.

Analyzing the most recent data from Period 31 to 47 (17 periods), the mean demand is approximately 96.5 units, which is consistent with the previously identified stable range (~95-100 units). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history, allowing for same-period arrival and a responsive replenishment strategy. Current on-hand inventory is 6 units. To maintain the service level across (L+1) periods (which is 1 period here), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=17 to capture this stable regime, balancing the high service level required by the Profit vs. Holding cost ratio (1:1 implies a critical ratio of 0.50, but the OR engine's use of \u03c3 compensates for stockouts). Given the stability, 17 periods provide a robust sample for mean and volatility calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean around 95-100 units since Period 31. Recent demand (P45-P48) has shown higher volatility with values of 118, 107, 91, and 135 (avg \u2248 112.75). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the final periods (current P49, total 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet this slightly elevated demand while minimizing residual inventory at the end of Period 50. I will use a recent window (N=18, starting P31) to capture the current regime's mean and variance effectively, as it balances the stable long-term mean with the recent spikes. $L=0$ is certain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 45-48 shows an uptick in mean (approx 113) and volatility compared to the P31-P44 average (approx 95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown a sustained uptick over the last 5 periods (P45-P49), with an average demand of approximately 112 units (118, 107, 91, 135, 109) compared to the previous regime (P31-P44) which averaged around 94.5 units. The variance has also increased. To account for this shift and ensure adequate service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this the most recent 5-period regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding within the same period; therefore, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time from history. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the previous period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 45: Average demand increased from ~95 to ~112 units/period (+18%) with increased volatility.
