Looking at the provided historical demand for Period 1-5 (58, 163, 41, 0, 12), there is significant volatility with an average around 55 units. Given that the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), the order placed now will arrive during this period's resolution phase to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1 demand immediately, I will order based on the initial historical sample (58 units) plus a small buffer for the high variance seen in Period 2 (163). I will target 80 units to balance the risk of stockouts against the $1.0 holding cost, noting that the demand for Period 2 is significantly higher in the history.",

Since lead time is 0, I only need to cover the current period's demand (Period 2).
