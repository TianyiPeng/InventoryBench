My goal is to maximize profit (Profit: $4.0, Holding Cost: $1.0) by balancing stock availability against holding costs. Historical demand samples provided are: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12 (Mean: ~54.8). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for demand within this same period. However, given the high variance in historical data (ranging from 0 to 163) and the risk of lead time variability or order loss, I need to establish a baseline inventory immediately. Since on-hand is 0, I will order a quantity that covers the mean demand plus a safety margin to account for the high historical spikes (like 163). Forecasting based on the average of the five samples (~55), I will order 80 units to ensure I can satisfy moderate demand while keeping holding costs manageable if demand ends up being lower (like the 0 or 12 observed in samples).",

My goal is to maximize Period 50 profit while minimizing the ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Targeting a stock level of 110-115 units to cover the current mean plus a small safety margin for recent volatility (P47: 128, P48: 105, P49: 91). Ordering 66 units will bring total supply for this final period to 115 units, which is sufficient to cover the likely demand range while keeping potential holding costs low.",
