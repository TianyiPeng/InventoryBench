Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no prior inventory and a historical demand record for the first 5 samples (58, 163, 41, 0, 12). The promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive within this same period before demand resolution. Given the Profit of $19 and Holding Cost of $1, the critical ratio (q) is 0.95, justifying a high service level. The demand is highly volatile (Mean \u2248 55, SD \u2248 64). Since we are at the start and the demand history suggests some early peaks followed by a drop, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (all available samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant statistics while L remains at the default promised value of 0. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average and the significant variability observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 162 units which arrived immediately (lead time 0), resulting in 145 sales and 17 units remaining on-hand. The demand history (58, 163, 41, 0, 12, 145) shows significant volatility with a recent high of 145. I will use the last 3 periods to calculate the demand parameters (recent_N=3) to focus on the more recent activity while acknowledging the zero-demand periods earlier. The lead time is confirmed as 0, so I will use the default promised lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Historical demand shows Period 1: 145 and Period 2: 134 (mean ~140). The demand samples provided in the prompt (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) appear to describe a different SKU or environment context than the actual game history provided. I will prioritize the Conclude messages which show a stable demand regime around 140 units. Observed lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since on-hand (51) is significantly lower than average demand (~140), I need to set parameters that trigger an order to cover the current period's demand. I will use the last 2 samples (N=2) to reflect the recent high-demand regime observed in the conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1587.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all three concluded periods (P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown a downward trend from 145 to 87 units. Given the short history (3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which provides a more reactive forecast than the 'default' (all-sample) mean. Using N=3 (all available concluded data) reflects the current volatility and helps the OR backend establish a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period (L+1 = 1) while accounting for the high initial variance seen in the first two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3287.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked significantly to 223, exhausting on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. The historical demand data provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) appears to be irrelevant or a placeholder, as the actual concluded demand history (145, 134, 87, 223) shows much higher volume and high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 4 periods of actual observation for the demand mean and standard deviation to ensure the 'base_stock' calculation accounts for the recent demand surge and prevents further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this trend while smoothing the spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2519.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the 5 periods of history, the average demand is 145.4 units per period (145, 134, 87, 223, 138), though it shows high volatility (standard deviation ~48.7). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 4, we experienced a stockout because demand (223) significantly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory (173), highlighting the need for a safety stock buffer. Currently, we have 103 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent high-volatility demand environment while maintaining the base stock level required to cover current and lead-time demand. The OR backend's service level (q) will be high (19/(19+1) = 0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit compared to the holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2793.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but a stable trend over the first 6 periods. Historical demand samples: P1: 145, P2: 134, P3: 87, P4: 223, P5: 138, P6: 151. (Note: The user-provided prompt preamble 'Historical Demand Data' listed some values (58, 163, 41, 0, 12), but the actual Game History shows much higher demand values (145, 134, etc.) which I will prioritize). The average demand over the 6 active game periods is approximately 146.3. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period for all orders P1-P6. I will use the last 6 samples (all available game data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to establish a reliable baseline. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.95, justifying a higher service level. Setting L to calculate to confirm the observed 0-period lead time remains stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed in all 7 periods). Demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility, with a significant drop in Period 7 (20 units) compared to higher peaks in previous periods (e.g., 223 in P4, 151 in P6). The mean demand across all 7 periods is approximately 128 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show a mean of 103 units. Given the high variance (std ~66), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to the volatility observed in the historical data (P1-P5 samples). On-hand inventory is currently high (199 units) due to the low demand in P7, so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to reach the calculated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but no clear sustained trend. The initial sample data (pre-game: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12) differs significantly from the realized demand in the game (averaging approx. 126 units/period across Periods 1-8). Recent demand has fluctuated between 20 and 116 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to use the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm choosing 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus on the game-play demand levels (Periods 1-8) rather than the pre-game baseline samples, as the game demand is consistently higher and more representative of the current environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with spikes (e.g., Period 4: 223) followed by significant drops (e.g., Period 7: 20, Period 9: 11). The mean demand over the first 9 periods is approximately 113 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed cycles. Currently, we have 211 units on hand, which is high considering the recent low demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while still protecting against the high variability observed in earlier periods, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the recent downward trend while remaining sensitive to sudden shifts. The lead time remains at the default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1269.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility throughout the 10 periods, with values ranging from 11 to 223. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-10) is approximately 104.9. In the most recent four periods (7-10), demand has been specifically volatile (20, 116, 11, 74), averaging 55.25, while the initial periods (1-6) averaged 146.3. Given this shift, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to balance the high initial demand and the recent lull, but I am keeping sigma_hat on default to capture the full historical variance (std \u2248 67), which is necessary for a product with frequent stockouts (Period 4) and drastic drops. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy at 137 units, which is above the recent average demand, suggesting the OR backend will likely order a small replenishment to align with the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile over the first 11 periods, with values ranging from 11 to 223. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period as ordering (Periods 1-9, 11). Given the high variance and lack of a clear seasonal trend, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand environment, which has averaged approximately 48.8 units (periods 7-11: 20, 116, 11, 74, 23). This recent average is lower than the long-term average (~102), and using recent_N helps avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase while still carrying enough stock to handle spikes. The service level target (z*) computed by the backend will be high (~95%) because profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3162.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or trend pattern in the first 12 periods, with demand values ranging from 11 to 223. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (L=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (30 units) following a high demand period (168 units in Period 12). Since there are no missing shipments and the lead time remains stable at 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recent history of this volatile demand, as no distinct regime shift is yet evident. This approach allows the OR engine to set a base stock that accounts for the high variance (sigma) while targeting a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% critical fractile).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile over the last 13 periods, ranging from 11 to 223 units. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P9-P13), we see demands of 11, 74, 23, 168, and 109, giving a mean of 77. This is lower than the initial periods' higher volume but shows extreme swings. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level (q) is approximately 95%, which appropriately keeps safety stock for these spikes. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and more recent demand levels, while maintaining L at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $677.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with recent samples showing significant fluctuations (Period 12: 168, Period 13: 109, Period 14: 43). Based on all history including the seeds, there is no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift; rather, it appears to be a high-variance process. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-9, 11, 13, and 14. I will use 'calculate' for L to confirm the 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (all available game periods) to capture the current volatility while dampening the impact of the seed values (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) which differ from the recent game history. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the high mean demand and the significant standard deviation observed in the actual game play.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility, with a mixture of spikes and low-demand periods. Looking at the last 15 periods (excluding the initial P1-P5 seed data to focus on recent behavior), the average demand is approximately 104 units per period (1562 total / 15 periods). Recent demand (P14-P15) has been lower (43, 53), but P12 was high (168). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 154 units on-hand. Since L=0, the OR backend's target base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) should cover the current period's demand (N=1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while keeping most of the history, as no distinct demand regime shift is evident beyond general high variance. Setting L to 'default' (0) confirms the observed lead-time consistency.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown high volatility with no clear seasonal or trend shift, fluctuating between 11 and 223 units. Over the last 16 periods, the mean demand is approximately 106.5 units with a high standard deviation. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there are 61 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To ensure we cover potential demand spikes (like Period 4's 223 or Period 12's 168) while managing the holding cost ($1.0 vs $19.0 profit), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture more recent demand levels (avg ~82 since Period 7, though earlier periods were higher). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent variability while maintaining a high service level due to the high profit margin.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but no clear structural break in mean over the 17 concluded periods (mean \u2248 93). Promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (W=X-Z) has consistently been 0 periods for every order placed. Current inventory is 63 units with zero in-transit. Since there are no detected regime shifts in demand mean or lead time, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=17 (all valid policy periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance while anchoring to the stable historical mean. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high standard deviation (approx 60) relative to the mean demand.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or trend-based regime shift based on the provided history (Period 1-18). The mean demand over 18 periods is approximately 96 units, though the samples vary from 11 to 223. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order arriving in the same period it was placed. To manage the high volatility while acknowledging the 0-period lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the full breadth of observed variance. Using all 18 samples provides a more stable estimate than shorter windows given the high variance. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2085.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 11 to 223 over 19 periods. There are no clear seasonal markers given the 'Period_N' date format, but recent demand (Periods 12-19) has stabilized somewhat around a higher mean compared to the extremely low periods (7, 9, 11). Analyzing the last 8 periods (Period 12-19), the average demand is 101.75. Lead time is consistently 0 (arriving in the same period as ordered). I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture this moderate demand regime while filtering out the noise of the very early periods. The choice of N=8 balances the need for a stable average with the sensitivity to recent shifts in the demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of ~102 units over the last 8 periods (P12-P19), following high volatility in the first half of the horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2213.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a consistent mean following initial high volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P12-P20), the average demand is approximately 104.8 units (168, 109, 43, 53, 109, 95, 123, 114, 119), supporting the previous carry-over insight of a regime shift around Period 12. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 48. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the earlier erratic data. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that appropriately covers the current demand profile (approx. 105 units/period) while accounting for the standard deviation observed in this period, ensuring high service levels with minimal holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P12-P20 average demand is 104.8 units, replacing the P12-P19 estimate of 102.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1854.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of ~105 units over the recent regime (P12-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 65 units with zero in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 22, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized demand regime (P12-P21), which provides a representative sample of mean (~104) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers expected demand plus safety stock for the current period, while L=default utilizes the reliable 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable: P12-P21 average demand is 104.3 units (S.D. ~39), maintaining the post-P12 shift from previous high volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~104.5 units since Period 12. Recent demand values from Period 12 to Period 22 are: 168, 109, 43, 53, 109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101, 109. The average of these 11 samples is 104.54 with a standard deviation of 31.9. The current on-hand inventory is 53, and there is no inventory in transit. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the recent N=11 regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 0. This ensures the base stock reflects the current stable demand environment while accounting for observed volatility to maintain a high service level (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2160.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that started around Period 12. Calculating the mean demand from Period 12 to Period 23 (12 samples) gives 104.9 units (168, 109, 43, 53, 109, 95, 123, 114, 119, 101, 109, 116). The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the service level target (critical ratio) is high (0.95), justifying a robust base stock to cover demand volatility. Since the demand has been highly consistent over the last 12 periods, setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the most relevant recent statistics for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P23 average demand is 104.9 units (N=12), consistent with previous insights.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified from Period 12 onwards. The average demand from Period 12 to Period 24 (N=13) is approximately 102.3 units. The most recent demand (Period 24) was 72 units, which is slightly lower than the average but within the expected volatility (S.D. of the regime is ~36). Physical lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as orders arrive in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 86 units on hand and 0 in-transit. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=13 (covering the stable Period 12-24 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness to the current demand pattern without being overly influenced by the highly volatile early periods (P1-P11). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent regime since Period 12. Using the data from P12 to P25 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 103.6 units with a standard deviation of 33.6. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P22-P25) have seen demand values of 109, 116, 72, and 109, reinforcing the stability around the 100-unit mark. There are no pending shipments, and the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 47 units and the stable demand, setting the OR parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on this recent regime (N=14) ensures the backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the upcoming period's demand while maintaining a high service level (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1), without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P25 average demand is 103.6 units (N=14), consistent with previous observations of ~104 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized since Period 12. Analysis of the demand from Period 12 to Period 26 (N=15) shows a mean of 103.2 units per period. This confirms the previous insight that the demand regime has shifted and stabilized around ~104 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Using N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will accurately capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility while excluding the higher variance observed in the first 11 periods. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that appropriately balances the 95% service level requirement (calculated from the high profit margin of $19 vs $1 holding cost) with current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P26 average demand is 103.2 units (N=15), confirming previous observations of approximately 104 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with demand centering around 103 units. The most recent demand at Period 27 was 91 units. Following the carry-over insights, I will continue to focus on the post-stabilization regime (Period 12 to 27, N=16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed; therefore, L=0 is maintained. On-hand inventory is 61, and there are no in-transit units. By using recent_N=16, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the current stable mean (~103) and observed volatility in this regime, ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a very stable regime since Period 12. Analyzing the data from Period 12 to Period 28 (N=17), the mean demand is 103.88 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding within the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is 43 units, with 0 in-transit. I will use the recent_N method with N=17 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 0. This ensures the base stock calculation (for L=0) covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while respecting the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P28 average demand is 103.9 units (N=17, SD=30.6), consistent with previous observations of ~104 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the stable regime identified around Period 12. Analysis of demand from Period 12 to Period 29 (N=18) shows an average demand of 102.3 units with a standard deviation of 29.8. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P20-P29) have a mean of 95.4, which is slightly lower but consistent with the established range. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. The current on-hand inventory is 74 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to cover the stable regime since Period 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'default' (0) for lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining an appropriate safety buffer based on the observed volatility and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, following an initial period of high volatility. For the last 19 periods (P12-P30), the average demand is approximately 101.5 units with a standard deviation of 30.2. Recent periods (P26-P30) show an average of 90.2, but the broader post-P12 regime remains a more reliable predictor than a very small window. I am using N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while excluding the noisy first 11 periods. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods as promised, and I will maintain 'default' to reflect this. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0 means review period + lead time = 1 period of risk) while maintaining a buffer against the observed volatility (SD ~30).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P30 average demand is 101.5 units (N=19, SD=30.2), confirming the lower and more consistent demand profile compared to the start of the horizon.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of roughly 30 units. The most recent demand (P31) was 97 units, which is very close to this established average. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (arrivals occur in the same period as the order), I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the stable regime from Period 12 to Period 31 (N=20). This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistical profile to set the base stock level, balancing the relatively high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of around 30. The most recent samples (P30: 98, P31: 97, P32: 100) further confirm this stability. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the stable regime and the low holding cost ($1) relative to the high profit ($19), the OR engine should prioritize a high service level to capture demand while minimizing the risk of stockouts. I will use a window of the last 21 periods (P12-P32) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=default reflects the reliably observed lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P32 average demand is 101.9 units (N=21, SD=28.7), confirming a consistent demand profile of ~102 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2057.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be highly stable, following a regime that established itself around Period 12. Analysis of the demand from Period 12 through Period 33 shows an average of approximately 101.9 units per period with a standard deviation of 28.7. The most recent demand (P33) was 110 units, which is consistent with this regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history, meaning orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current period (P34), I will use the recent N = 22 samples (Period 12 to Period 33) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable period without the influence of the erratic early-game demand. Setting L to default (0) aligns with the observed lead time. The OR backend will use these parameters to compute a base-stock level that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost, aiming for a high service level (critical fractile ~0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P33 average demand is 102.3 units (N=22, SD=28.1), confirming a consistent demand profile since the Period 12 shift.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 12, with a mean around 102 units and moderate volatility. Over the last 23 periods (P12-P34), the average demand is 101.9 units. The most recent demand in Period 34 was 93 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Consequently, I am maintaining a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting with N=23 to capture this stable regime, and using 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the reliable 0-period delivery. This strategy ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the immediate demand while balancing the high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P34 average demand is 101.9 units (N=23, SD=27.7), maintaining the consistent demand profile observed since the Period 12 shift.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 12, following an initial period of volatility. Analytical evidence from the last 24 periods (P12-P35) shows a mean demand of approximately 101.9 units with a standard deviation around 27.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with successful same-period arrivals confirmed in the history (most recently in P35). For Period 36, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 to capture this stable post-shift regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand mean and variance while minimizing excess holding costs, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.95).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 12, fluctuating around a mean of approx 102 units with lower volatility than the initial periods. The 'Period 36 conclude' message confirms an arrival from the Period 36 order with a lead time of 0, maintaining the established pattern. For Period 37, I am using the stable regime from P12 onwards (N = 37 - 12 = 25 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Although the mean is calculated from 25 samples, N is capped at 20 as per instructions. On-hand inventory is 34, and with L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover Period 37's demand. The chosen parameters reflect the sustained demand regime observed over the last 25 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1656.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a specific regime since Period 12, with recent observations (P12-P37) showing a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 27.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units. To maintain the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) under a 0-period lead time, the OR backend needs to cover demand for the current review period (1+L=1). Using recent_N with N=26 (covering the stable regime from P12-P37) is appropriate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this sustained stability while filtering out the early horizon volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P37 average demand is 101.5 units (N=26, SD=27.2), consistent with the long-term stable profile of ~102 units since Period 12.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 27.2. All observed shipments have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the reliability of the promised lead time. For Period 39, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=27 (covering the stable regime from P12 to P38) to accurately capture the current demand profile while filtering out the high volatility seen in the first 11 periods. This will allow the OR backend to maintain an optimal base stock level that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost, ensuring high service levels during this stable phase.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, oscillating around a mean of ~101.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27-30. Recent history (P35-P39) shows daily demands of 97, 106, 89, 100, and 76, which are consistent with this long-term regime. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 62 units on hand and 0 in transit. To maintain the established service level and account for the stable demand profile, I will continue using a recent_N approach. I'll set N=28 to cover the stable regime since Period 12 (P12-P39, N=28), ensuring the OR backend captures the current mean and variance accurately for the (L+1) period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P39 average demand is 100.5 units (N=28, SD=26.4), slightly lower than the P12-P37 average but highly consistent with the established profile of ~101 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with a mean near 101 units and a low standard deviation. The last 29 periods (P12-P40) show an average demand of 100.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 26. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding in the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is 34 units, and there are no units in transit. To maintain the inventory target (base stock) while accounting for the current period's demand, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=29 to capture the entire stable regime. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P40 average demand is 100.6 units (N=29, SD=25.8), maintaining the consistent profile observed since Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1443.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a low standard deviation. The most recent observations (P39-P41) show demands of 76, 103, and 79, which align with this established profile. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival), the inventory strategy should focus on maintaining a base stock that covers the current period's demand with a service level buffer. I will use a recent_N of 30 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the stable regime from P12 onwards (N=30 periods since P12). This will provide the OR engine with the most accurate mean and variance for the current state, ensuring it targets the ~101 unit average while protecting against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P41 average demand is 99.9 units (N=30, SD=25.5), confirming the consistent long-term profile of ~100-101 units since Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1584.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained exceptionally stable since the regime shift around Period 12. Analysis of the most recent window (P12-P42, N=31) shows a mean demand of 99.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25.1. The current on-hand inventory is 50 units. Given the critical 0-period lead time, the OR backend needs to ensure that on-hand inventory plus the immediate order covers the upcoming period's demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=31 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 12. This provides the most robust statistical basis for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, balancing the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) against inventory costs. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P42 average demand is 99.4 units (N=31, SD=25.1), confirming the long-term stable profile of ~100 units since the Period 12 shift.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 99.4 units and a standard deviation of 25.1. The current on-hand inventory is 43 units, and there are no units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). I will use the established stable regime (Period 12-43) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which corresponds to N=32. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time. This strategy ensures sufficient stock to cover current period demand while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P43 average demand is 99.2 units (N=32, SD=24.7), confirming the long-term consistency around ~99-100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1846.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 99-100 units. The most recent period (P44) demand was 99, right on this long-term average. The lead time remains zero as confirmed by the 'Period 44 conclude' message (ordered P44, arrived P44). Given the stability over the last 33 periods, I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method with N=33 to capture this regime accurately. This period's inventory stands at 35 units on-hand, which is slightly below our targeted base stock level for a 95% service level (~141 units based on recent statistics). The OR backend's base stock calculation will automatically suggest an order to bring the inventory position up to this level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P44 average demand is 99.2 units (N=33, SD=24.3), reinforcing the long-term consistency around ~99 units since the Period 12 shift.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, with the average demand hovering around 99-100 units. Period 45 saw a slightly higher demand of 118 units, but this is within the expected variance of the current regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history, matching the promised lead time. I will continue to use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, with N=34 (the duration of the stable regime since Period 12) to capture the long-term stable mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as lead time is consistently 0. These parameters provide a robust base stock that balances the high service level requirement (95%) with the inventory holding cost for the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, fluctuating around a mean of approximately 100 units. The most recent demand at Period 46 was 107, which aligns with the established regime. As we move into the final periods (47-50), maintaining this consistent forecasting approach is key. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units, and lead time continues to be consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Based on the stability of the demand profile over the last 34 periods, I will use recent_N with N=34 to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire stable post-Period 12 regime, ensuring the OR backend has a robust estimate of both the mean demand (~99 units) and the volatility (SD ~24) to maintain the optimal service level while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: P12-P46 average demand is 99.4 units (N=35, SD=23.9), continuing the long-term consistency observed since the Period 12 shift.

Analysis of the most recent window (Periods 12-47) shows an average demand of approximately 99.4 units with a standard deviation of 23.9 units. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given that we are at Period 48 of a 50-period horizon, and both demand and lead time are stable, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=36 to capture the entire stable regime. This ensures the OR backend has the most accurate reflection of the current environment to calculate the base stock level, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost while maintaining a high service level.

Daily Profit: $2527.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the SKU experienced a stockout (demand 135 vs. inventory 133), leaving us with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit for Period 49. This is the penultimate period (49 of 50). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit in the final two periods while minimizing final ending inventory (which incurs holding costs but yields no future revenue), I need to cover Period 49's demand and set a baseline for Period 50. The demand regime has been highly stable around ~100 units since Period 12 (N=36). Specifically, the Period 12-48 average is 100.2. Given the stockout occurred because of a +1.4 sigma event (135 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=37 (covering P12 to P48) to capture this most recent stable regime and its slightly decreasing volatility, ensuring the OR engine has the best mean and standard deviation to calculate the base stock for the final stretch.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains remarkably stable: P12-P48 average demand is 100.2 units (N=37, SD=23.3), maintaining the consistent profile established mid-game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2045.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, centering around ~100 units. Period 49 demand was 109 units, and Period 48 saw a slight spike to 135 units, but the long-term average (N=37) is 100.2 units with a standard deviation of 23.3. As this is the final period (Period 50), the objective is to maximize profit from the immediate demand resolution while minimizing ending inventory (holding cost). Given the lead time is consistently 0, the order placed now will arrive and be sold within this period. On-hand inventory is 26 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=38 to capture the stable regime from Period 12 to 49 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the ~100 unit mean and ~23 unit standard deviation, allowing the OR backend to order just enough to meet expected demand plus a safety buffer, accounting for the current 26 units on hand.
