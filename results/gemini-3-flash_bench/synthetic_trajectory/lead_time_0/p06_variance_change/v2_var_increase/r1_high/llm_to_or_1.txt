Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I am observing initial demand data for Period 1 to 5. The demand across these first 5 periods is: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135. The mean is 106.4 and the standard deviation is 26.0. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since there is no prior arrival history or on-hand inventory, I need to set parameters based on the initial 5 samples to establish a baseline for the OR backend. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect this starting regime. I will use 'default' for L (0 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. The starting on-hand was 151, demand was 99, leaving 52 units. Historical demand across 5 samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) plus the actual Period 1 demand (99) shows a mean of approximately 105.17 and a standard deviation of approximately 23.6. Since L=0, the target base stock (calculated by the OR backend) will aim to cover demand for (L+1)=1 period. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the new Period 1 data point) to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use the observed L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1115.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (132, 74, 101, 90, 135 for P1-P5 in general samples, and specific observed demands of 99 and 63 in P1 and P2) suggests a mean demand around 100. However, the game history only provides two specific realized demand points (99, 63). To set a safe stock level, I will use all 5 available samples from the 'Historical Demand Data' section to estimate mu and sigma, as the sample size is small and no significant regime shift is yet apparent. Using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with L=0 will allow the OR backend to use all provided historical samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1176.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals for periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm this (all arrived in the same period they were ordered). Demand over the first three periods has been 99, 63, and 66, with a mean of 76. This is significantly lower than the provided pre-game historical samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) which averaged 106.4. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost suggests a ~95% cycle service level), I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual seen demand pattern, and default to the promised lead time (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1551.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the first 4 periods (order arrives same period). Demand samples provided in history are P1: 132, P2: 74, P3: 101, P4: 90, P5: 135. However, comparing these to the 'sold' units in the game history (P1: 99, P2: 63, P3: 66, P4: 83), there is a discrepancy between the provided historical demand data and the actual resolved demand in the game. I will prioritize the actual observations from Period 1 to 4 to set my parameters. The mean demand over P1-P4 is 77.75 and the standard deviation is approximately 15.6. Given L=0, mu_hat should target one period of demand. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand environment observed in the conclude messages. Current on-hand is 26, which is low relative to recent demand (83 in P4), so the OR backend should trigger an order to restore the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1194.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout the first 5 periods (all orders arrived within the same period). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some variation (range 63-99). The historical mean demand across the first 5 periods is 75.2 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. Given the short history and the stability of the lead time (0 periods), I'll use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime while allowing for slight fluctuations. The lead time (L) remains at the default of 0. These parameters should maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1879.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-6 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for the last 6 periods has been somewhat variable (99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99) with an average of 79.16. The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 7. Given the variance in demand, I will use all 6 available data points to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable baseline for the OR engine's base-stock calculation while acknowledging the zero lead-time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2012.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods across all 7 historical periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples from Period 1 to Period 7 are [99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106]. The demand appears relatively stable with minor fluctuations, showing a slight uptick in the most recent two periods (99 and 106). Since there are only 7 periods of data and no clear regime shift yet, I will use all available historical demand samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 'calculate' will correctly utilize the observed 0-period lead time. Parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set to 'default' to capture the 1+L (1 period) demand distribution, ensuring the order covers upcoming demand while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a significant stockout: we had 133 units available (2 from previous period + 131 ordered/arrived) but demand was 165, resulting in 32 lost sales. The demand in Period 8 (165) is a sharp increase compared to the previous 7 periods (avg ~83). The product is 'chips(Regular)', and while we lack specific calendar dates, this spike suggest a potential regime shift or seasonal event. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent demand data to capture this upward shift and prevent further stockouts. I'm choosing N=3 for demand and volatility to weigh the recent growth (99, 106, 165) more heavily while maintaining base stock levels that account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 8: demand spiked to 165 units compared to previous average of 83 (+98%), leading to a stockout of 32 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2477.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10. The historical demand data (provided separately) and the gameplay history show a significant shift. For Periods 1-7, demand averaged approximately 83 units. Starting in Period 8, demand spiked to 165, and Period 9 recorded 133 units. This confirms the carry-over insight of a regime shift. I am setting L to 'calculate' because the history consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus exclusively on the new high-demand regime (Periods 8 and 9 average: 149). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=2 to capture the current volatility (std of 165 and 133 is ~22.6). This higher base stock will prevent further stockouts given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2093.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift. Prior to Period 8, the average demand was approximately 83 units (Periods 1-7). Starting from Period 8, demand significantly increased: Period 8 (165), Period 9 (133), and Period 10 (114), establishing a new average of approximately 137 units. This represents a 65% increase. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout all 10 completed cycles. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in the transition (especially the P8 spike). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current mean (~137) and higher standard deviation, prioritizing service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8-10 average is 137 units, up from Period 1-7 average of 83 (+65%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1680.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 8. The initial periods (P1-P7) averaged roughly 83 units/period. The subsequent burst (P8-P10) reached a peak of 165 and an average of 137, but the most recent observation in Period 11 (93 units) suggests the demand may be stabilizing or partially receding from that peak. However, it remains higher than the P2-P5 lows. To balance the risk of stockouts during this high-volatility period against holding costs, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) which covers the entirety of the high-demand regime. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered), so L=0 is maintained. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using N=4 to capture this recent higher-mean, higher-variance regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2503.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 8. In the 12 periods observed, the first 7 periods averaged 83 units, while the most recent 5 periods (Period 8-12) averaged 127.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. To prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 8, I will use a window of the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher demand level and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current trend rather than the lower historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 8-12 average is 128 units, compared to Period 1-7 average of 83 units (+54% increase).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 8. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 8-13), the average demand is 126.33 units per period. Prior to Period 8, the average was approximately 83 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded cycles. Currently, on-hand inventory is 53 units with zero in-transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime (Period 8 to 13). For lead time L, I will use 'default' as it aligns with the consistently observed lead time of 0 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 8. Initially, the demand mean was approximately 83 units (Periods 1-7). Since Period 8, the demand has significantly increased and stabilized. The demand values from Period 8 to Period 14 are: 165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119, and 111. The mean for these last 7 periods is approximately 124.1. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history showing the order arrived in the same period it was placed. To capture this new, higher demand level while allowing for the standard deviation observed in the recent regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant statistics from the current demand state (approx 124 units/period) rather than being pulled down by the lower historical data from Periods 1-7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1158.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The demand regime shift previously noted between Periods 8-13 (averaging around 128) seems to have cooled down in recent periods. Specifically, Period 15 saw a significant drop to 66 units, while the average demand from Period 11 to 15 is approximately 96.6 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (quantile \u2248 0.95). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering Periods 8-15) to capture the higher-demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. Using recent_N=8 balances the older spikes with the more recent moderate demand, ensuring the base stock level remains responsive but prepared for intermittent spikes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we analyze the current state of 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand shows a clear regime shift after Period 7. The demand for Periods 1-7 averaged 83.0, while the demand for Periods 8-16 averages 117.1. Recently, demand has shown some volatility (high: 134, low: 66), but the mean remains higher than the initial phase. The Promised Lead Time is 0, and all shipments to date have arrived with an actual lead time of 0 (L=0). Profit ($19.0) vs. Holding Cost ($1.0) results in a critical ratio of 0.95, justifying a high service level. Since L=0, mu_hat should cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. I am selecting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire post-shift regime (Period 8 to 16) to provide a stable estimate of the current demand level and its historical variance within this higher-demand bracket.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting in Period 8. The average demand from Period 1 to Period 7 was approximately 83 units. Since Period 8, demand has increased and stabilized at a higher level. Specifically, the average demand from Period 8 to Period 17 is approximately 120.3 units across 10 samples (165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119, 111, 66, 115, 118). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation properly reflects the increased mean and sustained volatility observed since Period 8.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current on-hand inventory is 118 units with no in-transit stock. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Demand shifted around Period 8; the average demand from Period 8 to Period 18 is approximately 113.6 units per period, compared to the early average of ~83. However, demand in Period 18 dropped significantly to 42 units. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat) with N=11 (covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 8 onward) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the sustained higher volume while smoothing out the Period 18 outlier. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=11 to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1355.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct regime shift that occurred around Period 8. Before Period 8, mean demand was approximately 83 units. From Period 8 to Period 19, the average demand increased to approximately 107 units, although recent volatility is high (ranging from 42 to 134 in the last 10 periods). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same execution cycle. To capture the current (post-shift) demand level while accounting for recent high variance, I will use a recent_N window of 12 (covering the entire period since the shift at P8). This approach ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher demand regime while smoothing out the noise from the most recent dips (P18-19). L remains default at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2837.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant shift starting at Period 8. Prior to Period 8, the average demand was approximately 83 units. From Period 8 to Period 20, the average demand increased to approximately 109.2 units, though with notable volatility (ranging from 42 to 165). The most recent period (P20) saw a spike to 150 units, leaving on-hand inventory at a low of 13 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this higher average demand and the volatility observed in the current regime (Periods 8-20, length=13), I will set N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This helps the OR backend establish a base stock level that covers the higher mean while holding enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 8-20 confirms a higher mean of ~109 units with increased volatility compared to early periods (P1-7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2113.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime established around Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 21 is approximately 109.8 units, compared to the early period (P1-7) average of 83 units. Recent demand has shown significant fluctuations, with a peak of 150 (P20) and a recent value of 114 (P21). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With On-hand inventory at 53 and no units in transit, I will use recent_N=14 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime (Periods 8-21) while smoothing out the volatility seen in individual weeks like P18 (42) and P20 (150). This setting (L=0, N=14) ensures the base stock calculation reflects current mean and variance, which the OR backend will then use to determine the optimal order to cover Period 22's demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 8, increasing the average from ~83 to ~105 units per period. Recent demand has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from 41 to 150 across the last five periods (Average P18-22: 84.6). Despite this recent dip, the overall regime since Period 8 remains higher than the initial phase. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the post-shift distribution (starting Period 8) while providing enough historical context to buffer against the current volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will use the default setting. With on-hand inventory at 124 and high volatility, the OR backend's 95% service level target (q=19/20) will prioritize avoiding stockouts during potential demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $954.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift in the last two periods (P22: 41, P23: 56), which is substantially lower than the Period 8-21 average (~110). While the long-term regime shift noted in Period 21 remains relevant, the most current data suggests a cooling phase or high volatility. Given the 'chips(Regular)' description and generic 'Period' naming, I am treating this as a volatility shift rather than a permanent seasonal drop. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the environment since the major shift at Period 8, balancing the long-term increased mean against the recent low-demand outliers. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), so L=0 is maintained. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher historical variance while beginning to adjust for the lower recent demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 22, with recent 2-period average (48.5) being less than half of the Period 8-21 average (~110).

=== Period 24 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=55, arrived=55 units (ordered on Period 24, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=165, demand=150, sold=150, ending on-hand inventory=15
Daily Profit: $2850.00, Daily Holding Cost: $15.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2835.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand spiked to 150 units, significantly higher than the low demands seen in Periods 22-23 (41 and 56). This confirms that while mean demand has fluctuated, volatility is very high. Period 25 starts with only 15 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period to meet this period's demand. To avoid a stockout in this volatile regime, I need to set parameters that capture both the long-term average since the Period 8 shift (~105 units) and the high recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering Period 8-24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances the higher mean period (P8-21) with the most recent high-variance data (P22-24). Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high: after a two-period lull (avg 48.5), demand returned to 150 units in Period 24. High safety stock is required to prevent stockouts during these peaks.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 26, the current context shows a highly volatile demand regime. While the average since Period 8 is approximately 105 units, the recent four-period demand (41, 56, 150, 83) highlights significant fluctuations. The promised lead time continues to hold at 0 periods as verified by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the high-volatility regime starting at Period 8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the higher mean and volatility of the current regime while discounting the earlier, lower-demand periods (P1-P7). This should provide enough safety stock to handle the observed spikes (up to 150 units) while remaining responsive to the recent average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3154.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility and a significant upward trend in peaks. In Period 26, demand reached 167 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 166, ending on-hand 0). This follows a pattern of high-amplitude swings (e.g., P22: 41, P24: 150, P25: 83, P26: 167). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is approximately 108.5 units, but the standard deviation has increased significantly. Given the 0-period lead time, we must ensure enough 'base_stock' is ordered at the start of each period to cover the same-day demand spike. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. I will use the recent 6-period average to set mu_hat, but I will explicitly set a higher sigma_hat to account for the frequent spikes nearing 170 units, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough service level (q=0.95) to prevent recurring stockouts during these high-demand pulses.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand volatility intensified in Period 26 with a peak of 167 units (+101% vs P25), leading to a stockout. High-demand pulses are now frequently exceeding 150 units, requiring elevated safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $847.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extremely high volatility, characterized by sharp peaks (P26: 167 units) followed by significant drops (P27: 52 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 27 conclude' message. Since Period 8, mean demand has shifted upwards to approximately 107 units, but the high variance necessitates a strategy that accounts for frequent pulses exceeding 150 units. In Period 27, an order of 193 was placed, resulting in an ending inventory of 141 units. To maintain sufficient safety stock for potential immediate spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs during 'lull' periods, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=20 (covering the higher-demand regime since P8) will capture the elevated mean (~107) and the significant standard deviation (~39). This informs the OR backend to set a base stock level sufficient to cover these 150-170 unit peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2089.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and recurring peaks, as evidenced by the Period 26 demand of 167 and the subsequent drop to 52 in Period 27, followed by a rise to 113 in Period 28. The carry-over insights correctly identify a higher mean since Period 8 (approx. 104-110 units) with significant pulses. Currently, on-hand inventory is 58 units with 0 in-transit. With a 0-period lead time, we must ensure our base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) covers the likely high-demand scenario for Period 29. Using the recent_N method with N=21 (from Period 8 to 28) captures this 'new' regime's mean and high variance better than the full history or a very short window. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the frequent spikes near 150-170 units seen in Periods 20, 24, and 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3230.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the SKU experienced a stockout with demand reaching 188 units (the highest recorded in history), surpassing the available 170 units on-hand. This confirms the 'high-demand pulse' pattern mentioned in recent carry-over insights, where demand volatility has significantly intensified. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is ~114, but the standard deviation is very high, with peaks frequently exceeding 150 (P20, P24, P26, P29). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently actualized, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the recent high volatility and mean shift, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the higher average of 114. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the extreme fluctuations (ranging from 41 to 188) and ensure the OR backend generates sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during these volatile peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 29 (188 units), confirming a sustained regime of high-magnitude pulses (150+ units) occurring approximately every 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1123.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant pulses exceeding 150 units (P24: 150, P26: 167, P29: 188). The current period (P31) follows a lower-demand period (P30: 66), which historically precedes a potential spike within 1-2 periods based on the pulse pattern identified in 'Carry-over insights'. Since the lead time is consistent at 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the increased mean and volatility of this current regime, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9. This N-value covers the period from the P22 volatility shift to the present (P22-P30), ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the lower troughs and the aggressive peaks. This approach maintains a high 'base stock' level to buffer against the 150-190 unit spikes, while the Profit ($19) vs. Holding Cost ($1) ratio naturally supports a high service level (q \u2248 0.95).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant pulses around 150-190 units occurring periodically (e.g., P24, P26, P29). In Period 31, demand was 92 units, which is moderate compared to the recent peak of 188 in P29. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the high variance and prevent stockouts during the next likely demand pulse, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 130 (reflecting a higher mean for the current volatile regime) and sigma_hat to an explicit value of 55 to capture the frequent spikes exceeding 160 units. This approach increases the base stock to accommodate the 'peaky' nature of the demand while maintaining the 0-period lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant pulses exceeding 150 units occurring every few periods (P24: 150, P26: 167, P29: 188). Although the most recent demands (P31: 92, P32: 135) are closer to the long-term average, history since Period 24 indicates that a stockout risk is high if we don't prepare for the 150+ pulses. The actual lead time remains 0. I will continue using recent_N (N=9, covering P24-P32) to capture this high-volatility regime. This includes the major spikes and the lulls, providing a mean and standard deviation that reflect the current pulse-heavy demand pattern. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the next potential 150-190 unit peak while minimizing excessive holding costs during lower-demand periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with high-magnitude pulses (e.g., 188 in P29, 135 in P32, 115 in P33). We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 24-26, characterized by frequent peaks exceeding 150 units. While the average over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is approximately 118 units, the high variance (standard deviation ~48) necessitates a high safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand pulses. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture the recent volatility and elevated mean, I will use a recent window of N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the current volatile regime while providing enough samples to estimate variance reliably. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, oscillating between low troughs (e.g., 52 units in P34) and high peaks (e.g., 188 units in P29). Since Period 25, the demand has averaged approximately 101 units but with a very high standard deviation. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 137 units and the 0-period lead time, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the potential for a high-demand pulse in the upcoming period without overstocking during the frequent lulls. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent high-volatility regime (P25-P34) for both mean and standard deviation, ensuring safety stock is sufficient for peaks exceeding 150 units while respecting the 0-period lead time logic.

The recent demand context shows high volatility with periodic pulses exceeding 150 units (P24: 150, P26: 167, P29: 188), interspersed with lower demand periods (P34-35 avg: 53.5). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P21-P35) is approximately 101 units, but the standard deviation is significantly elevated due to these spikes. Since Period 30, the demand has been: 66, 92, 135, 115, 52, 55. This suggests we are currently in a lower-demand trough following the P29/P32 activity. However, given the product (chips) and the pattern of pulses every 3-5 periods, another spike is likely imminent. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime while providing a stable baseline. For sigma_hat, I will also use a recent_N of 15 to ensure the OR engine maintains a high safety stock to buffer against the 150+ unit pulses that have caused stockouts previously. The observed lead time is consistently 0, so L remains 'default'.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with pulsed peaks. Recent demand in Period 36 was 113 units, following a lower demand phase (P34: 52, P35: 55). Historically, these lower periods are often followed by a transition back to high-magnitude pulses (e.g., P32: 135, P29: 188, P26: 167). Current on-hand inventory is 62 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must ensure that the base stock (on-hand + current order) covers the potential for a high-intensity demand spike in the current period (Period 37). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P22-P36) is approximately 101 units, but the high-demand state averages closer to 150 units. To capture this volatility and prevent stockouts during surge periods while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a critical ratio ~0.95), I will use the recent 15 periods to calculate both the mean and the standard deviation. This N=15 window captures the current high-volatility regime better than the full history, providing a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the frequent 150+ unit spikes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a pulsed pattern. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the mean demand is 106.6 units, but with significant swings between 52 and 188 units. This confirms the regime identified in Period 30. The most recent demand (P37) was 137 units, consuming most of the available stock and leaving only 38 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical fractile ~0.95), I will use the last 10 periods to capture the current high-volatility mean and variance, ensuring the OR engine orders enough to cover potential spikes above 150 units while accounting for the low on-hand balance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a cyclic pulse pattern. Recent demand peaks exceeded 180 units (P29), followed by a variable period of lower demand (P34-P38 average: 83.8). We are currently in a lower demand phase (P38: 62), but based on the history starting from Period 24, a significant spike is likely imminent (pulses of 130-180 every few periods). Lead time remains consistently 0. To capture the current average while maintaining a high safety stock to prevent stockouts during the next pulse, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the period from the P26/P27 transition). This window reflects the heightened volatility of the current regime while capturing the average demand of approximately 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3211.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we experienced another stockout due to a high-demand pulse of 184 units, which confirms the pattern noted in Carry-over Insights (pulses of 150+ units every 2-3 periods). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. With a promised lead time of 0 (actual lead time has consistently been 0), we must order enough to satisfy Period 40's demand and buffer against these recurring high pulses. The recent demand (Period 22-39) shows high volatility with a mean around 104 units but significant peaks (150, 167, 188, 184). Since profit ($19) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the high-volatility regime since Period 22) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat set to 50 to ensure the backend's base-stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers the upper bound of the observed pulses (~180-190 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: High-demand pulse pattern confirmed with 184 units in Period 39. Pulses exceeding 150 units occur roughly every 3-5 periods (P24, P26, P29, P39) necessitating high safety stock despite lulls.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern shows a sustained high-demand regime with frequent pulses exceeding 150 units (P39: 184, P40: 156). Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average demand is 114.6 units with significant volatility. The current on-hand inventory is low (30 units) following two periods of high demand. Given the promised lead time (L=0) and the demonstrated risk of stockouts during these peaks (P39), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (since Period 28) to capture this recent high-volatility, high-mean behavior while ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover potential pulses of ~180-190 units. The OR backend uses a high service level target (critical ratio ~0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit margin and relatively low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3530.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 39-41) shows a significant escalation in demand, with values of 184, 156, and 186 units respectively. This indicates a sustained high-demand regime, distinct from the intermittent pulse pattern previously identified. The current average over the last 3 periods is 175.3, compared to the longer-term average. Furthermore, Period 41 ended with only 4 units on-hand, and there is no inventory currently in-transit, leaving the system highly vulnerable to a stockout in Period 42. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will set L to 'default'. To capture this aggressive new mean and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. To account for the intensified volatility accompanying these high-demand periods, I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the range from Period 37-41) to ensure a robust safety stock buffer reflected in the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 39: 3-period average (P39-P41) is 175.3 units, representing a significant shift from previous pulse patterns and necessitating higher inventory targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant shift to a higher-demand regime starting Period 39. The 4-period average (P39-P42) is now 154 units (184, 156, 186, 90), compared to the previous pulse patterns. Despite the dip to 90 in Period 42, the preceding three periods were consistently above 150, indicating a sustained increase in both volume and volatility. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1 (critical ratio \u2248 0.95), the system must prioritize high service levels to avoid stockouts during these new peaks. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this higher mean of ~154 units per period across the review + lead time (L=0). I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed over the last ten periods, ensuring the safety stock is robust enough for the frequent 180+ unit spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility, high-magnitude regime starting around Period 39. The 5-period average (P39-P43) is 148 units, but individual peaks reaching ~185 units (P39, P41) are frequent. Currently, on-hand inventory is 114 units with no units in transit. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to ensure local base stock covers the potential for another peak. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the current high-demand regime (~148 per period). Given the target service level q = 0.95 (19/(19+1)), this will set a base stock roughly equal to the mean plus ~1.65 standard deviations. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively represents the expected demand for the current period step. Historical sigma has also increased during this period, so recent_N=5 for sigma_hat is appropriate to maintain sufficient safety stock against further spikes above 180 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1804.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime. Since the confirmed shift at Period 39, demand has frequently exceeded 150 units (P39: 184, P40: 156, P41: 186). The recent six-period average (P39-P44) is approximately 140.2 units with significant variance. Although demand in the last three periods (P42-P44) has been lower (avg = 105), history shows that these 'lulls' are often followed by sharp peaks. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the primary goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the potential for a 180+ unit peak in the current period while managing holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime established since Period 39, and a recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in this same window. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the recurring demand pulses.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: High-demand regime (P39-P44) average is 140.2 units with peaks reaching 186. Short-term lulls (P42-P44 avg 105) are common between pulses.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime. Since Period 39, we have seen a significant shift with pulses reaching up to 186 units (P41, P45) and a sustained average of approximately 140 units. The current on-hand inventory is low (53 units) following a demand of 156 units in Period 45. To prevent stockouts during the next pulse\u2014which historically occurs every 3-5 periods\u2014we must maintain a high base stock. Since actual lead time remains 0 across all 45 periods, I will continue using the default lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 7 (P39-P45) to capture this latest high-demand regime specifically (average ~142.4). For volatility (sigma_hat), I am using a recent_N of 7 to ensure the backend accounts for the high standard deviation observed in this period range (approx 39.5) to satisfy the high service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent pulse-heavy regime. In Period 46, we observed a significant drop in demand to 24 units, which is a common lull following high-demand periods (like Period 45's 156 units). However, the overall regime since Period 39 remains elevated, with an average demand of approximately 125 units over the last 8 periods (P39-P46) and peaks up to 186. Even with the current high on-hand inventory of 182 units, the 'chips' category's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level to capture erratic demand spikes. I will use the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this recent higher-volume and high-volatility regime. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate the base stock to cover current period demand plus a safety factor derived from this recent variance. The recent N approach allows the model to react to the increased mean and standard deviation observed in the P39-P46 window.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand remains erratic with a significant lull in P46 (24 units) following a high-demand phase (P39-P45 avg: 140). Sustained high-volatility regime since P39 maintains an average of ~125 units despite isolated lulls.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows high demand volatility with a recent pulse pattern. After a sharp lull in Period 46 (24 units), demand recovered to 113 in Period 47. We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 39, with an average of approximately 125 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend's service level target (critical ratio) is high (0.95), which is appropriate given the frequent pulses exceeding 150 units. To capture the current regime's mean while accounting for recent fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=9 (covering the period from the P39 shift to now). This provides a representative mu and sigma for the OR backend to set a base stock that survives the next potential pulse near the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1769.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent average of ~114 units (P39-P48). Although some periods show lulls (e.g., P46 at 24 units), the frequency of pulses exceeding 150 units (P39, P40, P41, P45) remains a significant risk. With the on-hand inventory at 112 units and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently realized as 0 in history), the priority is to maintain a buffer to absorb these high-magnitude pulses. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 39 (average ~123 in this window). To account for the intensified volatility (demand ranging from 24 to 186 in the last 10 periods), I am setting sigma_hat with N=10 to ensure a robust safety stock. This approach balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost by ensuring we don't stock out during the next potential pulse.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2195.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is characterized by a high-volatility regime that began around Period 39. Since that period, the average demand is 119.1 units (P39-P49), with significant pulses exceeding 150 units occurring every few periods (e.g., P39, P40, P41, P45). The most recent three periods (P47-P49) show a stabilizing trend with demand at 113, 99, and 120 (avg 110.7), but history suggests a high risk of sudden spikes. Given the 0-period lead time, we need to ensure the base stock covers potential pulses while managing holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the average since the Period 39 regime shift (N=11) to capture the elevated mean of ~120 units. Sigma_hat will also use N=11 to reflect the intensified variance observed in this high-pulse regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0.
