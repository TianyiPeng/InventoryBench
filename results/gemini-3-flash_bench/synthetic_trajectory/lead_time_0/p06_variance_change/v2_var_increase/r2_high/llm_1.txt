Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show a mean demand of approximately 106.4 units per period with significant variance. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's expected demand plus a safety margin to account for the observed volatility.

Based on the historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) and the Period 1 realized demand (130), the average demand is approximately 110 units per period. Since the lead time is 0, my order in Period 2 will arrive before the demand resolution of Period 2. To cover Period 2's demand and maintain a small safety stock while minimizing holding costs (which are $1/unit), I need to target an available inventory level slightly above the historical average. I will target an inventory level of approximately 130 to 140 units. Currently, I have 10 units on-hand and 0 in-transit.

Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) based on Period 1 and 2 performance. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Since the system execution order adds the current period's order to on-hand inventory BEFORE demand resolution, I need to order enough to cover Period 3's demand.

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility with recent spikes exceeding 140 units (P49 demand: 148, P45: 163). The average demand since Period 43 is approximately 84 units, but the high variance (0 to 163) makes relying on the mean risky. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P49 order arrived same-period). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the trend shows frequent peaks near 150-170 units, I must order enough to cover a potential high-demand event in the current period. A target stock level of 170 units has proven useful in preventing deep stockouts during these peaks while balancing the $1 holding cost. Therefore, I will order 170 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand volatility remains the dominant characteristic: Period 49 demand spike of 148 confirms that the regime is still prone to high-demand events (140+) despite intermittent lower demand periods.",
