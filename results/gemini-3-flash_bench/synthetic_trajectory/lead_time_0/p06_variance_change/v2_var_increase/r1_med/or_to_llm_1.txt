Period 1 actual demand was 99, which is close to the mean. 3. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 96 units based on L=0. Its calculation uses a base stock level (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) and then caps it. With \u03bc \u2248 106, the OR recommendation of 96 seems slightly conservative due to the cap mechanism. Given the current on-hand of 30, we need enough stock to cover Period 2's demand (expected ~106). 4. Final Strategy: To maintain a safe service level and avoid stockouts (since demand often exceeds 100), I will round the OR recommendation up slightly to 100 units.

I will continue to assume L=0.\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 47 units. Historical demand across the last 28 periods has shifted from an initial mean (~106) to a much more volatile state. From P20 onward, we've seen spikes of 150, 150, 83, 167, 52, and 113.

OR Baseline Evaluation: The OR recommendation is 83 units. Adding this to the 47 on-hand units gives a total availability of 130 units. Given that we have seen demand hit 150+ in three of the last nine periods, 130 units carries a significant risk of a stockout.\n4.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual performance (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. The demand analysis shows a higher-level stabilization since Period 39 (averaging ~175 in that brief window), but more recent periods (P46-P48) have shown a significant drop (averaging ~78). The OR recommendation of 99 units is based on the long-term historical mean (including the early low-demand periods) and does not fully account for the high volatility observed between P39 and P48. Given that this is Period 49 of 50, I must ensure enough stock for the final two periods (current P49 and the final P50), while avoiding excessive holding costs for any leftover inventory after P50. Demand in the last few periods has been 24, 113, and 99. Splitting the difference between the 175-unit 'high' phase and the recent 'lower' phase suggests a target stock level around 130-140 per period. To cover the current period (P49) and remain semi-prepared for P50, I will order 120 units. This brings available inventory to 160 units, which safely covers the OR's estimated demand plus a safety margin for a potential return to the 150+ unit spikes.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time analysis: Orders consistently arrive with a 0-period lead time (same-period arrival), as confirmed by history through Period 49. Inventory analysis: Current on-hand is 40 units with 0 in-transit. Demand analysis: The historical average has shifted significantly over time. While the original mean was ~106, a regime shift noted in Period 42 established a new average of ~175. However, the last four periods (P46-P49) have seen a cool-down with demands of 24, 113, 99, and 120 (avg ~89). The OR recommendation of 99 units reflects this recent softening and the long-term historical mean. Strategy: Given the high volatility of this SKU (chips), a conservative buffer is needed. Following the OR recommendation of 99 units provides a target stock level of 139 (40 on-hand + 99 order), which is sufficient for the recent demand trend but protects profit margins if the lower demand persists. This is the final period (Period 50), so over-ordering carries high holding cost risk without future sales to offset it.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Maintaining OR recommendation of 99 units; demand has softened recently (avg ~89 over last 4 periods) compared to previous spikes, and this quantity avoids excessive holding costs in the final period.",
