This suggests a bi-modal pattern where high spikes (>180) occur every 2-3 periods. The OR recommendation of 160 is based on historical averages (including the lower-demand periods) and is capped to prevent over-ordering. However, given that the last period's demand (199) exceeded the capping logic and resulted in a stockout (selling 135 out of 199), 160 units may be insufficient if another spike occurs. I will follow the OR recommendation of 160 but recognize it as a minimum safety level in this volatile environment. I am choosing not to exceed the OR cap significantly because the holding cost is $1.00 relative to $19.00 profit; while 160 units covers the 'high' regime average fairly well, going higher risks a large holding cost if demand returns to the 'low' regime (16-39 units seen in P26-27).",

  "rationale": "1. Lead-time inference: Historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is currently at 141 units. Demand in recent periods has been extremely volatile, oscillating between spikes near 200 units (e.g., P43: 192, P46: 159, P47: 162) and sharp drops (e.g., P44: 1, P48: 59). We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period. 3. Final Strategy: To maximize profit for the final two periods (49 and 50), we must ensure enough stock for a potential final spike while minimizing ending inventory in Period 50 to avoid holding costs. The OR recommendation of 41 units targets a total availability of 182 (141 + 41), which is a safe buffer against the ~180-200 unit spikes observed. Since lead time is 0, any units ordered now replenish inventory immediately for Period 49 demand. Given the proximity to the game end, I will follow the OR recommendation to maintain a safe but not excessive inventory level for the final two periods.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 36, demand has transitioned into a highly volatile regime with frequent spikes between 150-200 units (seen in P36, P38, P39, P43, P45, P46, P47, P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38. The demand in Period 49 was 144, and we have seen sequences of high-demand periods (e.g., P45-P47). To minimize the risk of a stockout in this high-volatility environment while considering the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a base stock level near the maximum observed demand (~200) is optimal. The OR recommendation is 145 units, but this may be insufficient if we encounter another 160-200 unit spike immediately following Period 49's 144. I will order 162 units to bring total available stock to 200 (the effective capacity observed in history), ensuring we can satisfy even the highest observed demand spikes.",
