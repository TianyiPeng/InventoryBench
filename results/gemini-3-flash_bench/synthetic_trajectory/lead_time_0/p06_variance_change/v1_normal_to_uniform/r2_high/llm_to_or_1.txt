Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with an empty inventory. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which we see as hindsight data) shows a mean of 98.2 (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). However, at Period 1, we must act on the first available sample or the overall mean provided in the prompt's historical context. The demand shows some volatility (std dev ~26). Using 'default' methods will allow the backend to use all 5 provided samples to calculate the base stock for the current (L=0) and one future review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 142 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), demand was 121, leaving 21 units on hand. Historical demand over 5 periods is: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The mean is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 26.5. Since we only have 5 samples and the promised lead time of 0 is currently matching the observed lead time, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current demand cluster. The OR engine will calculate base_stock based on profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to achieve a high service level (~95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1598.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 55. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods is holding true (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in the same period). Historical demand for the first two periods was 121 and 87 (avg: 104). The additional historical data provided in the prompt shows Period 1: 122, Period 2: 121, Period 3: 60, Period 4: 83, Period 5: 105. Since I am currently making the decision for Period 3, I only 'know' the realized demand for periods 1 and 2 (121 and 87 respectively). Demand appears to be softening compared to the initial sample (122), but it is too early to confirm a sustained regime shift. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as 0 is confirmed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N approach (N=2) to slightly favor the more recent lower demand observations while maintaining enough stock to cover lead time + 1 period (current period demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1776.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the first three periods. Demand has shown some fluctuation: Period 1 (121), Period 2 (87), and Period 3 (96), with the user-provided sample history showing earlier values of 122 and 121. The mean demand across all visible periods (including samples P1-P5 provided in prompt and actuals P1-P3) is approximately 101. Currently, on-hand inventory is 48. Since the lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To maximize reward while avoiding stockouts, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (avg ~101). Given L=0, the OR backend will calculate base_stock for 1 period of demand (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1589.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe demand history for the first 4 periods: 121, 87, 96, 86. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-4 arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0). There are currently 45 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The mean demand over the first 4 periods is approximately 97.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.0. Since demand has been relatively stable around 90-100 units without a major trend or seasonal signal visible yet in the data provided, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current demand baseline. This sets parameters to maintain a service level appropriate for the $19/$1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, inventory dropped to 0 because demand (140) exceeded the available on-hand (125). Historical demand samples show Period 1: 121, Period 2: 87, Period 3: 96, Period 4: 86, and Period 5: 140. While there's a spike in Period 5, it is not yet confirmed as a sustained regime shift. The actual lead time consistently confirms the promised lead time of 0 periods (order arrives same period). Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To recover and mitigate potential stockouts if the Period 5 spike continues, I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation calculations over the available 5 periods to capture recent volatility. L remains at the default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1515.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the order arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand history shows a recent spike in Period 5 (140 units), which led to a stockout. The mean demand across all 6 periods is approximately 102.17 units, but the last 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average of 103, and the last 2 show 111.5. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 19/20 = 0.95. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent volatility and higher demand average, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a safe service level based on the full sample volatility. Parameters are set to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers the next period's demand appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some fluctuation, specifically a spike in Period 5 (140 units) which resulted in a stockout. However, the last two periods (Period 6 and 7) have seen demand stabilize lower at 83 and 77 units respectively. The historical demand data (seed periods) and subsequent observation periods (Period 1 to 7) show a mean demand of approximately 97.8 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent performance including the stockout event and the recent dip, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a safe buffer against the observed volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on a high service level (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit margin and relatively low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2382.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand shows considerable volatility (range: 77-140). The average demand over all available periods (P1-P8) is approximately 102 units/period. The most recent demand (P8) was 126, which is higher than the lifetime average, though Period 7 was quite low (77). There is no clear sustained regime shift yet, as the high demand in P5 was followed by a lower P6 and P7. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period. Inventory is currently low (12 units on hand). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent variability while smoothing out the noise, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so L+1=1 period). Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent standard deviation, which is relatively high due to the swings between 77 and 140.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1790.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 53 units with zero in-transit. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-9), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand appears to fluctuate between approximately 80 and 140 units, with a mean around 100. There was a stockout in Period 5 when demand hit 140 and on-hand was only 125, suggesting a need for a slightly higher safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the average demand of the entire played history (approx 101.5), and 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is stable at 0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 10 periods with a mean of 101.6 units. The most recent demand (Period 10) was 102 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments or overdue orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent lead time data of 0 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that targets a high service level (profit/profit+holding = 19/20 = 95%).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 103 units per period (Periods 1-11). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in every single concluded period. Current on-hand inventory is low (22 units) relative to the average demand. Because the demand is relatively stable without clear seasonal spikes or regime shifts in the last few periods (recent demands: 126, 97, 102, 114), I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the current trend while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 0. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 will base the target stock on a (1+0) * mean of ~108 units, which combined with the OR backend's service level logic (q ~ 0.95), should provide sufficient coverage for the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1666.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 101.7 units. The last 5 periods (P8-P12) show a similar average (105.8). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 44 units. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full recent history of the game, as the provided historical samples (P_1 to P_5) showed slightly different behavior than the dynamic game history. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-13) for chips(Regular) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 102.3 units. In Period 13, the demand was 111, leaving 23 units on hand. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To ensure sufficient stock for Period 14 (taking into account the 1-period lookahead logic of L+1), I will use the last 13 periods to estimate the demand mean and standard deviation. Using N=13 for mu_hat captures the relevant history from the start of the game, as there hasn't been a clear regime shift since the initial data points. L is set to 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 102 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 39 units, with no units in transit. Since L=0 and the backend's base stock policy uses the formula (1+L) * mean + z * sigma * sqrt(1+L), I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the stable demand regime observed since Period 1. This should allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining a safety stock buffer based on the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1148.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a slight downward trend over the last few periods (Periods 11-15: 114, 90, 111, 95, 64), with Period 15 being notably low. The average demand over these 5 periods is 94.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 95% (19/(19+1)). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent volatility and the slight cooling of demand while maintaining enough stock (on-hand is currently 68) to meet the next period's needs. The L parameter remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with a mean demand of approximately 98.3 units over the last 16 periods. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 12-16), the demand has been: 90, 111, 95, 64, 92 (Mean = 90.4). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Since L=0, we need to ensure our order + on-hand inventory covers the demand of the current period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 36. To avoid stockouts like in Period 5, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly lower recent demand while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter remains at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $621.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant drop, specifically in Period 17 where demand was only 37 compared to a historical average around 100. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand values were 111, 95, 64, 92, and 37. The average across these 5 periods is approximately 79.8, while the average of the last 3 periods is 64.3. Given the sharp decline in Period 17, using a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat will help the OR engine react to this downward trend while still maintaining a reasonable buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all previous arrival data. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the increased volatility observed in the recent data swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1711.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with an average around 95-100 units, although there were lower demand periods recently (P15: 64, P17: 37). The current mean demand across the 18 completed periods is 95.1. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout history, confirming the promised lead time holds. Since there's no strong evidence of a major sustained regime shift or seasonality (beyond common variability in snacks), I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate parameters to stay responsive to the slight downward trend in the last few periods while maintaining a buffer for the typical demand range (80-120). Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a significant drop over the last three periods (P17: 37, P18: 92, P19: 5), with the most recent observation being exceptionally low. Over the first 16 periods, demand averaged approximately 98 units, but the average of the last 3 periods (P17-P19) has fallen to 44.6. This suggests a potential regime shift or a temporary seasonal lull. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system should target a high service level, but we must react to the recent downward demand trend to avoid excessive holding costs on a low-demand baseline. I am choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the downward trend while maintaining enough history to avoid overreacting to the single outlier of 5 units. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting Period 17: Avg demand decreased from ~98 (P1-16) to ~45 (P17-19), with an outlier low of 5 in Period 19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. The previous average (P1-16) was approximately 98 units, but the last four periods (P17-20) show demand of 37, 92, 5, and 40, averaging roughly 43.5 units. Period 19 was a severe outlier (5 units), but even including Period 18's spike, the overall trend is downward. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=4 allows the backend to weigh the recent lower values appropriately while still acknowledging the volatility (sigma) introduced by the fluctuation between 5 and 92.

Daily Reward (R_t): $637.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 17, as previously noted. Recent demand values are 37, 92 (outlier), 5 (outlier), 40, and 37. Excluding the high outlier in P18 and the extreme low in P19, the average demand in this new regime is approximately 38 units. For Period 22, the starting on-hand inventory is 66 units with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 0 (promised). To capture the current lower demand level and avoid over-ordering due to historical high-demand data (P1-16), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (P17-P21). This covers the entire period of the detected regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the increased volatility (37 vs 92 vs 5) observed in this recent window, allowing the OR backend to maintain a sufficient safety stock for the current environment.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. The previous average (P1-16) was ~100 units/period, but since Period 17, the demand has dropped to an average of ~43 units/period (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45). Period 18 looks like a brief rebound/outlier, and Period 19 was an exceptionally low outlier (5). The most recent three periods (P20-22) show a stable lower demand around 40 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the new regime, I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the periods since the shift to avoid over-ordering based on the higher historical average. With on-hand at 49 and demand averaging 40-45, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the base stock level for the current low-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 1 to 16, the average demand was approximately 98 units. Starting at Period 17, demand dropped significantly. The most recent seven periods (P17-P23) show a mean demand of approximately 44 units (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13). Although Period 18 was an outlier (92), the general trend remains low, including very low demand in Period 19 (5) and Period 23 (13). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. With an on-hand inventory of 76 units and recent average demand around 44, current stock covers nearly two periods of demand. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the updated lower demand regime, preventing excessive overstocking while accommodating the observed volatility (sigma) of this new phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand decreased from ~98 to ~44 (based on P17-P23), characterized by higher volatility and frequent low-demand periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. Previous average demand was approximately 98 units, whereas the average since Period 17 (8 periods) has dropped to approximately 39.1 units (consisting of values 37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13, 44). The high volatility (std dev ~26.4 in this new regime) and the presence of extreme lows (e.g., 5 and 13) necessitate a more responsive but cautious forecasting approach. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with observed behavior. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand, high-variance regime, ensuring the inventory levels are sufficient for the lower average while accounting for the high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, there was a major demand spike of 189 units, which significantly exceeds the post-Period 17 average of ~44 and even the pre-Period 17 average of ~98. This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given this sudden jump, I need to determine if this is a new regime or a one-time outlier. Period 25 demand (189) is very high, but looking at history, Period 5 (demand 140) and Period 8 (demand 126) also showed relative spikes. However, the 'Carry-over insights' from Period 24 indicated a lower, more volatile regime. The stockout at Period 25 suggests that the 'recent_N' approach used previously might have under-estimated current needs if demand is recovering or trending upwards. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to include the recent low-history but weight it with the current spike, while setting L=0 as historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger N of 15 to capture the volatility seen both in the low-demand phase and this recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in Period 25 (189 units) follows a low-demand regime (Avg ~44), indicating a potential regime shift or high-amplitude volatility return.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and potential regime shifting. After a prolonged low-demand period (Avg ~41 units from P17-P24), Period 25 saw a massive spike to 189 units, while Period 26 returned to 39 units. This suggests the high-demand period (Avg ~100 units from P1-P16) might be returning, or we are experiencing extreme intermittent shocks. The 'Period 25' spike caused a stockout, and although 134 units arrived in Period 26, the high volatility requires a balanced mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid both stockouts and excessive holding costs. Observed lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to blend the low-regime and the recent spike, and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation observed across these varying regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. After a significant spike in Period 25 (189 units), demand dropped back significantly in Periods 26 (39) and 27 (16). This suggests the Period 25 spike was a transient outlier rather than a sustained regime shift back to high demand. Current on-hand inventory is 129 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer in case the volatility continues, I am using a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 23-27), which averages ~60.2 units per period. This window captures the spike and the subsequent drop, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the current high-volatility environment without overreacting to the single large outlier. Predicted lead time remains 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand volatility remains extremely high. Period 25 spike (189) was followed by very low demand (39 and 16), suggesting spikes are transient but unpredictable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3439.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting around Period 25. We have seen alternating extremes: a spike of 189 (P25), followed by lows of 39 and 16 (P26-27), and then another massive spike of 199 (P28). This suggests that the 'low demand regime' identified in Period 17 (avg ~44) has evolved into a high-variance environment. I am currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0). The OR backend's service level logic (profit $19 vs holding $1) will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Given the binary nature of recent demand (either very low or very high), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture both the low-demand phase (P17-24) and the recent volatility (P25-28). This balances the need to cover the potential for another ~200 unit spike while not over-ordering based solely on the last extreme value. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from a low-stable regime (Avg ~44, P17-24) to an extremely high-volatility regime starting Period 25, characterized by alternating spikes near 200 and dips below 40.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile phase since Period 25. Prior to that, a low-demand regime existed (Avg ~44). In the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has been 189, 39, 16, 199, and 136. This indicates high-amplitude swings. The current on-hand inventory is 34. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the base stock level within the same period. The most recent regime (N=5) captures the current high-volatility state better than the long-term history. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to cover potential spikes (like the 199 seen in Period 28) while reacting to the recent average of ~116.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime confirmed (P25-P29): Demand now fluctuates between extreme lows (<20) and extreme highs (~200), with a recent 5-period average of 115.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. Demand has fluctuated wildly between extreme highs (~200) and extreme lows (<20). Specifically, the last six periods (P25-P30) saw demands of 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, and 13. The average demand of this 6-period regime is 98.7, which is ironically close to the long-term historical mean of ~100, but with a drastically higher standard deviation. This volatility makes inventory management difficult. Currently, on-hand inventory is 242 units (due to a large order placed in Period 30 arriving just as demand crashed to 13). With current on-hand inventory (242) significantly exceeding the expected single-period demand (avg 98.7) and the cap mechanism usually limiting orders, the OR engine will likely order 0 units this period. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime while maintaining a realistic average across the spikes and dips. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2198.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 25, with extreme fluctuations between very low demand (13, 16) and very high demand (189, 199). Current Period 31 demand was 122, which is moderate compared to the extremes but significantly higher than the previous period's 13. Given this unpredictability, I am using a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this volatile regime (Periods 25-31). The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 120 units, providing a buffer against the next potential spike while I set parameters to allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level reflecting the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime continues (P25-P31): Demand fluctuates between extreme lows (<20) and highs (~200), with a 7-period average of 102.0 and high standard deviation.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a high-volatility regime that started at Period 25. Demand in this phase (P25-P32) has been: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122, 55. This results in a mean of 96.1 and a high standard deviation. The most recent three periods (13, 122, 55) average 63.3, but given the frequent spikes near 200, we must maintain a higher base stock to avoid stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 178 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will keep N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of this volatile regime, which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the extreme lows and the potential for a ~200 unit spike. Choosing N=8 covers the transition from P25 onwards.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 25, characterized by extreme swings between very high (~190-200) and very low (<20) demand. Recent demand in Period 33 was 17, and the 9-period average since this volatility began (P25-P33) is approximately 87.3 units with a high standard deviation. Current on-hand inventory is 204 units, which is quite high relative to the average demand. I will use a 9-period window (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime while balancing the recent low demand against previous spikes. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that can absorb potential spikes without over-ordering during troughs, especially given the high on-hand balance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which began around Period 25. Recent demand figures (P30-P34: 13, 122, 55, 17, 56) show a pattern of unpredictable swings, though the peak spikes of ~200 seen earlier have not recurred in the last four periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 84.3 units, but the high variance (standard deviation ~66) makes a static forecast risky. Given the current high inventory (On-hand: 156) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is protecting against the next potential spike while slowly reducing the surplus inventory. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this high-volatility regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, as it spans the entire volatile period since P25. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme volatility regime (starting P25) persists; while recent 4 periods did not exceed 122 units, the standard deviation remains high (~66) compared to early periods, necessitating higher safety stock levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which began around Period 25. Recent demand figures (P31-P35: 122, 55, 17, 56, 16) show a lower average (~53) than the initial spike phase, but the underlying distribution remains unpredictable with a high standard deviation. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently high at 187 units due to a very low demand of 16 in Period 35. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met, I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=11 (P25-P35) to capture the full scope of this high-volatility regime (average ~65, but with significant spikes over 100). This ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased risk of stockouts during spikes while recognizing the current downward trend in the mean compared to the initial transition phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25. Period 36 experienced a sharp demand spike of 187 units, following several periods of lower demand (17, 56, 16). This reinforces the pattern of unpredictable spikes interspersed with low-demand troughs. Currently, on-hand inventory is depleted to 8 units. Because promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals confirm L=0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 (covering the high-volatility regime from Period 25 to Period 36). This ensures the OR backend recognizes the high mean (~75) and high standard deviation required to buffer against these ~200-unit spikes while the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: High-volatility regime (P25-P36) persists; demand spikes to ~190 units (as seen in P36) occur frequently after low-demand periods, requiring a sustained high sigma_hat budget.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme volatility regime that began in Period 25. Recent demand reflects this instability (P36: 187, P37: 111), oscillating between very high spikes and significant drops. The strategy remains focused on capturing these spikes to avoid stockouts, as the profit margin ($19) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1). I will use a recent window (N=13, covering the start of the volatility regime at P25 through P37) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the current high variance and elevated mean compared to the preceding low-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3372.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P25-P38) confirms a high-volatility regime with demand ranging from 13 to 199 units. Within the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has been 16, 187, 111, and 179, showing a significant upward shift in the mean compared to the previous low-demand regime. The 14-period average since the start of this volatile phase (P25) is approximately 102.5 units, but the most recent 4-period average is 123.3 units. Given the extreme peaks (187, 179 recently), I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the full scope of this volatility for mu_hat while setting sigma_hat to a high explicit value to prevent stockouts during these unpredictable spikes. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: High-volatility regime continues with increased frequency of clusters of high demand (>170 units) in the last 3 periods (P36, P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in an extreme volatility regime that began around Period 25. The last few periods (P36-P39) have shown a significant cluster of high demand (187, 111, 179, 197), averaging approximately 168.5 units. This is a noticeable shift from the previous broader extreme volatility which included very low values (<20). To capture this recent sustained high-demand cluster while accounting for the high reward of satisfying demand ($19.0) versus the cost of holding ($1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this current peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: High-demand cluster confirmed (P36-P39): Average demand has stabilized at a higher level (~168.5) within the volatility regime, compared to the previous 115.8 average. High sigma_hat remains necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1267.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a cluster of high demand (P36: 187, P38: 179, P39: 197), Period 40 saw a decrease to 75 units. However, the overall average since the transition at Period 25 is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime, and the volatility (sigma) is substantial. The recent five-period average (P36-P40) is 129.8, while the average since Period 25 is 101.9. Given the persistent high-amplitude fluctuations where demand frequently spikes toward 200, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=16 (covering the regime from P25 onwards) to capture the higher mean and return sigma_hat to the default (all-period) calculation to provide a robust safety buffer against the extreme spikes observed. Lead time remains consistently at 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme high-amplitude volatility, which transitioned around Period 25. Recent demand has fluctuated between extreme lows (8 units in P41) and highs (197 units in P39). The Carry-over Insights highlight a high-demand cluster (P36-P39) with an average of ~168.5, but the drop to 75 (P40) and 8 (P41) suggests the volatility regime is the primary characteristic rather than a stable high-demand shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage this, I am using a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the current high-volatility regime (P36-P41), as this period includes both the recent spike cluster and the subsequent sharp drops. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the high mean and the significant standard deviation, providing a safety buffer for potential spikes while clearing excess inventory during low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility, a pattern established since Period 25. Recent demand in Periods 41 and 42 dropped significantly (8 and 19 units) following a moderate-to-high demand phase (P36-P40, avg ~130). This cycling between extreme highs (~200) and extreme lows (<20) is consistent with the current regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 231 units, which is higher than the historical maximum demand spike (~199). Given this high buffer, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining protection against the next inevitable spike. I am using recent_N (N=18, covering the high-volatility regime starting Period 25) for demand and sigma estimation to capture this bimodal behavior. The OR backend will see the high inventory and likely calculate a small or zero order, which is appropriate given the current surplus and recent low demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 25, characterized by wild swings between extreme lows (<10) and extreme highs (~200). Recent demand includes a spike of 192 units in Period 43, following very low values (8, 19). The 7-period average (P37-P43) is 125.8, while the standard deviation remains extremely high (~80) due to this bimodal behavior. The 'High-demand cluster' noted in Period 40 seems more like a continuation of this high-volatility regime rather than a stable shift to a higher mean. To protect against the ~200 unit spikes while managing holding costs, I will use a recent N approach (N=19, covering the high-volatility regime since Period 25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current extreme variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-201.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which became the dominant regime at Period 25. Recent demand reflects this: Period 43 saw a massive spike to 192 units, followed immediately by a near-zero demand of 1 in Period 44. Since Period 40, the average demand is approximately 74 units, but the high-frequency spikes (like P43) necessitate a safety stock buffer to prevent stockouts during peak demand. The current on-hand inventory is 220 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and the demand is highly erratic, I will set mu_hat based on the recent volatility regime (last 20 periods) to capture the high variance and periodic spikes. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to ensure the backend accounts for the extreme standard deviation observed lately, protecting against the next potential spike around 200 units. I am setting L to default (0) as all recent orders have arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Extreme high-low demand oscillation continues (P43: 192, P44: 1). This confirms the high-volatility regime remains active with spikes still reaching ~200 units followed by periods of dormancy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2760.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme high-low oscillation characteristic of the 'volatility regime' identified since Period 25. Recent demand observations (P43: 192, P44: 1, P45: 149) confirm that demand can swing from near-zero to nearly 200 units within a single period. The current on-hand inventory is 71 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the inventory policy should strongly favor higher service levels to avoid lost sales during the frequent ~200 unit spikes. I am choosing recent_N = 21 (covering Period 25 to 45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the full breadth of this extreme volatility regime, while maintaining L=0 as actual lead times remain consistent with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2961.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme high-low oscillation characteristic of the volatility regime starting at Period 25. Recent demand reflects this: P43 (192), P44 (1), P45 (149), and P46 (159). These spikes towards the ~200 unit ceiling occur frequently enough that the inventory must be prepared for back-to-back high-demand periods. Although the most recent two periods (P45-46) were both high, the 'dormancy' periods observed previously (e.g., P41-42, P44) suggest the volatility remains the primary challenge. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P37-P46) to capture the current high-volatility cluster, which encompasses several spikes near 200 and several deep lows. This N=10 window provides a balanced mu_hat and sigma_hat that accounts for the high amplitude of demand shifts while preventing over-reaction to single-period lows or highs. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand continues to exhibit extreme volatility, oscillating between near-zero (Period 44: 1) and near-200 (Period 43: 192), with recent periods showing a cluster of higher demand (P45-47 avg: 156.7). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since we are entering the final periods of the game (P48 of 50), the strategy must focus on maintaining enough stock to cover these ~200 unit spikes while minimizing leftover holding costs in P50. I will use the recent_N method with N=12 to capture the high-volatility regime that stabilized around Period 36, which covers both the high spikes and the dormant periods. This provides a balanced mu_hat and a high sigma_hat to protect against the frequent spikes without over-ordering excessively at the very end.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the final period (Period 49/50). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in an extremely high-volatility regime that started around Period 25. Recent demand has shown a mix of high spikes (149, 159, 162 in P45-47) followed by a sharp drop to 59 in Period 48. On-hand inventory is currently high at 185 units. Since this is the penultimate decision and the promised lead time is 0 (confirmed by history to be consistently 0), any order placed now will arrive and be sold within this same period. Given the service level target (95% based on profit/cost), we need to ensure the base stock covers potential spikes up to ~200 units. A recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=9 captures the average of the most recent high-volatility cluster (P40-P48 average ~105), while a recent_N sigma_hat with N=15 captures the high volatility characteristic of this era. This balances the risk of stockouts against unnecessary holding costs for the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2666.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility (spiking to ~200 or dropping near 0) within the high-volatility regime that began in Period 25. Recent demand in Period 49 was 144, following 59 in Period 48. The last five periods (P45-P49) averaged 123.6 units, while the current period's on-hand inventory is 70. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is critical to capture the frequent spikes (e.g., P46: 159, P47: 162). I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher mean and variance seen in the recent clusters, ensuring base stock levels are sufficient to cover potential spikes up to 200 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect this persistent extreme volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: High-volatility regime (P25-P49) shows persistent bimodal demand; recent 10-period average is 101.4, but standard deviation is very high (~73), requiring aggressive safety stock for frequent spikes >150.
