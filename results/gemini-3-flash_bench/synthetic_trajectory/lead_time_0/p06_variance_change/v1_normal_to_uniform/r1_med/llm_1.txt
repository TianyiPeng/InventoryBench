Looking at the provided historical demand for 5 periods, the average is approximately 98 units (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). Demand appears to fluctuate but remains significant. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period. Since current On-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately, I will place an order based on the historical average plus a small buffer to account for variance.

The historical samples show a wide range (60-122), but recent realized demand (118, 155) suggests the current demand regime is trending towards the higher end of the historical ceiling or possibly exceeding it. To prevent a third consecutive stockout and maximize reward, I need to cover the current period's demand (L=0, so D_t).

While this might be a one-time anomaly or a downward shift, the current on-hand inventory is 93. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by the P1-P7 history), I only need to order enough to meet Period 8 demand. Given the recent drop in demand, buying too much would incur a high holding cost ($1/unit). I will estimate Period 8 demand at roughly 100 units (mean of recent periods) to be safe, but since I already have 93 units on hand, I will order enough to bring total inventory to 110.
