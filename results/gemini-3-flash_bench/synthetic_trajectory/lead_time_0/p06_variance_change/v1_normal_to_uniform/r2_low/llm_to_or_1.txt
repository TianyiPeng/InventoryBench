Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. High holding cost relative to profit suggests a conservative inventory strategy (service level of 0.50). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. There is a visible drop in demand starting around Period 3. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent mean (98.2) while acknowledging the high volatility across these samples. L is set to default (0).

=== Period 1 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=99, arrived=99 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=99, demand=121, sold=99, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $99.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 99 units based on initial logic. According to the 'Period 1 conclude' message, the lead time was 0 periods, meaning the goods arrived within the same period. Demand was 121, but we only had 99 units on-hand, resulting in a stockout (sold 99, lost 22 potential sales). The inventory is now 0. Historical demand samples (P1: 122, P2: 121, P3: 60, P4: 83, P5: 105) suggest a high-demand regime at the start that drops significantly. However, Period 1 realized demand was 121, which matches the 'Period_2' sample in the provided historical list. It appears the 'samples' provided in the prompt are sequential. Period 1 demand was ~121/122. If we follow the sample sequence, Period 2 demand is expected to be ~121, but it might drop to ~60 (Period 3 sample) soon. Given the 0 lead time and high holding cost relative to profit ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost), the OR backend's target service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.50) will naturally aim for the median. To prevent further stockouts while staying lean, I will use recent demand history to set parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile start: P1=122 (implied by sold 99 and ending 0, plus previous user context), P2=121 (implied), and P3 history context says 122, 121, 60. Comparing the 'conclude' messages: Period 1 demand was actually 121 (sold 99, 22 lost) and Period 2 demand was 87. The product is chips, and we are at Period 3. Observed lead time is 0 (arrivals happen same period). mu_hat should reflect the recent trend; demand dropped from ~121 to 87. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this immediate shift while calculating the base stock. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=2 to reflect the recent variability. Since L=0, (1+L)=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': The promised lead time (L) is 0. Looking at the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3, orders are consistently arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0), confirming actual L = 0. Demand for the first three periods was 121, 87, and 96 respectively (Mean: 101.3). The current on-hand inventory is 8. Since demand occurs after our decision and lead time is 0, the total pipeline inventory (on-hand + current order) needs to cover Period 4 demand. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) shows higher variance and suggests we are in a regime where demand averages around 100 but has dipped recently. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. L remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods has been [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], though the realized demand reported in the 'conclude' messages differs slightly ([121, 87, 96, 86]), likely due to the system resolving demand after arrivals. The mean demand across available samples is approximately 98.2. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 16 units on-hand with nothing in transit. Given the Profit of $1.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (z* = 0). This means the base stock should aim for the median/mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution, as no specific seasonal trend is yet evident from the date-agnostic period markers.

=== Period 5 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $99.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 98.2 units, but Period 5 saw a significant spike to 140 (compared to the previous average of ~88-121). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand. However, the last period (P5) resulted in a stockout (demand 140, sold 99, 0 ending inventory). The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrival data confirms actual lead time is 0. I will prioritize recent demand patterns to capture the recent spike while maintaining a moderate buffer. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen between Periods 1-5 (range 86 to 140).

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 23 units with 0 units in-transit. Based on historical data from Period 1 to Period 6, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the last 6 periods has shown some volatility: Period 1 (121), Period 2 (87), Period 3 (96), Period 4 (86), Period 5 (140 - though only 99 were sold due to stockout), and Period 6 (83). The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 102.17 units. Considering the stockout in Period 5 when demand spiked to 140, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend while allowing for sufficient safety stock. With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but the backend's base_stock calculation and capping logic will manage the trade-off. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all 6 concluded periods provides a stable and responsive estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (Periods 1-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0 consistently. Demand has shown some variability but remains within a relatively stable range. The mean demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 98.6 (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77). Period 5 saw a jump to 140, but the last two periods have been lower (83 and 77), suggesting a possible downward shift or just high variance. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should essentially target the median/mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 94 units/period) while being responsive to the recent lower demand observations. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 8 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean of ~102 units (Historical + Game History averages: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 from samples; 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126 from game). Period 5 and Period 8 saw stockouts despite deliveries arriving same-period, suggesting we need to capture slightly more demand coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full game history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand patterns while using the 'calculate' method for L to affirm the 0-period lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock sufficient to handle the recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown two distinct regimes. Initial samples (Period 1-5) averaged 98.2 units, while the most recent five periods (Period 5-9) average 104.6 units. The product description is generic, suggesting relatively stable demand, but the presence of stockouts in Periods 1, 5, and 8 indicates the base stock is occasionally insufficient to cover spikes. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the recent 5 samples (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the slightly higher recent demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a safety stock that buffers against 120+ demand peaks while accounting for the same-day arrival logic (L=0).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods has been relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 99.5 units and a standard deviation of about 18.9. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 10 arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0). There is no distinct seasonal shift or regime change visible in the data yet. Since the profit per unit and holding cost per unit are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.5. To maintain responsiveness to the recent variation while utilizing the full history's stability, I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a consistent pattern around a mean of approximately 101 units per period (Periods 1-11 mean = 101.8). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met in every period so far. Inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (114) exceeded starting inventory (102). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent history of this stable regime. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as it is reliable. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated from the last 11 samples to ensure the most relevant statistical profile is used for the next order.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1. The average demand across all periods is approximately 98 units, with recent periods (P8-P12) averaging 105.8. Lead time is consistently 0 (ordered and arrived in the same period). Specifically, P12 demand was 90, and P13 starts with an inventory of 13. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods to capture current demand intensity (avg ~101) while smoothing out noise. The lead time L is set to 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has shown a remarkably consistent demand pattern through the first 13 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-13) is approximately 102.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 17.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period to meet customer demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the demand is stable and hasn't shown significant shifts or seasonality in this short window, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the most representative recent behavior (Period 4 onwards), which avoids any early initialization noise if it existed. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the OR engine will target a service level (q) of 0.5 (z=0), effectively aiming to stock the mean demand. My parameters (L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*mean, sigma_hat = (1+0)*std) will instruct the OR engine to order approximately the mean demand each period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with an observed mean of approximately 100.2 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods in every case (arrived same period). The most recent 5-period demand average is 102.4. I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat to capture recent demand levels more accurately than the full 14-period average, while using default for sigma_hat as volatility has been fairly consistent. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand pace (targeting ~102 units plus safety stock) while recognizing the 0-period lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the past 15 periods, with a cumulative mean of approximately 99.27. No seasonal patterns or date-related drivers are identifiable as the periods are generic. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods (all orders P1-P15 arrived the same period). Based on a service level target (q) of 0.5 (Profit $1, Holding $1), I will use the established historical mean and standard deviation to ensure 'base_stock' reflects the median demand. I'll use a recent window (N=10) for demand and standard deviation to capture the most relevant variance while smoothing out the lower demand observed in Period 15 (64).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (last 5 periods: 140, 83, 77, 126, 97, 102, 114, 90, 111, 95, 64, 92) shows a shift from the initial pre-game samples (avg ~98). The mean demand over the 16 observed periods is approximately 98.8, which is higher than the initial samples. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 93) while maintaining stability. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to assume. With both profit and holding cost at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we want to target the median demand (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat) to avoid high holding costs while maintaining decent service. On-hand is currently 4, and there is no in-transit inventory, so the system needs to order enough to cover Period 17's demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a noticeable decline. Over the first 14 periods, the average demand was approximately 101.4 units. However, in the last three periods (P15-P17), demand dropped significantly to 64, 92, and 37 respectively (averaging 64.3). While P16 was closer to the norm, the overall trend suggests a shift or high volatility. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0 each), the OR engine's critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. This means the target base stock will be the median demand (z*=0). To avoid overstocking during this apparent downturn while still maintaining service, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture the cooling demand more quickly than a full-history average. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period from P1 to P17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started Period 15: avg demand dropped from ~101 to ~64 over the last 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 18 and noted in Carry-over Insights is confirmed with the arrival of Period 18 data. Recent demand (P15-P18) has averaged 71.25 units, significantly lower than the historical average of approximately 101 units. Period 18 demand spiked back to 92, but the previous three periods (64, 92, 37) show high volatility and a downward trend from the earlier stable regime. With zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit, I need to restock. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the shift and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-62.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has become highly volatile and recently dropped significantly. The last five demand figures are 64, 92, 37, 92, and 5. The average demand in this five-period window is 58, compared to the overall historical average of approximately 94. Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with ordering the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to respond to this lower, more volatile regime. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded period so far. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this increased forecast uncertainty within the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 15-19 average demand decreased to 58 (from ~100), with increased volatility (standard deviation > 30).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower and more volatile regime since Period 15. Previous periods (P15-P20) show demand values of 64, 92, 37, 92, 5, and 40. The average demand during this window is approximately 55, which is a significant drop from the ~100 average observed in the first 14 periods. The carry-over insights correctly identified this shift. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (0.5 quantile). With the recent volatility (standard deviation ~35) and lower mean, I will use a recent window of N=6 (Period 15-20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new regime while ignoring the older high-demand data. The on-hand inventory is 27, and there are no units in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 15. Prior to Period 15, the average demand was approximately 101 units. In the most recent 7 periods (P15-P21), the average demand has dropped to approximately 52 units (64, 92, 37, 92, 5, 40, 37), with high volatility including a very low outlier of 5 in Period 19. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. Given the lower and more volatile demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a window of the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this new regime while providing enough samples to account for the increased variance. With profit=1 and holding=1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand; however, the OR backend's natural safety stock calculation will help buffer the high variance observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 15. Analysis of the most recent 8 periods (P15-P22) shows a significantly lower mean demand of 51.5 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~28.5). Although Period 20 shows 'ordered=0, arrived=0', all other recent orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, suggesting the lead time remains stable at 0. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while accounting for the recent high volatility. Setting L to 'default' matches the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15. The initial mean (Periods 1-14) was ~101, but the average since Period 15 has dropped to ~47. Recent volatility is extremely high, with demand fluctuating between 5 and 92 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P20-P23) had demands of 40, 37, 45, and 13 (avg ~34). Given the current on-hand inventory of 39 units and a lead time of 0 periods, I need to set parameters that recognize this lower average while protecting against the high variance seen in P16-P18. I am using recent_N (N=9, covering P15-P23) to capture this new, volatile regime. This balances the risk of overstocking with the high holding cost ($1) and the need to meet potential spikes in this unstable phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 15: Average demand decreased from ~100 to ~47 (down ~53%), with significantly higher volatility and demand swings ranging from 5 to 92 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 15. Analysis of the period 15-24 interval shows an average demand of 47 units (down from ~100 in the first 14 periods) with high volatility (swinging from 5 to 92). The last 5 periods (P20-P24) have an average demand of 35.8, suggesting a continued low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 24 concluded with 4 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I will set OR parameters to cover the new lower demand regime using the last 10 periods (N=10) to balance the high volatility against the lower mean. This N=10 window captures the entirety of the low-demand regime starting at P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, there was a massive demand spike to 189 units, which is significantly higher than the average demand of ~47 observed in the recent regime (Periods 15-24). This spike resulted in 0 ending on-hand inventory. Historically (Periods 1-14), demand averaged around 100 before dropping. The spike in Period 25 (189) suggests either a temporary anomaly or a new high-demand regime, possibly linked to a calendar event or promotion. Given the SKU is 'chips(Regular)' and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (implying a target service level of 0.5), the OR backend's default logic would typically aim for the median. However, to recover from the stockout and account for significant recent volatility (Standard Deviation is very high due to the 189 spike), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the shift from Period 15 to 25) to capture both the lower regime and the recent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 25: 189 units (300% increase over previous 10-period average). Monitoring for sustained higher demand level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, a significant demand spike of 189 units occurred, which was roughly 4 times the average of the low-demand regime seen since Period 15. However, Period 26 demand returned to 39 units, suggesting the spike was a transient outlier rather than a sustained shift back to high demand levels. The 'low-demand regime' (Periods 15-26, excluding the outlier) has an average of approximately 46. The actual lead time remains 0 based on history. Given the high volatility (sigma) introduced by the Period 25 outlier, I will use a larger N for mu_hat to stabilize the forecast while using a smaller N for sigma_hat to capture the recent dispersion caused by the spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without over-reacting to a single event.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand spike in P25 (189 units) appears transient; P26 demand (39 units) returned to the low-demand regime level (~47 avg).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 15, dropping from a historical average of ~100 to a lower, more volatile regime. While a significant demand spike of 189 units occurred in Period 25, it appears to have been transient, as demand in Periods 26 (39 units) and 27 (16 units) returned to the lower-regime levels observed since Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 27 (excluding the Period 25 spike) is approximately 47.7 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. To minimize holding costs while protecting against the high volatility seen in this lower regime, I am using a recent window (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This window captures the behavior of the current regime since Period 15, including the P25 spike, which correctly adjusts the safety stock upward via sigma_hat to account for such outliers without overestimating the sustained mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, there was a significant demand spike of 199 units, mirroring the spike seen in Period 25 (189 units). This suggests the 'low-demand' regime identified since Period 15 (average ~47) is periodically interrupted by massive spikes. Over the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is ~66 units with a high standard deviation. Because the spikes are becoming more frequent (every 3 periods: P25 and P28), I must adjust the forecast upward to capture this potential volatility. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to incorporate both the low-demand periods and the two recent spikes into the mean and variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a higher base stock to cover these periodic surges without over-stocking excessively for the low periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes detected (P25: 189, P28: 199). Demand is no longer a steady low regime but a mix of low base (~40) and high spikes (~190) occurring approximately every 3 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has transitioned from a steady low regime (~47 units) into a highly volatile state with extreme spikes occurring every 3-4 periods (P25: 189, P28: 199, P29: 136). The average lead time remains 0. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. However, the recent volatility (standard deviation > 70) and stockouts in P25, P28, and P29 necessitate a higher mu_hat to ensure product availability for these spikes while avoiding excessive overstocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this 'high-spike' volatility (P24-P29), which includes three spikes and three low periods. This averages out to a mu_hat reflecting the increased demand intensity. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 85 to account for the extreme range (16 to 199) observed in this recent window.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes confirmed: High demand clusters observed between P25-P29 (189, 199, 136) interspersed with low periods (39, 16). Demand is no longer a simple low-regime base.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from a consistent regime to a highly volatile pattern characterized by periodic extreme spikes (approx. 136-199 units) and very low base periods (13-44 units). Specifically, spikes occurred at P25, P28, and P29. While P30 saw a significant drop (demand=13), the average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 99 units, compared to the previous low-regime average of ~47. Given the high stockout risk from these spikes and the equal weight of profit and holding costs ($1 each), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this new high-variance 'spiky' regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted significantly since P25: demand now alternates between extreme spikes (136-199) and low troughs (13-44), creating a bimodal distribution with a 6-period mean of ~99.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a stable regime (~100 units/period) to a bimodal distribution starting around Period 25. We now observe periodic extreme spikes (189, 199, 136, 122) followed by very low troughs (13, 16, 39). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) is approximately 102 units, but the volatility is extremely high (\u03c3 \u2248 75). Because the most recent demand (P31) was a spike (122), and historical patterns suggest spikes often cluster or occur every 1-3 periods, I need to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts during these volatile bursts. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility bimodal regime starting at P25, ensuring the backend OR engine accounts for the increased standard deviation while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand regime confirmed since P25: Demand alternates between extreme spikes (122-199) and troughs (13-44). 7-period average is ~102 with standard deviation ~75.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is bimodal, characterized by extreme spikes (136-199) and significant troughs (13-55). The average demand over these last 8 periods is approximately 96.1, but the volatility is extremely high (\u03c3 \u2248 75). Because the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver for the base stock. Using the last 8 periods (N=8) captures this bimodal behavior while excluding the previous low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The strategy is to set a base stock that covers the average of this high-volatility regime to balance the risk of running out during spikes against high holding costs during troughs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, bimodal regime since Period 25. Demand alternates between extreme peaks (122-199) and deep troughs (13-55). Recent periods (P30-P33) show demand values of 13, 122, 55, and 17. The current on-hand inventory is 80 units, which is high given the recent trough of 17. However, the moving 9-period average (P25-P33) is approximately 87 with a standard deviation of 69, reflecting the high variance. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, which may be insufficient to capture the intermittent spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this entire bimodal segment (P25-P33), ensuring the OR backend considers both the low troughs and the high spikes when calculating the base stock. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, bimodal regime since Period 25, characterized by extreme spikes (up to 199) and significant troughs (as low as 13). The 10-period mean (P25-P34) is approximately 84.0 units with a high standard deviation (approx 68), reflecting this instability. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To handle the bimodal nature and prevent stockouts during the frequent spikes (P25, P28, P29, P31), I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for both mean and volatility to capture this specific regime. This keeps the base stock high enough to buffer against the spikes while recognizing the increased holding cost risks associated with the trough periods.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand regime (P25-P34) confirms mean demand of ~84 units with high volatility (\u03c3 ~68). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal distribution with high-intensity spikes (up to ~200) followed by periods of low activity (sub-20). The regime shift that started around Period 25 has stabilized into this high-volatility pattern. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. For Period 36, on-hand inventory is 69 units. Given the bimodal nature, calculating demand over the entire bimodal window (P25-P35) provides the most robust estimate for the base-stock levels. The average demand during this window (N=11) is approximately 78 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 71 units. Using recent_N with N=11 will allow the OR engine to capture this high-variance state, ensuring the base-stock level is sufficient to handle potential upcoming spikes while accounting for the current on-hand stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal distribution starting from Period 25, characterized by extreme spikes (approx. 120-200 units) and low troughs (approx. 13-56 units). Period 36 experienced another major spike of 187 units, which completely depleted the inventory. The Lead Time is consistently 0. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock equal to the mean demand. However, because the demand is bimodal rather than normal, using a standard mean might lead to frequent stockouts during spikes. For Period 37, I will use the established bimodal regime (P25-P36) to calculate parameters. The mean demand for these 12 periods is approximately 88.5 units with a standard deviation of 69.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this specific regime's behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L=0.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand regime (P25-P36) remains active: mean demand ~89, standard deviation ~69. Spikes occur roughly every 3-4 periods (P25, P28, P29, P31, P36).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a bimodal regime since Period 25, characterized by extreme spikes (111-199 range) and significant troughs (13-56 range). The last two periods (P36: 187, P37: 111) show a cluster of high demand, suggesting we are currently in or just exiting a 'spike' phase. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, but given the high cost of stockouts during spikes, the base stock policy must account for the high variance (\u03c3 \u2248 69). I am using recent_N (N=13, from P25 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this bimodal regime's mean (approx 89) and volatility, as the earlier periods (P1-P24) are no longer representative of the current demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand regime stable since P25: Demand tracks between extreme spikes (>110) and troughs (<60). 13-period mean (P25-P37) is 89.1, standard deviation is 69.1.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal regime characterized by extreme spikes (recent P36: 187, P37: 111, P38: 179) and low troughs (<60). The mean demand since the P25 shift is approximately 89.1 units with a high standard deviation (~69.1). Recent demand (P36-P38) has been consistently high, with three consecutive periods of demand \u2265 111, which is a departure from the previous pattern of 1-period spikes. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand cluster, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the full bimodal regime (P25-P38, N=14). Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat is set to the (1+L) * mean of last 14 samples to capture the average requirements of this high-volatility state, while sigma_hat reflect the high variance (sqrt(1+L) * std) to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover potential continued spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster detected P36-P38: demand averaged 159 over 3 periods, significantly higher than the P25-P35 bimodal average of ~70. This suggests spikes may be clustering or the base mean is shifting upward again.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand cluster. From Period 36 to Period 39, the actual demand values were 187, 111, 179, and 197, results in an average demand of 168.5 units per period. This is significantly higher than the previous bimodal average of ~84 units identified in Period 35. The inventory has been completely depleted (ending on-hand inventory = 0) for the last four consecutive periods (P36-P39), indicating that the current base stock logic is failing to meet this surge. Since L=0, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the immediate period's demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new high-demand regime specifically. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened volatility during this cluster. Lead time L remains at 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster confirmed P36-P39: average demand increased to 168.5 units (from ~84 in the P25-P35 period), resulting in stockouts for 4 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime recently (Period 36-40), with a four-period average demand of 168.5 units. While Period 40 saw a decrease to 75 units, the preceding three periods were extremely high (187, 111, 179, 197). The system is currently in a bimodal or high-spike state where traditional averaging over long periods underestimates requirements, leading to the stockouts seen in Periods 36-39. With on-hand inventory at 94 units and lead time consistently at 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for another ~190 unit spike while acknowledging the recent 75 unit dip. Using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat captures the 150.0 average of this high-activity cluster (187, 111, 179, 197, 75). Sigma_hat using N=5 reflects the extreme volatility (std ~54) of these spikes and troughs, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent further stockouts during this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility cluster P36-P40 confirmed: demand moved from bimodal (avg ~84) to a high-intensity cluster (avg ~150), characterized by frequent spikes near 200 and occasional drops to 75.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-intensity cluster phase since Period 36, characterized by high demand spikes (averaging ~150 units). Although demand in Period 41 was extremely low (8 units), this follows four periods of heavy stockouts and fits the bimodal/volatile pattern established since Period 25. The current on-hand inventory is 142. Given the high volatility and recent spikes near 200, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (Period 36-41) to capture this high-demand regime (average demand ~110, but heavily influenced by recent stockouts limiting observed demand; actual demand mean is closer to 150). I use recent_N with N=6 to cover this cluster. Sigma_hat is set using N=17 (Period 25-41) to capture the full volatility of the bimodal/spike pattern. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high-intensity bimodal cluster (Period 36-41), but Period 41 showed a significant individual trough (8 units), confirming the 'spike and trough' nature continues within the higher mean regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-intensity bimodal pattern that shifted around Period 36. Since P36, demand has fluctuated between massive spikes (~180-200) and significant troughs (8-75, with very low values in the last two periods: 8 and 19). Over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), the average demand is approximately 110.8 with a high standard deviation (approx 83), though the most recent 4 periods (P39-P42) average 74.8 due to the sudden drop in the last two periods. Because of the current high on-hand inventory (123) and the extreme volatility where demand can drop near zero or spike to 200, I will use a recent N (last 7 periods) approach to capture the current high-volatility regime (P36-P42) while acknowledging the recent troughs to avoid excessive overstocking. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in high-volatility bimodal regime (P36-P42): mean ~111, but the last two periods (P41-P42) showed extreme troughs (8 and 19 units), confirming the 'spike and trough' risk remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility, bimodal behavior that shifted into a higher-intensity regime around Period 36. In this recent regime (P36-P43), the average demand is approximately 121 units (with specific values: 187, 111, 179, 197, 75, 8, 19, 192). However, this 'average' is deceptive because of the extreme bimodal distribution: demand clusters either near 180-200 or drops below 20. Period 43 saw a major spike (192), depleting the 123 units on hand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time remains consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the high-end risk of a 200-unit spike while acknowledging the significant volatility. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 (the start of the high-intensity cluster) to capture both the high spikes and the recent extreme troughs. This provides a mu_hat reflective of the current increased demand intensity and a sigma_hat that accounts for the massive swings, ensuring the backend OR policy maintains enough inventory to prevent the stockouts observed between P36-P39.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity bimodal regime (P36-P43) confirmed: mean demand ~121, with frequent spikes (~190) and extreme troughs (<20). Volatility remains the primary driver of stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-119.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-intensity bimodal pattern (Period 36-44) with extreme swings between spikes (~190) and troughs (as low as 1 in P44). This high volatility leads to frequent stockouts when a spike hits but high holding costs when it doesn't. In Period 44, we observed a massive drop to 1 unit of demand after a spike of 192 in Period 43. The 9-period average for this high-intensity regime (P36-P44) is approximately 107.7 units, with a very high standard deviation (~84). Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level factor (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. However, the OR backend's capped policy and the current extreme volatility suggest using a recent window that captures this bimodal behavior. I will use recent_N=9 to cover the entirety of this high-intensity regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the current level of uncertainty while balancing the equal costs of stockouts and holding.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity bimodal regime (P36-P44) shows mean demand of ~108 with extreme volatility (\u03c3 ~84); demand fluctuated from 192 (P43) to 1 (P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to iterate through a high-intensity bimodal regime (Period 36 to present), characterized by extreme swings between spikes (~150-200) and deep troughs (1-19). Period 45 observed a demand of 149, which exhausted the 120 units on hand resulting in a stockout. Because the lead time is 0, the backend's base-stock calculation for Period 46 must account for the immediate demand. Since P36, the demand average has shifted significantly higher than the earlier bimodal period. To capture this high-volatility cluster without being overly influenced by the single extreme trough in P44 (demand=1), I am using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the most relevant high-intensity regime (P36-P45), providing a balanced mean and capturing the high standard deviation (~80) necessary to buffer against the frequent 190+ point spikes. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0.

Since Period 36, the average demand is approximately 117 units with a very high standard deviation (~77). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable. In Period 46, demand was 159, and the order of 112 units was completely sold out, leaving 0 on-hand. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand. However, the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts (evident in P43, P45, P46) suggest that the 'default' or even 'recent_N' stats might undershoot during spike clusters. I will use recent_N with N=11 (covering the high-intensity regime from P36-P46) to capture the current mean and volatility while allowing the OR backend to balance the 50% service level requirement.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in a high-intensity bimodal regime (starting P36) characterized by extreme spikes (130-197) and deep troughs (1-19). The last three periods (P45-P47) showed high demand (149, 159, 162), which have completely depleted on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts. Current on-hand is 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1.0 vs 1.0, implying a 50% target service level in the base-stock model, though the OR engine's cap and logic may vary), we need to ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover the current high-demand cluster while accounting for the extreme volatility. The average demand since P36 is approximately 115 units with a standard deviation of ~75. To capture the recent upward trend in the last few periods and the ongoing bimodal spikes, I am using recent_N (N=12, covering P36-P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced estimate that acknowledges the high mean of the current regime without overreacting to the single low trough (P44=1) or being purely anchored to the spikes.

Carry-over insight: P47: Demand regime P36-P47 remains high-intensity bimodal with an average of ~115 units, but recent demand (P45-P47) suggests a sustained cluster above 150 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-intensity bimodal regime (starting P36) with extreme swings between spikes (~200) and troughs (<20). Recent history (P45-P48) has seen a sequence of high demand (149, 159, 162) followed by a moderate drop to 59 in P48. Given the bimodal nature, there is a high probability of another spike approaching 200 units soon. With lead time L=0, we must ensure on-hand inventory covers the current period's potential spike. The average demand in the high-intensity regime (P36-P48) is approximately 119, but the volatility (sigma) is extremely high (~75-80). I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of this high regime in P36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased mean and volatility. Setting L to default (0) as delivery remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: P49: High-intensity bimodal regime (P36-P48) average demand is 119.3 units with standard deviation of 76.8; recent demand cluster (P45-P47) averaged 156.7 prior to P48's drop to 59.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in a high-intensity bimodal regime that began around Period 36. Recent demand remains highly volatile, alternating between extreme spikes near 200 (P43: 192, P47: 162) and intermittent troughs or moderate periods (P48: 59, P49: 144). Since Period 36, the average demand is approximately 117.4 with a standard deviation of roughly 71.5. In the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), the average shifted higher to 133.6. Given the bimodal nature, a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 (covering the entire high-intensity regime from P36-P49) provides a robust estimate of the mean and volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high risk of stockouts during spikes while recognizing the low periods to prevent excessive holding costs. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity bimodal regime (P36-P49) confirmed: average demand ~117.4, standard deviation ~71.5. Spikes frequently reach the 150-200 range, while troughs can drop below 20.
