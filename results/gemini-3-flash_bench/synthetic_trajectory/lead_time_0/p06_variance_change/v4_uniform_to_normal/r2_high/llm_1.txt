(c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 0. With L=0, an order placed now should arrive in the current period to satisfy demand. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. (e) Final Order Logic: Since I am starting with 0 inventory and need to satisfy Period 1 demand immediately (L=0), I must order enough to cover the expected demand for this period plus a safety buffer.
