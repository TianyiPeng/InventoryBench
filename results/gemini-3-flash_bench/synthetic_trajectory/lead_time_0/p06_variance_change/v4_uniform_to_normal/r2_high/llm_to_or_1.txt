Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data to infer actual lead time shifts or demand changes yet. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the average demand is approximately 112.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 20.3. Since L=0, mu_hat should target a base stock covering (0+1) units of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent data provided in the prompt, and 'default' for L to use the promised Lead Time of 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods (order arrived same-period). Total demand was 63 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples (avg ~112). However, looking at the provided Historical Demand Data (Period 1: 112, Period 2: 111, Period 3: 80, Period 4: 129, Period 5: 130), there is a discrepancy between the 'Game History' (P1 demand = 63) and the 'Historical Demand Data' listed in the prompt (P1-P5). I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' sequence as the likely forecast reference for the upcoming periods, while noting the actual P1 realized demand of 63. Given L=0 and current on-hand of 83, I need to order enough to reach a base stock that covers Period 2 demand. Based on the historical trend (P1:112, P2:111), mean demand is approximately 112. I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture this mean while accounting for the volatility shown in the historical data (range 80-130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1248.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 82 units. Historical data shows demand for Period 1 was 63 and Period 2 was 70. Both orders placed so far (Period 1 and Period 2) arrived in the same period, confirming the lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods as promised. The provided 'Historical Demand Data' shows samples of 112, 111, 80, 129, and 130; however, the actual 'Game History' for the first two periods shows significantly lower realized demand (63 and 70). Given this discrepancy, I will prioritize recent game history to avoid overstocking. Since only two periods have concluded, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with the observed demand trend (average ~66.5). The lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Profit: $1558.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout because demand spiked to 136 units while we only had 82 on-hand (ordered 0). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in P1 and P2 confirm that orders arrive in the same period they are placed. The demand across the first 5 samples is [112, 111, 80, 129, 130] (from 'Historical Demand Data') which averages 112.4 with a standard deviation of 19.34. However, the game history shows actual realized demand in P1-P3 as 63, 70, and 136. There is a clear discrepancy between the pre-game samples and the in-game observations, with P3 showing a significant surge. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to set parameters that ensure the base stock covers at least one full period of high demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the rising trend (avg 89.6) but will lean on the higher historical mean from the 5 samples (112.4) to avoid further stockouts. Given the volatility and the stockout in P3, I'll use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure a healthy safety stock. For L=0, mu_hat should target the upper end of observed demand (~125) and sigma_hat should reflect the recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Analyzing the historical demand provided in the snippets (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) versus the 'conclude' messages (63, 70, 136, 71), there is a discrepancy between the sample list and the actual realization in the game history. I will prioritize the realization data from the 'conclude' messages. The demand in Period 3 spiked to 136, causing a stockout, while periods 1, 2, and 4 saw demand around 63-71. The average demand across the 4 concluded periods is 85. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) based on P1, P2, and P4. Current on-hand inventory is 86. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Given the high volatility (std dev approx 34), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent spike while maintaining a buffer. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 service level), which will protect against future spikes like the one in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1738.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130 (Note: The user-provided demand history in the prompt differs from the simulation history 'conclude' messages; I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages for mean calculation). Period 'conclude' demand: P1=63, P2=70, P3=136 (stockout), P4=71, P5=94. Mean demand = 86.8. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory on hand is 48. Currently, there are no in-transit units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is high (~0.95), suggesting a conservative stock level to avoid lost sales, similar to the stockout in Period 3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full history while staying responsive to any shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1504.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1, P2, P4, P5, and P6 all saw arrivals in the same period they were ordered). In P3, no order was placed, leading to a stockout because demand (136) exceeded the starting inventory (82). Average demand over the first 6 periods is approximately 86 units (63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82). The demand shows some volatility, especially the spike in P3. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (using all 6 available periods) to capture this variance while maintaining the default lead time of 0. The OR backend will calculate a base stock level to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2449.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130 (pre-game) and 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129 (in-game). The mean demand over the 7 in-game periods is approximately 92.1 units. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals to date (except Period 3 where no order was placed) have arrived within the same period (lead_time 0). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) with 0 in-transit. To avoid the stockout experienced in Period 3, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent in-game demand behavior, which averages 92.1 units. This results in a base_stock target that covers the current period's demand. Given the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 29), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat as well to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer to handle the high-end spikes (like the 129 observed in Period 7).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we ordered 139 units with a lead time of 0, which arrived and resulted in an ending inventory of 35. The observed demand over the last 8 periods has shown significant volatility, ranging from 63 to 136. Specifically, over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), demand was 71, 94, 82, 129, and 106, averaging 96.4. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true (confirmed by arrivals in P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8). To ensure high service levels while managing the holding cost of $1/unit, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current demand level, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the recent variance, especially the spikes seen in P7 and P8. L is set to default as the 0 lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1206.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, we observe a steady state with a confirmed lead time of 0 periods based on the history from Periods 1-9 (excluding Period 3 where no order was placed). Demand over the first 9 periods has a mean of 90.89 and a standard deviation of 27.5. Recent demand in Period 9 was lower than average (67), while Period 7 was high (129). There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes visible in the first 9 periods of data. I will use the 'default' lead time method (0 periods) and calculate the demand parameters based on all 9 available samples to ensure the OR backend captures the observed volatility (sigma) and mean. The current on-hand inventory of 67 is slightly below the average demand, so an order will be triggered to reach the base stock level calculated by the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1737.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1 through 10 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently at 49 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Demand since Period 1 has shown some variability but generally centers around a mean of approximately 91 units per period (sample mean of historical demand P1-P10 is 90.6). There is no strong evidence of a sustained demand regime shift or seasonality based on the current period numbers alone. Therefore, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a review period of 1 + lead time (0) = 1 period. This ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the expected demand for the current period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of approximately 90 units per period. Recent demands (P8-P11: 106, 67, 94, 86) average 88.25. The historical sample mean (including the user-provided P1-P5 samples 112, 111, 80, 129, 130 and game history P1-P11) suggests a slightly higher average, but recent performance is the best predictor of immediate future demand. As no specific calendar dates were provided, I am relying on the historical demand distribution. The lead time consistently shows 0 periods (order arrives same period). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 periods of game history to capture the current demand regime, which effectively covers the review cycle (L=0, so review+lead=1 period).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 88.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 67 units with no units in-transit. To maintain an optimal base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19.0) against the low holding cost ($1.0), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture the full history of this stable regime. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock covering the current period's demand (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. After an initial high-demand outlier in Period 3 (136 units), the demand has fluctuated between roughly 65 and 129. The average demand across all 13 observed periods is 88.3 units. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) have shown a slightly lower average of 79.4 units compared to the global average. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the stable demand and zero lead time, I will use a N=10 period window to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture recent volatility while filtering out the outlier in Period 3. This ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a ~95% service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) adequately covers demand for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a consistent lead time of 0 periods based on history. Demand has shown several peaks around 130-136 units (Periods 3, 7, 14), which resulted in stockouts in Period 3 and Period 14. The average demand across all 14 periods is approximately 91.7, but the volatility is significant. Given the high criticality (service level q = 0.95) and the current stock level of zero, I am setting the forecast based on the most recent 10 samples to capture current demand levels while calculating the standard deviation across all samples to ensure enough safety stock to cover the periodic spikes of 130+ units. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it consistently matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent variability around a mean of approximately 89 units over the last 15 periods (total demand 1332 / 15 periods = 88.8). Recent demand in Period 14 was high (136) leading to a stockout, while Period 15 was low (52). Historically, lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so 1+L=1 period). I will use the last 10 samples to capture recent demand trends while smoothing out the noise from the Period 14 spike and Period 15 dip. This N=10 window provides a balanced estimate of mu (84.4) and sigma (27.2) to inform the OR backend's service level calculation, especially given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio which favors higher stock levels to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 14.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability with an average of approximately 88 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), though individual periods fluctuate significantly (ranging from 52 to 136). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (15 out of 16 orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use the last 10 periods to estimate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture recent volatility while smoothing out extreme spikes like Period 14 (136). Lead time will remain set to the promised 0 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with an average demand of approximately 88.2 units across the last 17 periods. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There was a stockout in Period 14 due to a demand spike (136) which indicates the need for a sufficient buffer. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%). Using the last 17 periods (all available history after initial samples) provides a stable estimate for mean and variance while smoothing out the noise from individual spikes. Lead time method is kept as 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts or seasonal trends. The mean demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 91 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13 units). To satisfy upcoming demand and maintain the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use the recent 18 periods (all available history after the initial samples) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=18 provides a stable demand forecast while accounting for recent volatility (e.g., higher demand in Period 18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with no significant regime shifts or seasonal patterns identified for this period. The historical mean demand over the last 19 periods is approximately 91.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods averaging 86 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data through Period 19. Inventory on-hand is currently 47 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) provides a balanced demand estimate of roughly 90.3 units (1+0 lead time), ensuring enough stock to cover the upcoming period's demand while minimizing excess holding costs. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 20 periods. Since Period 1, the mean demand is approximately 91 units with a standard deviation around 25. Actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use a recent window of 20 periods (all available history after the initial samples) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable behavior while being responsive to any subtle drifts. Specifically, for mu_hat with L=0, the OR backend will target a base stock level covering current period demand plus a safety factor based on the profit margin (approx 95% service level).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with an average around 90-95 units over the last 20 periods. Period 21 saw a demand of 112, which is higher than the average but within the historical range (recent peaks of 118, 112, 136). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units) compared to the expected demand of ~90 units. I will use a recent window of 18 samples (excluding the initialization noise from Period 1-3) to estimate mean and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the observed 0-period lead time. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the current demand regime's mean (approx 93) and variance.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observed from Period 1 to 22 shows significant fluctuation, with a mean around 91 units and a standard deviation around 24. While specific 'Period_X' dates are provided without a calendar context, the demand has remained roughly within the 52-136 range. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use L=0. To capture the most relevant demand pattern while filtering out early noise, I'll use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 13-22). This allows the OR engine to adapt to the most recent behavior where demand averaged ~90.7 units. With a target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, the system will maintain stock slightly above the mean to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 3 and 14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2186.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently low (18 units) after a period of high demand (116 units in Period 23). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 19-23) has been 86, 72, 112, 102, 116, resulting in a recent mean of 97.6. This reflects a slight upward trend compared to the long-term average (which is around 90-95 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the service level should be set high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent increase in demand and ensure sufficient stock to cover the next immediate period (Lead Time = 0, Review Period = 1). L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 21: average demand increased to ~110 compared to the previous long-term average of ~85-90.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a higher-volume regime starting at Period 21. Demand over the last four periods has been 112, 102, 116, and 133 (average ~115.8), compared to the previous long-term average of approximately 88. In Period 24, we experienced a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 128 against demand 133). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated regime while slightly accounting for the recent peak (mu_hat calculation will be (1+0) * ~115.8). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility seen in this new demand phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts while maximizing profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1882.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear regime shift starting around Period 21. Prior to this, demand averaged approximately 88 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand values were 112, 102, 116, 133, and 101, yielding a new average of approximately 112 units/period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in all concluded periods. Therefore, I am setting L to 'default' (0) and adjusted mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent 27% increase in mean demand, helping to prevent stockouts like those seen in Period 24.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 21. The long-term average (P1-P20) was approximately 87, but the recent 6 periods (P21-P26) show a much higher average of approximately 108 (112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84). I will use N=6 to capture this recent higher-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history where orders placed and arrived in the same period. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current higher demand and variability, maintaining a high service level (~95% given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio) while avoiding excessive overstocking based on the older, lower-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1644.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 24 (starting Period 21) continues to be the dominant driver. Since Period 21, demand has averaged approximately 105.3 units (112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84, 89), which is significantly higher than the initial periods. I will use a window of the last 7 periods (N=7, specifically from P21 to P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand state while excluding the lower-demand history. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. By focusing on the recent N samples, the OR backend will calculate a base stock level that accurately reflects the current higher average demand (~105) and current volatility, ensuring sufficiently high stock to meet demand while managing holding costs for this high-profit SKU ($19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1627.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a distinct regime shift since Period 21. Before Period 21, demand averaged ~87 units. Between Periods 21 and 28, the average demand rose to approximately 103 units per period (112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84, 89, 88). This shift was previously noted in the carry-over insights starting at P21. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true for all 28 periods of history (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. To ensure high service levels for this high-margin item (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1) while respecting the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 21 to 28) to focus on the higher mean and the specific volatility of the current period. L is kept at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 21-28 average demand is ~103 (vs ~87 in P1-P20), a ~18% increase sustainment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1769.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that started around Period 21. The average demand from Period 21 to Period 29 is approximately 102.2 units per period, which is significantly higher than the earlier average. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods and the consistent observation that actual lead time has been 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable in Period N), I am setting L to the promised lead time of 0 using the 'default' method. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the current high-demand regime (P21-P29). Similarly, I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility observed during this period, ensuring the OR backend can maintain an appropriate service level for the current demand environment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. For the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is approximately 102.7 units per period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~87. Recent demand samples (P28: 88, P29: 95, P30: 97) support this elevated level. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels are adjusted for the ~18% increase in average demand observed in the latter half of the game. This approach balances the stock-out risk seen in Period 24 with the holding costs of the higher volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the elevated regime that began around Period 21. While individual period demand fluctuates (Period 31 recorded 69 units), the rolling average since Period 21 remains approximately 98 units, which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~87 units. I am maintaining the focus on this recent regime (N=11, covering Period 21 to Period 31). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To ensure the OR backend captures this sustained shift while ignoring pre-Period 21 noise, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N method with N=11. This captures the current mean of ~98 and the associated volatility to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1812.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. For Periods 21-32, the average demand is approximately 98.7, which is a clear increase from the pre-Period 21 average of ~87. Recent demand (last 3 periods) shows some minor fluctuation (69, 97, 95) but remains consistent with this elevated level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 31 units on-hand with zero in-transit. To ensure we capture the most relevant demand statistics for this higher regime, I will use a recent_N window of 12 (covering Periods 21-32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock target that accounts for the observed ~100 unit mean demand and the underlying volatility of this new regime, while treating lead time as 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified in Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 33, the mean demand is approximately 100 units (mean=99.5), confirming the sustained increase from the initial mean of ~87. Recent demand (P31: 69, P32: 97, P33: 111) remains volatile but aligned with this higher average. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, as evidenced by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To maintain high service levels (profit $19 vs holding cost $1) under this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (from P21 onwards) to ensure the OR backend captures the current mean and variance accurately. L remains set to default (0).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained regime shift that began around Period 21. For the period P21-P34, the average demand is approximately 100 units per period (compared to ~87 in P1-P20). Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P30-P34) averages 95 units, and in the last 14 periods (the entire shift period) is 99.8. I will set N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this higher demand regime fully while maintaining recent sensitivity. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory levels have stayed relatively low, resulting in several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (e.g., P33 ending OH 15, P34 ending OH 25), suggesting the safety stock needs to comfortably cover the higher variance observed in this new regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 100 units per period (compared to ~87 in the earlier phase). Recent demand (last 10 periods, P26-P35) remains stable around this higher level (avg ~91). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual performance, as orders habitually arrive within the same period. For Period 36, I am using a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out the volatility observed since Period 21. This ensures a base stock level that targets a high service level (since the critical ratio is 19/20 or 95%) while accounting for the recent mean and variance.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted upward around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 36 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 100.6 units (compared to ~87 previously). Recent volatility has also stabilized. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual observations. To account for this sustained higher demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering the period since the shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current average demand of ~100 units/period while maintaining a sufficient safety stock for the observed variance in this regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified around Period 21. Since Period 33, demand has been consistently higher, averaging approximately 106 units (P33-P37: 111, 102, 96, 112, 110). This is a slight uptick from the previous 103 average noted in earlier insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Given the recent consistency of this higher demand level, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most current demand behavior (P33-P37) while maintaining a lead time estimate of 0. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the slightly elevated recent demand and protects against the volatility seen in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 33-37 average demand is ~106 units, compared to the Period 21-32 average of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2222.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime. Since Period 33, demand has been consistently higher, with an average of approximately 108.5 units (P33-P38: 111, 102, 96, 112, 110, 117). The most recent period (P38) saw a demand of 117, leaving only 1 unit on-hand. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To prevent stockouts in this higher-demand environment, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (approx 108) and volatility (approx 7.7) of this higher regime. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the immediate demand plus a safety stock buffer tuned to recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~108 units/period starting P33 (P33-P38 average: 108.5, vs P21-P32 average: ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1699.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 33. Analysis of the most recent data (P33-P39) shows an average demand of approximately 105.7 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight noting a stabilization around 108 units. Period 39 specifically saw a demand of 91, which is slightly lower but within normal variance for this regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the service level (q) is 0.95, justifying a robust base stock to avoid stockouts, which have occurred twice in history (P14, P24). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime dynamics (P33-P39) while filtering out the lower demand periods prior to P33. L will be set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1978.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, consistent with the carry-over insights. From Period 33 to Period 40, the average demand is approximately 105.75 units per period. The most recent demand (P40) was 105 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to Period 40. With an on-hand inventory of only 17 units and no units in transit, we must order enough to cover the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 33, while keeping L at default (0) to reflect the observed same-period delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward trend, stabilizing at approximately 108-110 units per period since Period 33. The average demand for the last 9 periods (P33-P41) is 105.1 units, with the most recent sample at 120. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. With profit at $19 and holding cost at $1, the target service level is high (95%), necessitating a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand data. L is set to default as the lead time of 0 is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1737.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a persistent high-demand regime that stabilized around Period 33. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 42 is approximately 106 units per period. The most recent three periods (P40-P42) show demand of 105, 120, and 93, maintaining this elevated level. Lead time consistency is reliable at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture the current regime while filtering out noise, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods (P33-P42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this corresponds to the identified stable regime shift mentioned in the carry-over insights. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand mean (~106) and its associated volatility, while the profit-to-holding cost ratio (~95% service level) provides a safety buffer against stockouts which have occurred when inventory was too lean (e.g., P3, P14, P24, P41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1737.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained higher regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 105.4 units (P33-P43: 111, 102, 96, 112, 110, 117, 91, 105, 120, 93, 93). While there was a slight dip in the last two periods (93 and 93), the overall trend since P33 remains significantly higher than the initial periods. I will use a window of the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture this most recent sustained regime shift starting from Period 33. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as indicated by the history of same-period arrivals (all orders placed arrive within the same period). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the backend's observation of this 0-period lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand mean and variance while ignoring the lower historical data from before P33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~105 units/period starting P33 (P33-P43 average: 105.4), confirming the upward shift from the previous ~100 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1078.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward shift across the game history. Initially (P1-P20), mean demand was ~88. From P21-P32, it increased to ~100. From P33 to the most recent period (P44), the mean has stabilized around 102 units/period (P33-P44 average: 102.1), although P44 saw a specific dip to 60. Given the consistent history of lead time = 0, I will continue using the promised lead time. I am selecting N=12 for demand parameters to capture the current high-demand regime starting from P33 (12 periods: P33-P44) while smoothing out the recent lower sample in P44. The on-hand inventory is 62, and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, which the base-stock policy will maintain using these regime-specific estimates.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward shift across the game. Early periods (P1-P20) averaged ~87 units. A shift occurred around P21 (P21-P32 average ~100), and a further stabilization occurred from P33 onwards. The current demand regime (P33-P45) is averaging 100.2 units per period, though the most recent two periods (P44-P45) showed a dip to 60 and 68. Despite this recent dip, the high service level requirements (Profit/Holding ratio of 19:1) dictate maintaining a base stock that covers the higher stabilized mean of ~105-110 observed in the P33-P43 window. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To account for the stabilized higher demand and volatility while balancing the recent low-demand outliers, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the P33-P45 period). This ensures the OR backend captures the higher average while incorporating the recent variance.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting around Period 33, with an average demand of approximately 101.4 units (P33-P46). Although the most recent historical samples provided (P1-P5) are much higher (avg 112.4), those appear to be from a different initialization phase and don't reflect the current stable regime observed in the game history. The current on-hand inventory is low (15 units) following a demand of 113 in Period 46. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a critical ratio of 0.95, I will focus on the most recent 14 periods (P33-P46) to capture the current demand level while maintaining a high service level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Therefore, I'll set L to default (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N with N=14 to reflect the stabilized higher demand regime while protecting against volatility.

Recent demand in the last three periods has fluctuated (68, 113, 97), so I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Parameters are tuned to a high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) to prevent stockouts, which have occurred occasionally in the history.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistent with the higher regime identified around Period 33. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 48 is approximately 100 units (mean: 100.2). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P44-P48) have shown a demand pattern of 60, 68, 113, 97, and 95 (mean: 86.6), but this includes a significant dip in Periods 44-45 which appears to be transient rather than a new sustained regime. The Carry-over insight from P44 suggested a stabilization at ~105, while the slightly wider window P33-P48 averages 100. Given we are at Period 49 (nearly the end of the 50-period horizon), and on-hand inventory is 33, I will focus on the most stable recent regime. I've chosen N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the performance since the Period 33 stabilization point, reflecting a mean of ~100 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Daily Profit: $2280.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2273.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean since Period 33. Calculating the average demand from Period 33 to Period 49 (17 periods) yields approximately 99.4 units, with recent fluctuations between 60 and 120. The most recent demand (Period 49) was 120, and on-hand inventory is currently very low (7 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) and the low starting inventory, I will utilize the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this stable high-demand regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent volatility and mean demand while minimizing the risk of stockouts in the current period.
