The product 'chips(Regular)' has a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, leading to a critical fractile of 0.8. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 112 units (samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130). The OR recommendation of 130 units is derived from this mean plus safety stock.

However, those samples might represent future volatility or specific segments. 3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 66 units is based on the historical mean (~112) but is capped at 66 units. Given that current inventory is 57 and demand is trending around 63-70, we need to order enough to meet Period 3 demand. If demand is 70, we need 70 total available.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive and be available for demand in this same period (Period 50). This is the final period of the game, so ending inventory carries no value and incurs holding costs. Therefore, the strategy should be to order exactly enough to cover the expected demand for Period 50, minus any existing on-hand inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 0 units. Looking at recent history, demand has fluctuated between approximately 60 and 120 units, with an average around 100. The OR recommendation of 115 units is based on a high service level (95%). Given the high 'profit to holding cost' ratio (4:1), it is safer to lean toward the higher end of demand estimates to avoid a stockout in this final period. Period 49 demand was 120, and the previous samples from the prompt (Period 1-5) showed similar levels (112, 111, 80, 129, 130). I will follow the OR recommendation of 115 to ensure high fill-rate for the final period.",
