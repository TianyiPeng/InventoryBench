Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to maintain a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs while meeting demand. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in time to fulfill this period's demand. I will target the historical average plus a small buffer to account for the variance observed in the sample data (max demand was 111).

The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. To maximize profit and meet this higher demand regime while accounting for the high volatility (145 in P9), I need to increase the order size significantly. Operating at 0 on-hand inventory at the start of the period requires ordering enough to cover the forecasted demand plus a small buffer, as holding cost ($1) is equal to profit ($1).

With current on-hand inventory at 12 units and a target stock level based on the mean demand plus a conservative safety margin to account for recent spikes (like the 142 in P15), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover Period 17's demand. Aiming for a total availability of 120 units (which covers the recent mean and protects against moderate spikes) requires ordering 108 units (Target 120 - On-hand 12). Given the $1.00 profit vs $1.00 holding cost, the inventory penalty for overstocking is equal to the penalty for stocking out, favoring a balanced approach around the mean.",
