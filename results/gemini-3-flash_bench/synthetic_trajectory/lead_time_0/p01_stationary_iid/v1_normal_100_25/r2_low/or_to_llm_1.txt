Recent demand has been volatile (P7: 54, P8: 104, P9: 52), making simple averaging tricky. The cumulative average including the user-provided initial 5 samples (P1-P5: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111) is 84.8 units.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand inventory is 35 units. There is 0 in-transit inventory.\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 49 units. With L=0, the base-stock level targets one period of demand plus safety stock. OR's calculation: [Estimated mean demand (~84) + Safety stock] - On-hand (35) = 49. This implies a targeted base-stock inventory level of approx 84 units.\n5. Strategy Adjustment: Given L=0 and a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the service level requirement is moderate. An order of 49 units brings the total supply for Period 10 to 84 units (35+49). This is the historical mean. To avoid potential stockouts seen in P8 where demand hit 104, I will slightly pad the OR recommendation to cover closer to the high-end demand while respecting the holding cost. I will order 65 units to have 100 on-hand, which covers most high-demand scenarios observed.",

However, as noted in the Carry-over Insight from Period 29, recent demand has shifted upwards.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation is 93 units. Checking the recent demand history (P40-P48), the average demand is approximately 101.4 units (D_40=108, D_41=101, D_42=113, D_43=77, D_44=78, D_45=99, D_46=128, D_47=102, D_48=107). This confirms the demand regime shift identified in the carry-over insights (P25-P40) where demand increased from ~87 to ~95+, and currently seems to be trending even higher (near 100+). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Since Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50), I need to cover the expected demand for today to maximize profit and avoid a stockout. Given the recent average of ~102 and the fact that we have frequently seen peaks around 110-128 in this regime, I will order 105 units. This slightly exceeds the OR recommendation (which is likely weighed down by early low-demand periods) to better match the sustained higher demand level.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation from 93 back to 105 units to match the sustained high-demand regime (~102 average) and prevent stockouts in the final periods.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, which is confirmed by consistent historical data (e.g., Period 49 order arrived in Period 49). Analysis of demand shows a clear regime shift: the early historical average was ~87 units, but since Period 25 and especially Period 40, demand has averaged ~101 units. In the most recent period (P49), demand peaked at 144, resulting in a stockout. My current inventory is 0. The OR recommendation of 94 units is based on the full historical average and is too low given the recent sustained average of ~101 and recent high-demand spikes. To prevent another stockout and account for the higher demand regime, I am increasing the order quantity to 110 units.",
