Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is available: 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111. The mean demand is 89.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.0. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) setup, the critical ratio is 0.5 (z \u2248 0), meaning the base stock policy will aim to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. Since this is the first period of decision-making, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the characteristics of the initial provided demand sample. There is no evidence yet of lead time drift or seasonality beyond the initial variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 90 units, and since the promised lead time is 0, they arrived in the same period. The demand was 89, leaving 1 unit on hand. Historical demand over 5 periods is: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111. The mean of these 5 samples is 89.8 with a standard deviation of 16.7. Since L=0, the review+lead period consists of 1 period (L+1=1). Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0, so the critical ratio q is 0.5 (z* = 0). The OR backend will set base_stock = mu_hat. I will use all 5 historical samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current status shows 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. Based on the game history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has held true for both Period 1 and Period 2 (orders arrived within the same period). In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (demand 98, sold 88), indicating the need for a slightly higher base stock. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows values of 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111 (mean ~89.8, std ~16.4). The actual sales/demand in the first two periods were 89 and 98, which align with these samples. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full range of the provided historical samples and recent performance while reacting to the slightly higher demand seen in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and an upward trend: P1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92. Note that the 'GAME HISTORY' section lists demand differently than the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' snippet; I will prioritize the game history which shows P1: 89, P2: 98, P3: 114. This indicates a clear upward trend. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In both P2 and P3, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, demand > sold), likely because the OR backend's 'cap' or base-stock calculation didn't account for the rising demand since it defaults to using all history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this upward movement aggressively. For L, I will use 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increasing variance seen in the stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the previous four periods all experienced a lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). Demand has been relatively stable around 100 units (samples: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 - average 89.8), but we have consistently stocked out or hit zero inventory in Periods 2, 3, and 4, indicating that the base stock level is tight relative to demand variability. Since Period 5 demand is 111, and we started Period 5 with 0 on-hand inventory, we need to ensure the order placed in the decision phase (which arrives same-period due to L=0) covers this period's demand. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent patterns while excluding the first sample if it's less representative, though here all 5 samples are relevant. I will set L to 'calculate' to rely on the observed history of 0-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the history of 'chips(Regular)'. The product has a high turnover, but also a very high holding cost relative to profit ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost), leading to an optimal service level (q) of 0.5. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand samples are [89, 98, 114, 101, 48]. Period 5 showed a significant drop to 48, which might be a random fluctuation or the start of a lower demand regime. Given the risk of high holding costs and the current on-hand inventory of 55, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and variance to capture the most recent trend while acknowledging the overall mean. L remains at the promised 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will reflect (1+L) which is 1 * mean/std.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history (Periods 1-6), demand for chips(Regular) has shown two distinct phases: Periods 1-4 had an average demand of 100.5, while Periods 5-6 saw a drop to 48 and 63 (average 55.5). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units with no units in transit. Given the recent drop in demand starting at Period 5, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the current lower-demand regime more heavily, while still considering a small amount of history to handle volatility. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 0.5), which favors leaning towards the mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 5: Average demand decreased from ~100 to ~55 (-45%). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are following a demand regime shift that occurred at Period 5. Demand samples for the initial regime (P1-P4) were 89, 98, 114, 101 (average ~100.5). Demand samples for the new regime (P5-P7) are 48, 63, 54 (average ~55). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1 through 7. Because the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should approximately equal the median (mean) demand. Given the clear step-change in demand, I will use a window of N=3 (P5, P6, P7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the current lower demand level while ignoring the higher initial samples. L remains at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand spiked to 104 units, causing a stockout as we only had 55 units available. This spike contradicts the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 7 that suggested a sustained drop to ~55. We are now seeing high volatility: demand in Periods 1-4 averaged ~100, Periods 5-7 averaged ~55, and Period 8 jumped back to 104. Because the 'new' demand regime (Period 5-7) was immediately followed by a high demand period (Period 8), the previous assumption of a lower stable regime is now questionable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (spanning the low-demand periods and the recent spike) to capture this volatility while moving the mu_hat back towards a higher mean. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are evaluating 'chips(Regular)' at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the demand regime shift previously identified at Period 5 (mean dropping to ~55) was interrupted by a significant spike in Period 8 (demand=104). Prior to the spike (P5-P7), demand was 48, 63, 54 (Avg=55). After the spike (P9), demand was 52. Averaging the regime from P5 to P9 (48, 63, 54, 104, 52) gives a mean of 64.2. Since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the service level 'q' target is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. A lead time of 0 is confirmed across all periods (P1-P9). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this new regime starting at P5, which balances the sudden spike with the lower observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has exhibited high volatility following the initial drop at Period 5. While the previous carry-over insight noted a decrease from ~100 to ~55, recent periods (P8 and P10) show demand spikes (104 and 83 respectively), suggesting the mean is higher than 55 or that volatility is very high. Calculating the mean from P5 to P10 gives approx 67.33. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-shift behavior, which should result in a mu_hat of approx 67 and a sigma_hat reflecting the increased variance to avoid the stockouts observed in P8 and P10.

Carry-over insight: Updated demand regime: Post-Period 5 mean is approx 67 units with high volatility (range 48-104), leading to frequent stockouts when inventory is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 5. Since Period 5, demand has been highly volatile (range 48-104) with an average of approximately 71.2 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95). The system is currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) due to demand exceeding recent supply. With a critical profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 0.5 (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5), the base stock should target the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the data post-shift (Periods 5-11). Lead time is consistently 0. Using N=7 for sigma_hat will also incorporate the significant volatility observed in this period, preventing frequent stockouts while acknowledging the holding cost parity.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history since Period 5 shows a mean of approximately 71 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95, 62). However, demand is highly volatile, ranging from 48 to 104 units. In periods 8, 10, and 11, we experienced stockouts because inventory levels were insufficient to meet demand spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the unit profit ($1.0), the OR backend's default service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. To protect against stockouts during these higher-volatility spikes while respecting the parity between holding costs and profit, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the full length of the current demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, providing a more relevant baseline than the full history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained demand regime shift that began around Period 5. Previous analysis from Period 11 suggested a mean of ~67, but calculating from the shift (Periods 5-13), the average demand is 69.88 units with a range between 48 and 104. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. The high volatility relative to the mean (Std Dev ~18) often results in stockouts when inventory is low because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), leading the OR backend to target a 50% service level by default. To prevent excessive lost sales while acknowledging the high holding cost, I will use the recent 9 periods (post-shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides the most relevant data for the current regime while ensuring the baseline for the order covers the expected mean of approximately 70 units.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime for Period 5-13: Average demand is 69.9 units (previous estimate 67) with standard deviation of ~18.3. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand spiked significantly to 128 units, which is much higher than the previous regime average of ~70. This may indicate a new demand shift or a high-variance outlier. Stockouts occurred because the inventory level was based on the previous average. For Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the recent spike, I will increase the demand forecast's sensitivity to capture potential upward trends by using the last 5 samples (averaging ~83.4). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted to account for the increased volatility seen in recent periods (range 62 to 128).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility in demand regime starting Period 5; demand spike in Period 14 (128 units) suggests potential for higher mean or increased variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted after Period 5, but the last two periods (P14: 128, P15: 107) show a significant upward spike compared to the P5-P13 average of ~70. This suggests either a new regime or a temporary high-demand period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced frequent stockouts (P14, P15), I will increase the demand forecast. I am using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5-15) to capture the overall post-shift behavior while incorporating the recent spikes. The lead time remains consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the lower average from earlier periods and the recent high-volatility spikes, aiming to prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand observed in Periods 14-15 (avg 117.5) vs previous P5-P13 avg (70), indicating a possible secondary regime shift or increased volatility plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a distinct upward shift from the previous average. From Period 5 to 13, the average demand was approximately 70 units. However, in the last three periods (14, 15, 16), demand jumped significantly (128, 107, 80), resulting in an average of 105 units. Because the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has consistently resulted in stockouts (sold < demand in 5 of the last 10 periods), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and ensure sufficient stock for Period 17. The lead time L is consistently 0, so I will maintain the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed second demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand increased from ~70 avg to ~105 avg (Periods 14-16), returning to levels seen in Periods 1-4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As noted in the Period 17 carry-over insight, the demand regime has shifted back up to a higher mean (avg ~105) since Period 14, similar to the initial levels seen in Periods 1-4. In Period 17, demand was 77, and we starting Period 18 with 28 units on-hand. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the current high volatility (std dev ~21 over the last 4 periods) and the profit vs holding cost ratio (1:1), the critical safety stock needs to be robust but mindful of the 0 lead time. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the latest demand regime shifts for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it is consistently 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a confirmed secondary regime shift starting in Period 14, where demand returned to early-game levels (approx 100). Recent demand figures from P14 to P18 are 128, 107, 80, 77, and 104, averaging 99.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 20.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 18, so we need to set parameters that cover the high-demand regime to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this specific post-Period 14 behavior, ensuring the base-stock calculation reflects the higher mean (approx 100) and current volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift at Period 14, returning to a higher average level similar to the first 4 periods. In the current regime (Periods 14-19), the average demand is 97.0 (128, 107, 80, 77, 104, 86) with a standard deviation of approximately 18.67. The on-hand inventory is 14, and there is 0 in-transit inventory. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the fact that holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), the target service level q = 0.5. However, due to recent stockouts and the higher demand variance in this new regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this latest demand shift precisely, allowing the OR engine to set the base stock for the current period (L+1=1) based on the mean and variance of this specific window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand spiked to 141 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Since Period 14, we have seen a sustained higher demand regime. Analyzing demand from Period 14 to Period 20: 128, 107, 80, 77, 104, 86, 141. The mean for these 7 periods is approximately 103.3 units, significantly higher than the previous P5-P13 mean of ~70. This confirms the secondary regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture these higher demand spikes (especially after the 141 unit observation), I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus only on the most recent 7-period regime (N=7). Period 21 starts with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 14 confirmed: mean increased from ~70 to ~103 (+47%) through Period 20. High volatility remains present with spikes reaching 141 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 14, moving from an average of ~70 units back to a higher level of ~103 units, with significant volatility (spikes up to 141). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we must order to meet the higher demand average. I am setting N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full extent of this new high-demand regime (Periods 14-21) while balancing the noise from individual spikes. This ensures the base stock level (calculated using the profit/holding cost ratio) is responsive to the recent increased mean and volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14, moving from a mean of ~70 to a higher level. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P14-P22), the average demand is approximately 101 units, which is remarkably stable compared to the early game volatility but still includes significant spikes (reaching 141 in P20). Lead time is confirmed and stable at 0 periods across the entire history. Choosing N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR model on this current high-demand regime while capturing the relevant variance to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 14, 15, 16, 18, and 20. Current on-hand is 18, and with a target base stock likely around 120-130 based on this regime, the system needs to order to cover the immediate demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 14, returning to a higher average of approximately 103 units based on data from Periods 14 to 23. This regime is characterized by high volatility, with demand ranging from 70 to 141. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To capture this most recent sustained demand pattern (10 periods of data), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 (the length of the current regime starting at P14). On-hand inventory is currently at 32, and since lead time is 0, the backend will calculate an order based on target base stock minus 32 to cover the incoming demand. Using a service level target (implied by the profit/holding ratio being 1.0/1.0, or q=0.5) needs to be balanced against the high variance to avoid significant stockouts seen in Periods 18 and 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a stable high-demand regime that began around Period 14. For Periods 14-24, the average demand is approximately 100 units (mean = 99.8), which is a significant increase from the previous Period 5-13 regime (~70 units). Recent demand reflects continued high volatility with a range of 70 to 141. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while accounting for recent fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=11 (covering Period 14 to Period 24). This allows the OR backend to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this specific regime, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet current demand patterns and minimize stockouts, which have occurred in 3 of the last 7 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at a higher level compared to the Period 5-13 dip. Analysis of Period 14 to Period 25 shows an average demand of approximately 102.3 units with a standard deviation of about 19.8. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. By setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will capture the properties of this current high-demand, high-volatility regime (Periods 14-25). This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~102) and captures the volatility required to maintain a high service level, which is critical given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1/unit), implying a target service level of 50%, although the capping mechanism and formula typically favor slightly more protection against stockouts when volatility is this clear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the secondary regime shift established around Period 14. In the most recent periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged approximately 95.7 units (P21: 102, P22: 86, P23: 70, P24: 113, P25: 104, P26: 99), similar to the broader P14-P26 average of ~99.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the service level target (critical ratio = 0.5 where Profit=1 and Holding=1), the base stock should ideally hover around the median demand. However, historical volatility is high (std dev ~20-25). I will use the last 13 periods (N=13, covering Period 14 to Period 26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire current demand regime and provides a more stable estimate of the mean and variance compared to a shorter window.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 14. Over the last 14 periods (P14-P27), the average demand is approximately 103.2 units with a standard deviation of about 19.8. This regime is similar to the initial periods (P1-P4). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Despite frequent stockouts early in this regime, the system is now better aligned. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), the backend's base-stock calculation will aim for the median (50th percentile). To capture this current demand level and account for the observed volatility while minimizing stockouts, I will use a window of the last 14 periods for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This window covers the entire duration of the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 14. Analyzing demand from Period 14 to Period 28, the average is approximately 98.4 units per period (1476 total units / 15 periods). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the most recent 15 periods (starting from the identified regime shift) reflect the current market conditions better than the earlier low-demand phase (Periods 5-13), I am setting N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that covers the expected demand of ~98 units plus a safety stock buffer to handle the observed volatility (demand ranges from 70 to 141 in this regime). With an on-hand inventory of 20 units and L=0, the OR engine will order approximately 80-100 units to reach the calculated base stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14, returning to a higher average similar to the first four periods. Over the last 16 periods (P14-P29), the average demand is 101.5 units, which is significantly higher than the P5-P13 average (~70). The recent demand remains highly volatile, with a local peak of 138 units in Period 29 following 81 units in Period 28. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~100 unit/period average while accounting for the significant standard deviation observed in this window (approx 21 units), thereby reducing stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 to Period 29 has stabilized at a higher mean of 101.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 14, with a mean of approximately 101.5 and a standard deviation of 21.0. Period 30 saw a lower demand of 65, which resulted in an ending inventory of 37. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the goal is to set parameters that cover the replenishment cycle (1 + L = 1 period). Given the secondary regime shift at P14, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=17 (Periods 14 to 30) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the lower demand period between P5 and P13. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, though the capped policy behaves slightly differently).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized with a mean around 100 units. Period 30 saw lower demand (65) and Period 31 was also below average (85), but looking at the range from Period 14 to 31 (approx 100 avg), we remain in the second regime. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 15. I will use the recent regime (Period 14-31, N=18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we cover the expected demand of ~100 while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~21) observed in this regime. This strategy targets the optimal service level where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), meaning we aim for the median demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14 and has maintained a higher average. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 14-32), the average demand is approximately 100.8 units per period with a standard deviation of 21.3. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The last period (P32) saw an inventory stockout with demand (116) exceeding the available units (99), highlighting the need to maintain sufficient base stock to cover demand volatility. I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the regime from Period 14 to 32) to capture this stabilized higher demand segment for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 14 to Period 33 (the last 20 periods), the mean demand is approximately 101.9 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. This regime has remained stable for 20 periods. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to estimate the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this current stable, high-demand regime while accounting for its inherent volatility. This will configure the base stock to cover expected demand and a safety buffer for the next period.

In Period 34, demand was 76 units, and we ended with 25 units on-hand. Since the lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period, allowing us to meet current period demand. I will use the recent demand regime (Periods 14-34, N=21) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the high demand spikes (observed up to 141) while accounting for the current 25 units on-hand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 101 units and significant volatility (std dev ~21). In the most recent periods (P30-P35), demand has fluctuated between 65 and 116 units, with the latest observation being 114. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (quantile q) is 0.5, meaning it seeks to set the base stock at the median of the demand distribution to balance inventory risk. To capture the current regime while allowing for recent variability, I am using recent_N=22 (covering the Period 14-35 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 0 periods.

Analysis of demand from Period 14 to Period 36 shows a mean of approximately 100.3 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0 units. Recently, demand has fluctuated between 76 and 116 units (Periods 32-36). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Current on-hand inventory is 10 units with no in-transit stock. Since the review + lead time period is essentially 1 period (due to L=0), I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the current period using the statistics from the current regime (N=23, from P14 to P36). Sigma_hat will be set to reflect the regime's volatility to maintain a high service level, given that the profit per unit equals the holding cost (suggesting a 50% base service level requirement, which the OR engine will adjust via the critical fractile).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-mean regime since Period 14. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 to Period 37 shows a mean of approximately 100 units (65, 85, 116, 115, 76, 114, 90, 119), which is consistent with the CARRY-OVER INSIGHT from Period 30. Lead time is significantly stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding order in the history. In Period 37, the demand was 119 and on-hand inventory was reduced to 0. Since the review plus lead time period is 1 (L=0), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering the regime from P14 to P37) to capture this current stable demand level while accounting for the high volatility observed (standard deviation is approx 19-21 in this regime). This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers demand spikes like the recent 119 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at the 'high' level established in Period 14 (mean ~100). Analyzing demand from Period 30 to Period 38 (the last 9 periods), the average demand is approximately 92.2 units, but this includes a significant dip in Period 38 (49 units). Historically, this SKU exhibits high volatility with frequent spikes above 110 units. The current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Given a lead time of 0 (consistent throughout history), the order arrives within the same period. The current 'regime' for demand since Period 14 continues to show a mean of ~100. I will use recent_N with N=25 to capture the full stability of this high-demand period while smoothing out the recent low outlier in Period 38. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high variance (std ~21) and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which targets a 50% service level plus safety stock for volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-mean regime since Period 14, following an earlier dip. Demand from Period 14 to Period 39 averages approximately 99.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Period 38 saw a low demand (49), while Period 39 returned to 84 units, which is within the normal range for this regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all concluding messages. With on-hand inventory at 14 units and the OR engine calculating order quantities based on base_stock - pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=26, representing the current regime since P14) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. This ensures mu_hat is based on the ~100 unit average and sigma_hat accounts for the ~22 unit standard deviation, allowing the OR engine to maintain a service level appropriate for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level base stock, though the backend's capped policy provides additional safety).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established at Period 14, with a mean around 101.5 units. Recent performance (P30-P40) maintains this level despite some high volatility spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit), implying a target service level of 50%. However, due to several stockouts when demand exceeds inventory (e.g., P32, P33, P35, P37, P40), maintaining a buffer is beneficial to capture all demand. I am using recent_N (N=27, from P14 to P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at the 'high' level identified around Period 14. For the most recent 28 periods (P14-P41), the mean demand is approximately 98.7 units with a standard deviation of about 21.5 units. Recent fluctuations (P38: 49, P40: 108, P41: 101) demonstrate continued high volatility. Inventory is currently at 0 following a slight stockout in Period 41 (demand 101 vs supply 98). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they are placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=28 to capture the statistics of this current regime (P14-P41), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical variance while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 14 (mean ~102, std ~21) continues to be the dominant driver for chips(Regular). Since Period 30, the demand has averaged approximately 97.4 units with consistent volatility, frequently causing stockouts when ending inventory hits 0. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 43, I will use recent_N (N=13, from Period 30 to 42) to capture the current stable but high-volatility regime. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent demand patterns (avg ~97.4, std ~24.9) while accounting for the same-day delivery (L=0). Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on historical lead time performance, which has consistently been 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 21.0, as noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 30). Recent demand from Period 41-43 (101, 113, 77) aligns with this historical mean (avg 97). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=30 to encompass the entire stable regime from Period 14 to Period 43, providing a robust statistical basis for the OR backend. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for current environmental volatility while the 0-period lead time minimizes the risk of excessive holding costs since inventory replenishment is immediate within the same period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained high-mean regime since Period 14. Analyzing the last 31 periods (Period 14 to Period 44), the mean demand is approximately 98.4 units with a standard deviation of about 21.3. Recent performance in Periods 40-44 shows a slight dip (avg 95.4), but demand remains highly volatile with frequent 'sold out' events when stock is nearly matched to the mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (the median). However, to account for the high volatility and potential for stockouts seen in the history, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=31 to capture this stable secondary regime since Period 14. This provides the OR engine with the most relevant mean and variance to calculate the base-stock level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 14, with a mean of approximately 101.5 units and significant volatility. Currently, we are at Period 46 with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To maximize reward given the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (a 50% critical ratio, as q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), the base stock level target should be the median of the demand distribution for the review+lead period (which is (1+0)=1 period). The mean demand from Period 14 to Period 45 (32 samples) is approximately 97.5 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0. I am using recent_N with N=32 to capture this established regime while smoothing out the recent minor fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to meet the expected demand of the current period without over-stocking, effectively aiming for a 50% service level as per the cost structure.

Recent performance (Periods 40-46) shows continued high demand, frequently exceeding 100 units, which has led to several stockouts including the most recent period (P46). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maximize reward, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 33 periods (Period 14-46) to capture this specific regime's characteristics accurately, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet demand and prevent stockouts while balancing the risk of holding costs. Lead time L is kept at the default (promised) value of 0.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 98.7 units and a standard deviation of 21.0 units over the last 34 periods (P14-P47). The most recent demand samples (P40-P47) show a similar mean of 100.75, confirming the regime's stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. However, given the high volatility and the cost of missed sales, I will use a recent window (N=34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable but volatile regime from Period 14 onwards. Current inventory is 0, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on this base stock minus 0 pipeline. I'm using N=34 to cover the entire secondary regime up to the current period (Period 48).

The demand regime since Period 14 has remained consistent with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of about 21.0. Recent periods (P45-P48) have shown demand values of 99, 128, 102, and 107, which align with this higher demand state. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. For Period 49, I will use a recent_N approach with N=35 to capture the stable behavior since the shift at Period 14 (P14 to P48 = 35 samples). This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock using the correct demand mean and volatility which have been verified over the last 35 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at a higher mean since Period 14. Analysis of demand from Period 14 to Period 49 shows an average of approximately 99.1 units with a standard deviation of 22.3. Recent demand has been particularly high (Period 49: 144 units), but zero on-hand inventory at the start of Period 50 reflects consistent stockouts when demand exceeds the order cap. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical concluding messages. To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0, implying a 50% critical ratio target), I will use the last 36 periods (N=36, covering the entire Period 14-49 regime) to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained higher mean and significant volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 14 to Period 49 remains stable with a mean of 99.1 and standard deviation of 22.3.
