Historical data for the first 5 periods shows an average demand of approximately 90 units (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand occurring in Period 1. Since starting on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Given the historical average is ~90 and the most recent high was 111, I will order 120 units to ensure high service level and account for potential variance, while being mindful that holding costs are high ($1/unit) relative to unit profit ($1/unit).",

To target an ending inventory that buffers for variance without incurring excessive holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I will aim for a total availability of roughly 120-130 units.
