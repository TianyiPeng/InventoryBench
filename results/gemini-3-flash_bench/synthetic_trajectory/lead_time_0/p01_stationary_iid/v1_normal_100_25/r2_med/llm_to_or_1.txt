Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or period-over-period arrivals to analyze. The initial demand history shows five samples: 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111. The mean of these samples is 89.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.0. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the demand we need to cover is for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the 'default' method for L to align with the promised 0 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' which calculates parameters based on all available historical demand samples (N=5), providing a stable initial baseline for the SKU. This approach ensures the inventory position targets a service level dictated by the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 105 units and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand for Period 1 was 89, which is close to the historical mean of 88.2. However, the last 5 samples (including the just-revealed P1 demand) show high variance: [100, 69, 92, 77, 111, 89]. With 16 units currently on hand and a lead time of 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers Period 2 demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent volatility while keeping the lead time at its default (0).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for Period 1 was 89 and Period 2 was 98. Combined with historical samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111), the mean demand across all 7 available data points is approximately 90.86 with a standard deviation of 13.9. Since lead time is 0, the base stock should cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). Using 'default' for L (0) and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the full known profile. The goal is to set the base stock level to satisfy a service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (sold 103 vs demand 114), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (orders arrive same period). The historical demand for Periods 1-5 is [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], with a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.15. However, the 'Game History' demand data (89, 98, 114) suggests a slightly higher recent trend than the provided sample set. I will use the last 5 demand samples (including the current history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since L=0, the backend will treat the required stock as 1 period of demand. I'll use recent_N with N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the volatility observed in the recent stockout period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-4), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand samples are [100 (seed), 69 (seed), 92 (seed), 77 (seed), 111 (seed)] based on the user-provided list, whereas the game history shows actual realized demands of [89, 98, 114, 101]. Comparing these, the realized demand is slightly higher than the seeds. Calculations: The mean of the realized demand over 4 periods is (89+98+114+101)/4 = 100.5. Standard deviation is approximately 10.3. Since there's no clear seasonal shift yet and demand is relatively stable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to weigh the actual game performance over the seeds, while keeping L at 'calculate' to verify the zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 89, 98, 114, 101, and 48. There is a significant drop in demand in Period 5 (48 units) compared to the previous average of approx 100. The current on-hand inventory is 62. The promised lead time is 0, and all previous orders (P1-P5) arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the demand drop in P5 is the first instance of a potential regime shift or outlier, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging the overall mean. For mu_hat, I'll use N=5 to include the recent drop but not overreact completely. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to account for the increased volatility caused by the P5 drop. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a sustained demand shift. Periods 1-4 averaged ~100.5 units, while Periods 5-6 dropped significantly (avg 55.5). Historical samples also show 48 and 63 recently. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory (Holding Cost $1), I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize recent data (N=3) to capture this downward trend. On-hand inventory is 49, which is nearly enough for one period's demand at the new lower rate, so the OR backend should order conservatively to reach a lower base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean decreased from ~100 to ~55 units (-45%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 5. Prior to Period 5, the average demand was approximately 100.6 units per period (Periods 1-4). From Period 5 to Period 7, the demand has dropped to an average of 55 units (48, 63, 54). This shift is sustained for 3 periods, justifying the use of recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by histories of Periods 1 through 7, so L is set to calculated. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, which is close to the expected demand of 55; the OR engine will determine the optimal replenishment based on these parameters to maintain the desired service level (q=0.8) while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1 to P8 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-4 averaged ~100.5 per period, while Periods 5-8 show a shift, although Period 8 specifically saw a sudden spike back to 104 after three lower periods (48, 63, 54). However, the overall demand trend since Period 5 remains lower than the initial phase. Period 8's high demand (104) resulted in a stockout because the starting inventory plus arrival (62 units) was insufficient. Given this volatility (48, 63, 54, 104), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new regime's mean and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' leverages the stable historical 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, the historical data shows two distinct demand regimes. Periods 1-4 exhibited high demand (mean ~100), while Period 5 began a lower demand regime (P5: 48, P6: 63, P7: 54, P9: 52), punctuated by a single outlier spike in Period 8 (demand 104). Given the carry-over insight and the fact that 4 out of the last 5 periods align with the lower mean (~54), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat. This balances the recent outlier with the lower trend. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will stick with the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to capture the volatility introduced by the Period 8 spike, ensuring the safety stock can buffer against such fluctuations without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern shows a clear split: Periods 1-4 averaged ~100 units, while Periods 5-10 showed a regime shift. Although the Carry-Over Insight mentioned a decrease to ~55, recent periods (P8 and P10) show spikes back into the 80-100+ range, suggesting high volatility or a potential recovery. Specifically, demand in P8 was 104 and P10 was 83. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is only 1 unit and the recent demand has been unpredictable (mean of last 6 periods is (48+63+54+104+52+83)/6 = 67.3), I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture the new mean while acknowledging the recent high-demand spikes. setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent regime will help maintain a high enough base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P3 and P8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory ended at 0 with 9 lost sales (demand 95, sold 86). Looking at the demand history since the previously identified 'regime shift' at Period 5, the demand has been: 48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95. The mean of these 7 samples is 71.3. However, the last four periods (P8-P11) show demands of 104, 52, 83, 95, which averages to 83.5. This suggests the demand has rebounded higher than the 'low' regime noted in the carry-over. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. To capture this recovery in demand and prevent stockouts seen in P8 and P11, I will use recent_N (N=4) to weight the most recent higher demand samples more heavily, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * mu is sufficient to cover this trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery noted from Period 8: mean increased from ~55 to ~83 units (+50%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand history shows significant volatility. A previously identified regime shift at Period 5 saw mean demand drop to ~55, followed by a recovery from Period 8 onward. Looking at the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand values are 104, 52, 83, 95, and 62, averaging approx 79.2 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this more recent, higher-demand regime while budgeting for the high local variance observed in this span. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for roughly (1+0) periods of demand plus a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility since Period 5, initially dropping but subsequently rebounding. Since Period 8, demand has stabilized into a higher-mean regime compared to the Period 5-7 slump. Specifically, demand from Period 8 to Period 13 was 104, 52, 83, 95, 62, and 69, averaging approximately 77.5 units per period. The recent 3-period average (P11-P13) is also approximately 75 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this 'recovery' regime (P8-P13). Standard deviation is also higher in this period, so sigma_hat will use the same recent window. On-hand inventory is 29, and historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment to meet demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility and several regime shifts. Periods 1-4 averaged ~100. Periods 5-7 dipped to ~55. Periods 8-14 show a recovery with an average demand of ~85.4, but individual periods fluctuate wildly (e.g., P14 reaching 128). The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Given the high demand in P14 (128) and the high stockout risk (ending inventory 0 in 3 of the last 7 periods), I will set mu_hat to capture the recent average of the recovery phase (N=7, covering Periods 8-14) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to satisfy demand spikes like the one seen in P14. Choosing N=7 for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility observed during this recovery phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a notable increase in volatility and mean compared to the previously identified low-regime. In the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 95, 62, 69, 128, and 107, averaging 92.2 units. This indicates the 'recovery' mentioned in Carry-over Insights (Period 12) has fully materialized and stabilized at a higher level, potentially returning to the levels seen in Periods 1-4. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. For demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this heightened demand and volatility regime while discounting the mid-game dip (P5-P10). This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current upward trend and risk of stockouts, which have occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: mean increased from ~83 to ~92 (+11%) over Periods 11-15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after several shifts. Starting from Period 11, the demand sequence is 95, 62, 69, 128, 107, 80. The mean of these last 6 periods is approximately 90.1 units. The period 16 carry-over insight noted a stabilization at ~92 units. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current regime (Periods 11-16). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order since Period 1 arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, L=0 (default) is appropriate. Since the critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (z* \u2248 0.84), the target base stock will be roughly 90 + 0.84 * std(last 6 periods). With 36 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR backend will order approximately 55-60 units to meet demand plus safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after several regime shifts. The most recent period (P17) showed demand of 77 units, following a peak of 128 in P14 and 107 in P15. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the mean demand is approximately 88.4 units. Since Period 11, the demand has consistently stayed within a range that suggests a new, higher stability compared to the dip observed in Periods 5-7. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current regime (Periods 11-17), while also using recent_N with N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (which includes the high of 128 and low of 62). Lead time is consistently 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so I will maintain the default lead time parameter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown several shifts, most recently stabilizing at a higher level since Period 15. The demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) has been 128, 107, 80, 77, and 104, averaging 99.2 units per period. The on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) with no in-transit units. Given the promised and actual lead time is consistently 0, I need to set parameters that cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~100 units) which is higher than the long-term historical mean. This N=5 captures the regime shift noted around Period 16 and the higher volatility seen in recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: demand stabilized at a higher level with a mean of approximately 100 units (confirmed over Periods 14-18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units since Period 15. Specifically, demand values for Periods 15-19 were 107, 80, 77, 104, and 86. While the last period (86) was slightly lower than the average, the overall trend supports a regime centered around 100. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 15-19) to align the OR backend with the most recent demand regime (mean ~91, but reflecting the volatility within this window). This balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a base stock that accounts for current demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant spike in Period 20 reaching 141 units, confirming the upward trend noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 19 insight suggests a mean of 100, but recent samples are P18: 104, P19: 86, P20: 141). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is approximately 99 units. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to ensure the order covers the expected demand for Period 21. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility, higher-mean regime effectively without over-relying on the older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: mean demand for Periods 15-20 is 99 units, with a notable spike to 141 units in Period 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after a regime shift observed around Period 15. The mean demand for the last seven periods (Period 15-21) is 100.28 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.9. Specifically, the last three periods (Period 19, 20, 21) had demands of 86, 141, and 102 respectively. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 18 units with no in-transit units. Given the high criticality (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a slightly aggressive service level is maintained by the OR backend. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current stable demand regime while including the recent volatility (spike in P20). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect this variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 15 with a mean of ~100 units; significant volatility noted (Period 20 demand spiked to 141).

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15 and has remained elevated. Over the last 8 periods (Period 15-22), the average demand is 98.25 units, which is consistent with the previously identified '100 unit' regime. While Period 20 saw a significant spike to 141 (causing a stockout), the demand in Period 22 returned to 86, suggesting that while volatility is present, the mean remains stable. Since Period 15, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I will use N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the Period 20 spike. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 100-unit average plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 15-23) shows a mean of approximately 98 units, with significant volatility (std dev ~22). Period 23 saw a lower demand of 70 units, following a period of 86, suggesting a possible regression to the mean or a slight cooling from the earlier peak. I will use a recent window of N=9 (from Period 15 to 23) to capture the current regime's characteristics. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent 9-period window ensures the OR backend captures the higher average demand and elevated volatility compared to the early game history (Periods 5-14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 15. Although recent periods (22-24) showed a slight dip followed by a bounce back to 113, the regime established at Period 15 (mean ~100) remains the most reliable anchor for decision-making. Period 24 concluded with 0 units on-hand after meeting a demand of 113, meaning there is no safety buffer for Period 25. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the performance of the current regime (Periods 15-24) while filtering out the older, lower-demand data. This N choice captures the high-demand volatility (range 70-141) seen in this block, ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock for the current period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 99 units over the last 11 periods (P15-P25). Despite some fluctuations (ranging from 70 to 141), 100 units remains a solid mean estimate for forecasting. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 11), following a period where demand (104) nearly cleared out the available stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the statistics of this current stable high-demand regime (Periods 15-25), which balances the need for responsiveness to the current level while smoothing out the volatility observed since Period 20.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 15-26) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 97 units, with occasional spikes (e.g., 141 in Period 20). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the demand since Period 15, I will use recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 15 through 26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current elevated demand level compared to earlier periods while accounting for the moderate volatility observed recently. The On-hand inventory is currently low (16 units), and there are no units in transit. Using these parameters will ensure the base stock policy maintains enough inventory to cover the anticipated mean demand of ~97 units plus a safety buffer.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 99 units. Recent demand samples (Periods 21-27) are [102, 86, 70, 113, 104, 99, 104], which yields an average of 96.8. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering Periods 15 to 27) to capture this stable yet volatile period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages, so L is set to default. The current on-hand inventory is 10, meaning a significant order is required to meet the high service level (q = 0.8) and cover the expected demand occurring after this decision phase. Using a longer lookback window (N=13) helps smooth the volatility observed in earlier periods while respecting the established regime shift.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units since Period 15. Although there was a spike in Period 20 (141 units) and a slight dip in the most recent period (81 units), the overall behavior remains consistent with the established regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 28 conclude' message (ordered P28, arrived P28). I will continue using a recent window of 14 periods (P15 to P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable mean of ~100 while accounting for the observed volatility (standard deviation ~17). This ensures the base stock calculation properly balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1) to maintain high service levels during this stable but slightly volatile phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and significant occasional spikes (e.g., 141 units in Period 20, 138 units in Period 29). The current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 29. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive in the same period to meet current demand. To ensure high service levels and account for the observed volatility (standard deviation ~20 in the current regime), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 15 periods (since the last major regime shift at Period 15) to capture the current mean and variability accurately. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the next period, mitigating stockout risk during demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains consistently elevated since Period 15: mean demand for Periods 15-29 is 101.5 units, with periodic spikes above 135 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Although Period 30 saw a lower demand (65), recent lead times remain consistently at 0 periods. Based on the Carry-over Insights, I will maintain the forecast around the established mean of 100. I am using recent_N with N=16 to cover the entire stable regime from Period 15 to Period 30. This N value captures the current mean (approx 100.5) and the volatility (periodic spikes and drops) to ensure the base stock levels defined by the OR engine are appropriate for the service level requirements (high profit/holding cost ratio).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but volatile regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (Period 26-31) show demand values of 99, 104, 81, 138, 65, and 85, which aligns with this ongoing pattern of high variance around a century mean. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To set efficient OR parameters, I will use a window of the last 17 periods (Period 15 to 31) to capture this specific regime's mean and standard deviation. This N=17 window ensures the backend calculates mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current high-demand state rather than the lower-demand periods seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently 31, and with L=0, the order arriving this period will need to satisfy Period 32 demand together with this stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and significant volatility. Recently, demand in Period 29 (138), Period 31 (85), and Period 32 (116) continues this pattern of high variability around a mean slightly above 100. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=18 to capture the stable but volatile regime established since Period 15. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer appropriate for the observed variance, minimizing the risk of stockouts (as seen in Period 32) while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $459.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained relatively stable since Period 15, with a mean demand around 100 units and moderate volatility. Recent demand for Period 32 and 33 were 116 and 115 respectively, indicating the regime is still active. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the stable but volatile demand, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering Periods 15 to 33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics. This period starts with only 1 unit on hand, so a robust order based on the current mean and variance is necessary to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at an elevated level since Period 15, with an average of approximately 100 units per period. Recent performance (Periods 30-34) shows an average demand of 91.4 units, though this is impacted by recent volatility (range 65-116). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching back to Period 1. Since the product is chips with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime established around Period 15 while allowing the backend to account for the observed volatility in the most recent 20 periods, ensuring we maintain enough on-hand inventory to handle the frequent demand spikes above 110 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has maintained a stable but volatile regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has been 85, 116, 115, 76, and 114, averaging 101.2 units per period. The on-hand inventory is very low at 2 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since no new regime shift or seasonal pattern is evident in the data, I will continue using recent_N (N=20) for demand and standard deviation to capture the established 'high-demand' phase (starting around Period 15) while smoothing out the periodic spikes (e.g., 114-116 units). This keeps the service level high given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently elevated around a mean of 100 units since Period 15. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is 98.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to hold reliably based on all historical 'conclude' messages. Our current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Setting L=0 (default) and using the recent 20 periods (since the regime stabilization around P15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable forecast that accounts for both the mean and the observed volatility (max demand 141, min 65 in this regime). This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 100-unit average plus a safety buffer for spikes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 15, with occasional high-volatility spikes (e.g., 119 in P37, 138 in P29, 141 in P20). Actual lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, which simplifies inventory management. Current on-hand inventory is 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) to capture the stable demand mean and variance since the Period 15 regime shift. This N covers the extended stable period while allowing for the observed volatility to influence the safety stock (sigma_hat), ensuring a high service level against the periodic demand spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in an elevated regime since Period 15, with a base level around 100 units but significant volatility. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 30 to 38 is approximately 95.7 units (varying from 49 to 119). Recently, we saw a sharp drop in demand to 49 units in Period 38, resulting in a higher-than-usual ending inventory of 69 units. However, looking at the broader history, demand usually rebounds after such dips. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated regime while smoothing out the high volatility (spikes and dips) observed since Period 15. This N covers the stable period since the last major confirmed shift, allowing the OR backend to balance the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but volatile regime since approximately Period 15, with a mean demand around 100 units. Recent demand (Periods 35-39) shows fluctuations (114, 90, 119, 49, 84), maintaining this general average despite a significant dip in Period 38. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which is confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To set OR parameters, I am using L=0 (explicitly confirmed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current volatility and mean of the stabilized high-demand regime while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for the observed variance. Inventory is currently at 34 units with 0 in transit, so the OR engine will order the difference between the base stock (calculated from mu_hat and sigma_hat) and the 34 units on hand.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (30-40) show continued volatility (range 49 to 119) but maintain an average near 95. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) and there is no in-transit inventory, the OR engine needs to place a replenishment order for Period 41. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period 21, and use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the zero-day lead time history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable, elevated regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units (mean of Periods 15-41 is 100.1). Although there is some volatility (e.g., Period 38 demand dropped to 49, Period 29 spiked to 138), the long-term average is very consistent. Period 41 demand was 101, perfectly aligning with this mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history. I am setting L to 'default' (0) as it is reliable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=26 (covering the stable period from Period 15 to Period 41) to capture the current regime's mean and variance precisely, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 100 units of demand per period while accounting for the observed volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has maintained its elevated regime since approximately Period 15, with a mean demand of roughly 100 units. Recent demand (Periods 38-42: 49, 84, 108, 101, 113) shows some volatility but averages to 91 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N and are visible in the Period N conclude message), the system requires enough inventory to cover the demand occurring right after the decision. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current mean (approx 96) and variance, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the most recent demand behavior while ignoring the older low-demand periods. This provides a balance between meeting the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio and avoiding overstocking during minor dips.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, albeit volatile, regime since approximately Period 15, with a mean demand of roughly 100 units. Recent periods (P40-P43) have shown demands of 108, 101, 113, and 77, maintaining this average. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, as confirmed by the continuous 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 39 units and a review+lead period of 1 (L=0), I need to ensure the base stock covers approximately 100+ units. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime starting from P24 onwards, which provides a robust statistical sample of the current behavior. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost effectively.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, elevated regime since approximately Period 15, with a mean demand around 100 units. A review of the most recent 10-period window (Periods 35-44) shows a mean demand of 92.2 units, though individual periods fluctuate between 49 and 119. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently met, with every order since inception arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, q=0.8), the OR backend's inventory strategy should prioritize service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained behavior of the current regime since Period 15 while allowing for recent variability. Lead time L will remain at 'default' (0).

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, high-volume regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent demand (Periods 41-45) shows: 101, 113, 77, 78, 99 (avg = 93.6), which aligns with the overall mean of 100. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 46 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet the immediate current and next period's demand without overstocking and incurring excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 15. Given lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period. I will use a N=15 lookback for demand statistics to capture the established regime's mean and volatility while dampening the impact of the very high spikes observed earlier. The profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level (~0.80), which the base stock policy will naturally target.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, albeit volatile, regime since approximately Period 15, with a mean demand around 100 units. Recent periods (P40-P46) show demand values of 108, 101, 113, 77, 78, 99, and 128. The mean of these last 7 periods is approximately 100.5, confirming the long-term Carry-Over Insight. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival), as evidenced by every 'conclude' message in history. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to high demand (128) in P46, the 0-day lead time allows for immediate replenishment. I will continue using recent_N (N=20) for demand parameters to capture the sustained mean of ~100 while accounting for the observed volatility (sigma).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently elevated since Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (40-47) show a mean demand of 100.75 units (108, 101, 113, 77, 78, 99, 128, 102), confirming this stability. Although Period 46 saw a minor stockout, the inventory was immediately replenished by the Period 47 order because the actual lead time is 0 periods. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), I am using a recent window (N=15) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately for the base-stock calculation. This window covers the stable period identified since Period 30. The parameters L=0, mu_hat (recent_N=15), and sigma_hat (recent_N=15) allow the OR backend to maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while being responsive to the observed variance in the current regime.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=100, arrived=100 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=115, demand=107, sold=107, ending on-hand inventory=8
Daily Profit: $428.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, elevated regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent demand (Periods 44-48) shows values of 78, 99, 128, 102, and 107, yielding an average of 102.8 units per period, which aligns with the established long-term average. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is high (80%), requiring sufficient inventory to cover demand spikes (like the 128 units seen in Period 46). I will use a window of 20 periods (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out localized noise. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, elevated regime since Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P46-P49) show higher volatility with demands of 128, 102, 107, and 144 respectively (mean of 120 over the last 4 periods). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high criticality of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), and the current 0 on-hand inventory following a demand spike of 144, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current mean and variance accurately while slightly favoring the recent higher demand trend. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 100-110 units of demand for Period 50 while accounting for the high observed standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Periods 46-49 (avg 120 vs long-term regime avg 100). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.
