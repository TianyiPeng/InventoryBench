The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with consistent demand. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. To satisfy the immediate demand for Period 1 and minimize the risk of stockouts while accounting for the average demand of 90 units and a small safety stock buffer (considering the max historical of 111), I will place an order for 115 units.
