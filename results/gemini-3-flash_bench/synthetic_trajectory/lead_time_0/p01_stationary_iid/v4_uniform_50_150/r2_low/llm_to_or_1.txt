Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (1/(1+1)), suggesting we target the median demand. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand across the first 5 periods (which are provided in the context as 130, 88, 64, 58, 129) averages 93.8 with a standard deviation of 34.9. Since this is the first decision period and we have a 5-period sample, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the baseline demand statistics provided. No shipments are in transit or on hand yet. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on these parameters to satisfy Period 1 demand (which happens after this decision).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 94 units and sold 94, ending with 0 inventory and a lost sale of 1 unit. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129. The mean of these 5 samples is 93.8. Since on-hand is currently 0 and we are at the start of Period 2, I will set mu_hat based on the mean of all available historical samples to cover the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period). sigma_hat will also use the default calculation to account for the observed volatility in the initial demand data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five sample periods (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) shows a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. In the first two game periods, demand was 95 and 71. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the median demand. I will use all available historical demand samples to set the parameters, as no clear regime shift is yet established by the first two game results (95 and 71) compared to the provided pre-game history (130, 88, 64, 58, 129).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand patterns show high volatility: P1: 95, P2: 71, P3: 136. Note that historical demand samples provided in the prompt (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) differ slightly from the GAME HISTORY demand. Using GAME HISTORY as the primary source: average demand is ~101 with a standard deviation of ~33. In P3, we stocked out (sold 91, demand 136), ending with 0 on-hand. Since L=0, the order arrives within the period to meet that period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-volatility mean and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1) where q=0.5 (z=0), aiming to cover the mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 42 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The history confirms a promised lead time of 0 is being met consistently (L=0). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (note: Period 5 demand is provided in the header, while earlier periods are in history). There is significant volatility (std dev ~35) and no clear seasonal pattern yet, though demand spiked back up in Period 5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level (0.50) suggests we should avoid overstocking. I will use the average of the last 5 samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent spread while keeping L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-5 confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units. Historical demand across the first 5 periods is: 95, 71, 136, 59, 59. While there was a spike in Period 3 (136), the last two periods have stabilized at 59. However, the overall mean (84) and standard deviation (~33) suggest a base stock calculation is needed to avoid the stockouts observed in Period 1 and Period 3. Since P1-P5 show high volatility, I will use all 5 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we have enough buffer for potential spikes, while L remains at the confirmed 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a highly stable lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Demand for chips(Regular) has been somewhat volatile but consistently averages around 82.6 units over the first six periods. Period 1: 95, P2: 71, P3: 136, P4: 59, P5: 59, P6: 76. No clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift is evident yet. Given the high volatility (standard deviation ~28), I will use the mean of all available history (6 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced baseline for the OR engine to determine the base-stock level while accounting for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, which implies a service level target of 50%. Since on-hand is low (8 units) and lead time is zero, the engine will likely place an order to bridge the gap to the target base stock and the current period's expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand spiked to 144 units, resulting in a stockout with only 83 units sold. This follows a volatile pattern where demand fluctuated significantly over the first 7 periods (95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144). Average demand is approximately 91.4 units, but the high variance (std ~36) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1, q=0.5) suggest a critical need for safety stock. The lead time consistently confirms at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while smoothing the average. Since lead time is 0, (1+L) equals 1, meaning we are effectively forecasting for a single period of coverage. The goal is to set a base stock that prevents stockouts from these frequent 130+ unit demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after two consecutive periods (7 and 8) where demand (144 and 147) significantly exceeded the available inventory, leading to stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistent with historical arrivals (all orders from Periods 1-8 arrived in the same period). Based on the 8 periods of demand data (95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144, 147), there is a clear upward shift in demand starting from Period 7. The average demand for the first 6 periods was ~82.7, while the last two periods averaged 145.5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend (with q=0.5) will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent spike in demand (averaging ~122.3) while smoothing slightly for the volatility. L is set to default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use N=8 to consider the full volatility profile while adapting to the recent higher levels, ensuring we order enough to recover from the current zero-stock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 7: average demand increased from ~83 to ~145 (+75%) across two consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting at Period 7. While Period 9 demand (76) was lower than the peaks in Periods 7 and 8 (144, 147), the running average over the last three periods (Periods 7-9) is approximately 122, which is notably higher than the initial average of 83. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true across all concluded periods. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-mean regime without being overly skewed by the early low-demand data, ensuring we stock enough for the potential high demand while remaining sensitive to recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a volatile pattern. A regime shift was previously identified at Period 7 (averaging ~145 units), but Periods 9 and 10 showed a significant drop to 76 and 71 units respectively, returning closer to the initial mean. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which minimizes expected total cost by aiming for the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units with zero in-transit. Based on the historical demand samples (Periods 1-10: 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144, 147, 76, 71), the most recent 4 periods (P7-P10) average 109.5 units, which captures the recent high peak and the subsequent drop. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent volatility while the lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are evaluating 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 11 concluded periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I observe a significant demand shift: Periods 1-6 had an average demand of ~83, while Periods 7-8 saw a spike to ~145. However, since Period 9, demand has cooled significantly, averaging ~66 over the last three periods (76, 71, 52). This suggests the high-demand regime noted in previous insights was temporary. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, overstocking is expensive. I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the end of the peak and the recent drop) to capture the current lower demand trend while maintaining a small buffer for residual volatility, preventing excessive inventory buildup.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels after Period 8 peak: avg demand dropped from ~145 (P7-8) to ~66 (P9-11). The previous high-demand insight from P9 is no longer sustained.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a volatile period (P7-P8 spike). Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been 76, 71, 52, and 73, yielding a mean of 68. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median/mean demand to minimize total costs. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while excluding the high-demand outliers from Periods 7 and 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P9-P12): average demand is 68 units, significantly down from the P7-P8 peak of 145. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 9 to Period 13) has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 66.2 units and a standard deviation of 10.3 units. This follows a peak in Periods 7 and 8. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level q = 0.5 (z* = 0), meaning the base stock level will target the mean demand. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this stable regime (P9-P13), which ensures the inventory policy reflects the current demand levels rather than the historical volatility of the P7-P8 peak. On-hand inventory is 9, and there are no units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand spiked to 125, which is a significant increase from the previous 5-period average (P9-P13) of approximately 66 units. At Period 15 START, we are at 0 on-hand inventory with 0 in-transit, meaning we failed to satisfy the full demand in Period 14. This spike (125) mirrors the high demand seen in P7-P8 (~145), suggesting a potential return to a higher demand regime or a periodic fluctuation. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle this volatility while maintaining a balanced service level (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 results in a 50% target service level in the base-stock formula), I will use the recent_N method. I'll set N=4 to capture the most recent spike (P14) and the preceding stable period (P11-P13) to avoid over-reacting to a single point while still increasing the base stock to cover potential sustained higher demand. mu_hat and sigma_hat will both use N=4 to reflect this recent change in both mean and variance.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 102 units, following a sharp spike to 125 units in Period 14. This indicates a departure from the previous stable low-demand regime (avg ~68) identified in Period 13. Over the last two periods (P14-P15), the average demand has shifted to 113.5 units. The system ended Period 15 with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, having stocked out in both Period 14 and Period 15. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent upward shift while balancing the historical lower demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 11-15: 52, 73, 59, 125, 102), which yields an average of 82.2 units per period. This sets a base stock that is responsive to the recent volatility without overreacting to the single highest peak.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected starting Period 14: average demand increased from ~68 to ~113.5 (+67%) over the last two periods, ending the stable low-demand period noted at P13.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown recent volatility. A potential upward shift was noted in Carry-over Insights at Period 16 (Periods 14-15 avg ~113.5), but Period 16 demand dropped back to 68. Over the last 3 periods (P14-P16), the average demand is 98.33. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the unit profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand to minimize total costs. Using a 3-period window (recent_N=3) captures the current elevated mean from the P14-16 cluster while acknowledging the P16 dip. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is 15 units, and lead time L=0 is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased (P14-P16): mean demand ~98 units with high variance (range 68-125), following a stable low regime (P9-P13 avg 66).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 122 units, causing a stockout as we only had 99 units on hand. Analysis of the recent regime (Period 14 to Period 17) shows a mean demand of 104.25 units with significant volatility (68 to 125). This confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights, where demand moved from a low-stable period (avg ~66) to a higher, more volatile state. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adequately capture this new higher-demand regime while accounting for the recent stockouts, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR engine to react to the increased mean (104.25) and higher variance observed in this specific window, aiming to prevent further stockouts despite the high holding cost ratio (50/50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from P14-P17 confirmed: mean demand increased to 104.25 (+58% from previous stable average of 66), with notably higher volatility (std dev ~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 14. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand is 103.6 units, compared to the previously stabilized mean of ~66 units (P9-P13). Period 18 saw a demand of 101, which is consistent with this higher regime. On-hand inventory is very low at 4 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0 (50/50 split for base stock calculation), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. However, to account for the sustained higher demand and prevents stockouts seen in Periods 14, 15, and 17, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the current higher-demand regime (P14-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new regime since Period 14, characterized by higher mean and significantly increased volatility compared to the P9-P13 period. Over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), demand has averaged 95.8 units with a range of 57 to 125. The most recent demand (P19) was 57, which is a dip, but given the high volatility established since P14, I will maintain a sample size (N=6) that captures this entire current regime to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed variance. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by every 'conclude' message in the history. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). The OR backend's use of sigma_hat will ensure we carry enough safety stock to handle the return of higher demand spikes within this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P14-P19: Mean demand is approximately 96 units (+45% vs P9-P13) with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~27).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the demand regime shift identified at Period 14, the last 7 periods (P14-P20) show a mean demand of approximately 103.3 with a standard deviation of 31.8. This is significantly higher and more volatile than the preceding period (P9-P13, avg 66). Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a demand spike (148 units). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). With an actual lead time of 0 periods consistently observed in history, I will set L=0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the higher mean of the current regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation ~32 vs previous ~10).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P14-P20) is confirmed with a mean of 103.3 and higher volatility (Std Dev ~32), compared to the P9-P13 average of 66. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime that started at Period 14. Over the last 8 periods (P14-P21), demand has averaged approximately 98.5 units, though it exhibits significant volatility (standard deviation ~31.4). In Period 22, we are starting with 39 units on-hand. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile q = 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default (0).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 14 (P14-P22) remains the most relevant for current decision-making. Over this 9-period stretch, the mean demand is ~100.0 with a standard deviation of ~30.9. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. The ending inventory in Period 22 was 0, meaning on-hand starting Period 23 is 0. With profit equal to holding cost ($1.0 each), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (mu_hat). I will use recent_N=9 to capture this entire current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P14 continues to show stability around a mean of ~100 with high volatility (Std Dev ~31).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in the regime that started at Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the mean demand is approximately 95.3 with a standard deviation of approximately 32.1. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (since arrival is 0, L+1 = 1 period). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which means the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use N=10 to capture this current regime's statistics precisely. Currently, on-hand is 47, which is below the expected mean of ~95, so an order should be triggered to reach the base stock level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 14 remains active. For Periods 14-24, the mean demand is 100.27 units (125, 102, 68, 122, 101, 57, 148, 65, 112, 53, 92) with a standard deviation of 30.5. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime. Since profit and holding cost are both $1.0/unit, the critical ratio q is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median of the demand distribution (z*=0). This approach balances the risk of stockouts against high holding costs in a high-volatility environment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has confirmed a higher mean (~100) compared to the Period 9-13 baseline (~66), but with significant volatility (standard deviation ~31). The specific lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all concluding messages. For Period 26, the demand forecast should account for this persistent regime. I am utilizing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full current regime (P14-P25) which currently averages 95.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 31.7. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, but the high volatility suggests maintaining a robust base stock to avoid the stockouts observed in Periods 14, 15, 17, 20, and 22. Choosing N=12 precisely targets the current stable yet volatile regime beginning at Period 14.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing chips(Regular). The historical data shows a demand regime that shifted around Period 14 and has since remained relatively stable, though volatile. Over the last 13 periods (P14-P26), the mean demand is 92.5 units with a standard deviation of 29.5. The most recent demand (P26) was 90, consistent with this regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) in the base stock formula. However, since the OR backend uses a capped policy that factors in a higher 95th percentile for safety, setting accurate mean and variance parameters is crucial. I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering the entire current stable regime from P14 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out period-to-period noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues within the regime that started around Period 14. Over the last 14 periods (P14-P27), the mean demand is approximately 96.6 units with a standard deviation of 28.5. The most recent demand (P27) was 119, causing a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 27 conclude'. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the base stock should align closely with the mean of the current regime. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific volatility and mean since the last major regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 14 has continued through Period 28. In the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28), the average demand is 84.6 units (92, 63, 90, 119, 59), which is slightly lower than the overall regime average (~96) but maintains the characteristic volatility (standard deviation ~23 in this window). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will aim to set the base stock close to the mean demand. Using N=15 for mu_hat capturing the entire stable period since P14 to provide a reliable mean for the current regime, while using N=15 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this period compared to the earlier quiet phase (P9-P13). On-hand inventory is currently 36 units with no units in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 14 to Period 29 shows a sustained regime with a mean of approximately 94.2 units and a standard deviation of 29.8. This regime is notably more volatile and higher in volume than the P9-P13 period. Looking at the last five periods (P25-P29: 63, 90, 119, 59, 124), the mean is 91 and the standard deviation remains high. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To maximize reward given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock level should target the mean of the current regime while accounting for the high volatility that often leads to stockouts (as seen in P27 and P29). I will use the recent 16 periods (P14-P29) as the stable regime length to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P14 remains stable through P29 with a mean of ~94 and high volatility (Std Dev ~30). Lead time is verified at 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 14 has remained relatively stable through Period 30. Analyzing the demand from Period 14 to Period 30 (17 samples), the mean is approximately 95.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 29.8. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand (P27-P30: 119, 59, 124, 121) remains volatile but centered around this regime mean. I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture this specific regime's behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period arrival history. This strategy balances the high stockout risk seen in recent periods (P27, P29, P30 all hit zero inventory) while acknowledging the high holding cost ($1.0).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has remained relatively stable but exhibits high volatility. Recent demand (P29-P31) has been consistently high (124, 121, 111), resulting in stockouts. The mean demand for the entire P14-P31 regime (18 samples) is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of about 29. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, which implies the base stock should target the median demand (approximated by the mean if symmetric). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better capture the persistent high demand and high volatility that has led to recent stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (the length of the current regime starting from P14).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31: 111, P32: 109) continues the stable regime identified starting at Period 14, but at the higher end of that range. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed through P32). I will continue using the recent_N method with N=19 (covering the regime from P14 to P32) to capture the current mean of ~96 and the high standard deviation (~30) characteristic of this regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to account for the frequent demand spikes above 110 units while considering the high holding cost and 50% critical ratio (Profit $1 / Total $2), which normally targets the median demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 14, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 94 units and high volatility. Recent periods (P30-P33) show demand levels of 121, 111, 109, and 89, reinforcing this pattern. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are used to satisfy demand in Period N). Based on the carry-over insight from Period 30 and the recent 20-period data (P14-P33), I am using L=0 and calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture this regime's characteristics. This approach balances the need to cover the current high-volatility demand while minimizing holding costs in a same-day arrival environment.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 14, characterized by a mean of approximately 93-94 units and a standard deviation of about 30 units. Recent periods (P30-P34) show demand values of 121, 111, 109, 89, and 79, which align with this established mean but suggest a slight downward trend or just typical variance. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. With on-hand inventory at 18 units and a profit-to-cost ratio suggesting a high service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, though the backend policy uses this to balance stock), I will continue using the recent_N method based on the regime starting at P14. This N=21 (P14 to P34) captures the full current regime's behavior. The OR backend's inventory policy will manage the trade-off based on the (L+1) period demand coverage.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but volatile regime since Period 14. In the most recent block (P30-P35), the average demand is approximately 102.5 units (121, 111, 109, 89, 79, 106). The volatility remains significant, with a standard deviation around 15-20 in this recent subset, although the long-term regime (since P14) shows a higher standard deviation of ~30. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 35's demand exceeded starting inventory. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current mean and the historical volatility accurately, I will use a N=10 for mu_hat to cover the most recent stable trend, and N=22 (all data since P14) for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility. The critical service level target (based on $1 profit/$1 holding cost) is 50%, but the OR backend's inventory cap uses a 95th percentile, which helps prevent overstocking while covering the mean.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 14 continues to be the most relevant, but there has been a recent increase in both the mean and the volatility of demand over the last several periods (Period 30-36). The average demand over these last 7 periods is approximately 108 units, compared to the overall regime average of ~94 units observed through Period 29. Specifically, the latest demand observed in Period 36 was 142 units, which is the second-highest recorded in the history. To prevent stockouts (which occurred in Period 35 and 36 due to demand exceeding on-hand inventory), I am increasing N to 23 to capture the full behavior of the current regime (from Period 14 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock reflects the higher variance and the slightly elevated mean. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P14 shows an uptick in mean demand (avg ~108) and volatility over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) compared to the previous P14-P29 average (~94).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P30-P37) shows an average demand of 103.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.5. This represents an uptick from the earlier P14-P29 period (mean ~94). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this shift while maintaining stability against individual period noise (like P37's lower demand of 67), I am setting recent_N to 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This aligns the OR backend with the current demand trend observed since Period 30, supporting a stock level that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized with a mean around 95-100, but recent periods (P30-P38) show increased volatility and a slightly higher average (~103). Specifically, Period 38 demand was 114, following a lower 67 in P37 and a high 142 in P36. The inventory currently stands at 0 after demand exceeded supply in P38. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the higher recent mean and the fact that we ended with 0 on-hand inventory, I will focus on the most recent 9 periods (P30-P38) to capture the current volatility and mean shift (Mean ~104, Std Dev ~25). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 will provide the OR backend with the necessary parameters to cushion against the frequent stockouts observed in the history while accounting for the high holding cost (Ratio of Profit to Holding Cost is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P30-P38: Mean demand has shifted upwards to ~104 with sustained high volatility (Std Dev ~25), compared to the P14-P29 average of ~94. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher regime since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units (P30-P39) compared to the prior long-term average. Volatility remains high, with a standard deviation of approximately 25. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the expected demand for the (L+1) period (which is 1 period here). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable higher demand regime (P30-P39). L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has shown a slight upward shift in mean and sustained high volatility compared to the earlier P14-P29 period. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the mean demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of about 25. The most recent observation (P40) showed demand of 131, resulting in current stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods as verified by continuous 'Period X conclude' messages where the order placed in Period N arrives during the same Period N. To capture the current demand level and account for the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to cover this most recent stable regime (starting P30). The OR backend uses a service level approach (profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5), and given the volatility, the inventory will naturally fluctuate around the mean demand to minimize costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-volatility regime since Period 30. Over the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand is approximately 100.6 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show a slightly higher variance with an average of approximately 90.2. However, focusing on the broader P30-P41 window (N=12) captures the current stability better. Lead time remains consistently at 0, as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. With an on-hand inventory of 40 units and a target based on the most recent regime, the parameters are set to maintain a high service level while accounting for the significant volatility observed (std dev ~26 over the recent window). The OR engine will compute the base stock using these recently observed statistics to balance the $1 profit against $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus safety buffer).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with the mean demand for Periods 30-42 being approximately 101.4 units. Although the most recent two periods (P41-P42) showed lower demand (64 and 51), the overall volatility in this regime remains high (Std Dev ~29). Lead time has been consistently 0 throughout the history. I will use the last 13 periods (N=13, covering P30-P42) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this most recent stable regime more accurately than the full history. This approach ensures enough inventory to cover the high volatility while acknowledging the current mean demand level. The on-hand inventory of 50 units will be subtracted from the base stock calculated by the OR backend.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a regime that started around Period 30, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 100 units and significant volatility. Recent demand in Periods 40-43 (131, 64, 51, 95) shows high variance, with the 4-period average being 85.25, while the Period 30-43 average is 96.7. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median/mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L = 1). I will use a recent window (N=14, from Period 30 to 43) to capture this current regime's mean and standard deviation for the OR backend, ensuring the stock level accounts for the observed volatility while targeting the 50% service level required by the cost structure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has fluctuated through several regimes, most recently stabilizing around a mean of approximately 104 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~25) from Period 30 onwards. Current history confirms the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (arrivals occur in the same period as the order). In Period 44, 95 units were ordered and arrived, meeting a demand of 94, leaving 3 units on-hand. Given the equal weight of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=15 (covering Periods 30-44) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing short-term noise. Current on-hand is 3, with 0 in-transit. Setting L to 0 consistently aligns with the observed data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P30 continues through P44 with a mean of ~98 and sustained high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the stable phase that began around Period 30. For the range P30-P45, mean demand is approximately 101.5 units (standard deviation ~26). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 0 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should align with the median demand. However, to mitigate stockout risk given recent high demand (123 in P45), I am using N=16 (P30-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean while ensuring the OR engine has enough samples to normalize. Setting L to 0 based on consistent history.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 30, characterized by a mean of approximately 98 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation around 28-30). Recent demand in Period 46 was 64, following 123 in Period 45, which is consistent with this high-variance regime. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 35 units, with no units in transit. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 30 to 46) to capture this most recent stable regime and its volatility. Lead time 'L' will remain at the 'default' promised value of 0, as confirmed by all historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has been stable with a mean of approximately 98 and high volatility (Std Dev ~25). Reviewing the most recent results (P41-P47), demand has fluctuated significantly (64, 51, 95, 94, 123, 64, 51). The average of these last 18 periods (P30-P47) is approximately 97.4. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward the median. I will use a recent_N of 18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established regime's average and its high variance, ensuring sufficient coverage for the remaining 3 periods of the game without excessive overstocking.

Daily Profit: $94.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 30 continues to show a mean of approximately 95-100 units with significant volatility (Std Dev ~28). Recent demand in Period 48 was 107, following two lower demand periods (64 and 51), reinforcing the high-volatility nature of the current regime. As this is the penultimate period (49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 and Period 50 demand while minimizing leftover inventory at the end of Period 50. Since the lead time is consistently 0, an order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 49 demand immediately. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. To capture the full current regime and provide a stable forecast, I am using N=19 (Period 30 to Period 48). This covers the most recent stable phase identified in the carry-over insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable but volatile regime since approximately Period 30. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 to Period 49 shows an average demand (\u03bc) of approximately 98.4 units and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of approximately 27.8. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since we are at the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy the remaining demand while minimizing the ending inventory. On-hand inventory is currently 4 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture this stable regime (P30-P49), covering the 20 most recent samples. This will provide the OR backend with the relevant mean and volatility to calculate the final base stock for the current period.
