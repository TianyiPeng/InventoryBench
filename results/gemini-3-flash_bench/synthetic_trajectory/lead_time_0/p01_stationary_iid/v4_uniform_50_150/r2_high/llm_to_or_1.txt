Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (~95% service level). Promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5-period sample history provided (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), the mean demand is 93.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 35.8. Since this is the first decision period and no specific calendar context or product descriptions are yet available to suggest a trend or seasonality shift, I will use all available history to set the parameters. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover Period 1 demand (since L=0, we need to cover 1+L = 1 period).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. The demand was 95, leaving 56 units on-hand. Based on the provided historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) and the first actual game observation (95), the mean demand is roughly 94. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (all 5 historical + Period 1) targets a balanced forecast. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N to capture the observed variance in this early stage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1275.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 74 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 95 and 71 (average 83). The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages confirm the actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period). Based on the 5 initial demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), the mean demand is 93.8. Using all 5 samples provides a stable baseline for mu_hat. Given the target service level (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95), the base stock should cover the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all historical data available.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2580.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). The demand history for the first three periods shows values of 95, 71, and 136. Although the provided historical demand data shows different values (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), the game history specifically records demand as 95, 71, and 136 for Periods 1-3. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Since the lead time is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period (Period 4). The demand appears volatile but averages around 100 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand trend (average of 95, 71, 136 is approx 101) and set L to default (0). This will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock to replenish the inventory immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1025.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe demand data for 5 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (95, 71, 136, 59, 129). The mean of the last 5 demand samples is approximately 98 (rounding (130+88+64+58+129)/5 \u2248 93.8 according to provided samples, though historical conclude logs show slightly different realized demand values: 95, 71, 136, 59, and currently 129). Taking the most recent 5 realized demand points: (95+71+136+59+129)/5 = 98. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~33), I will use 'recent_5' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while using the promised lead time of 0. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (1+0=1 total period), maintaining a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1025.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for 'chips(Regular)'. Observed demand for Periods 1-5 is 95, 71, 136, 59, and 59. The average demand across these five periods is 84 units, while the standard deviation is approximately 32.5. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that all orders have arrived within the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0). Since the product on-hand inventory is 96 and there are no in-transit units, we need the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level based on the most recent demand statistics. Given the relatively small sample size and slight downward trend or volatility in the last two periods (59, 59), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full recent history while allowing the system to adjust to the observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1382.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the historical demand (P1: 95, P2: 71, P3: 136, P4: 59, P5: 59, P6: 76), there isn't a clear trend or seasonal shift yet, but demand is volatile (mean ~82.7, range 59-136). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 62 units on-hand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full recent history which covers the product's variability. This will provide a balanced base stock to cover demand for the current period (L+1=1) while maintaining a buffer for the high variance observed (e.g., P3 demand of 136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we experienced a stockout because the demand (144) exceeded our starting inventory (131). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 concluded periods. Calculating the demand statistics from all available history (8 data points: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 from initial context and 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144 from game history - wait, let me re-evaluate the full demand sequence). History demand values are: P1:95, P2:71, P3:136, P4:59, P5:59, P6:76, P7:144. Mean across 7 periods is approx 91.4. In-transit and On-hand are both 0. Given the high volatility (Std Dev approx 36), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the recent higher variance and ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent another stockout, especially since the service level target (q = 19/20 = 0.95) is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2776.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods based on the last 8 periods of data. The demand history shows significant volatility and recently trended higher: P7 (144) and P8 (147) are much higher than the initial samples (avg ~90). The mean of all 8 periods is approximately 98.5. However, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have a mean of 106.5 and the last 2 are very high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility while maintaining enough samples to cushion against the high standard deviation (std ~38). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent spikes and reduces the risk of stockouts seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~80 units (P1-P6) to ~145 units (P7-P8), representing an ~80% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1349.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant shift starting at Period 7. While P1-P6 averaged ~82 units, P7 and P8 surged to ~145 units. Period 9 saw a drop to 76 units, but given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts (as seen in Period 7), I will treat the last three periods (P7-P9) as the current regime to calculate requirements. The average demand for P7-P9 is approximately 122 units ((144+147+76)/3). The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met based on historical 'conclude' messages (every order from P1 to P9 arrived in 0 periods). I will set L to default (0), mu_hat to use recent_N with N=3 to capture the increased mean and volatility of this new regime, and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to account for the high variance between the peak of 147 and the recent 76.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1231.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant variability over the last several periods. Following a spike in periods 7 and 8 (averaging 145.5), demand has dropped back down in periods 9 and 10 (averaging 73.5), which is closer to the early period mean (periods 1-6 average ~77.7). This suggests the high demand in P7-P8 was a transient peak rather than a permanent regime shift, or that demand is highly volatile. Given the updated history, I will reset the demand window to look at the last 4 periods (P7-P10) to balance the recent high peak and the subsequent drop, yielding a mean of ~109.5. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since the profit to holding cost ratio is high (19:1), a slightly conservative sigma estimate is used to prevent stockouts during potential peaks.

Carry-over insight: The demand regime shift noted in Period 9 appears to have been transient or part of high volatility; demand in P9-P10 (avg 73.5) returned to levels seen in P1-P6 (~78) after the P7-P8 spike (~145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $862.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility but generally indicates a return to a lower-demand regime following a brief spike in Periods 7-8. Over the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has been 76, 71, and 52 respectively, averaging approximately 66.3 units. This is quite lower than the overall historical mean of ~89 units. Given the inventory on hand is 126 units, which is nearly double the recent average demand, it is appropriate to use recent history to calibrate the forecast and prevent overstocking. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout all 11 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture the cooling demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed high variance (ranging from 52 to 147). This targets a baseline that respects the return to lower consumption levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9-P12) shows a stable average of approximately 68 units (76, 71, 52, 73), which is consistent with the pre-spike period (P1-P6 average of 78). The spikes in P7-P8 (144, 147) appear to be outliers or a transient shift that has ended. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent stability while moving past the spike. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 concluded periods, I will continue using the promised lead time of 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to include a bit more historical volatility in the safety stock calculation given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile), ensuring we avoid the stockouts experienced in P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a transient spike in Periods 7-8. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 66.2 units (76, 71, 52, 73, 59), which is consistent with the early baseline (P1-P6 avg: 72.3 units). There is no evidence of sustained regime change since the P7-P8 anomaly. The lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. Since demand is currently stable with moderate volatility, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable state while remaining responsive to any new shifts. On-hand inventory is 77, and there are no in-transit units, so the algorithm will target a base stock sufficient for the upcoming period's demand (L=0, so review + lead = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1596.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear sustainable regime shift, though recent patterns suggest a fluctuation between ~60 and ~145 units. In Period 14, demand was 125 units, which exhausted the 84 units on hand, leading to a stockout. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=8 (covering Periods 7-14), which captures both the high spike (P7-P8, P14) and the lower mean periods (P11-P13). This results in a mu_hat of ~93.4 units per period. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=8) to account for the recent standard deviation rather than the lifetime average, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that accommodates this volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility with occasional spikes (P7-P8, P14-P15). While there was a previous insight suggesting a return to a lower mean of ~78, the most recent two periods (P14: 125, P15: 102) show demand is trending higher again (avg 113.5). The stock-out in Period 14 (on-hand dropped to 0) highlights the risk of under-ordering. Profit ($19) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), suggesting a higher service level policy is optimal. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the current upward trend in demand while maintaining a buffer for volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the higher mean (avg 82.2) and high variance, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations are sensitive to recent spikes without overreacting to single-period outliers.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with frequent spikes exceeding 100 units; recent 2-period demand (P14-P15) averages 113.5 units vs the historical average of ~88.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 1 to Period 16 shows high volatility but no sustained shift to a new regime. Although previous insights noted spikes (P7-P8 and P14-P15), Period 16 demand (68 units) sits below the overall historical average of ~88 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), I will use the last 10 periods for mu_hat to capture the 'current' volatility without overreacting to the single P16 drop or the transient spikes. Setting N=10 for mu_hat results in an average demand of ~87.5 units per period. Since L=0, (1+L) * 87.5 = 87.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect recent variance, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the observed spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2290.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the on-hand inventory is 28 units with no in-transit stock. Historical data shows that lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand is highly volatile with frequent spikes (e.g., 144 in P7, 147 in P8, 125 in P14, 122 in P17). The recent average demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is 93.6 units, compared to the overall average of 90.6. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. To capture recent volatility and the slight upward trend in mean demand, I will use a recent window of N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is responsive to the current demand distribution while smoothing out some of the period-to-period noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1877.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a stable regime. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has fluctuated significantly: 59, 125, 102, 68, 122, and 101, averaging 96.17 units. This represents a moderate increase from the broader historical average of approximately 88. Significant spikes (above 100 units) have occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in the log. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level (q) target is very high (95%), making it costly to stock out. To capture the recent upward trend and volatility while remaining responsive, I am using a recent window of N=6 for mu_hat Calculations and N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the underlying variance of this erratic demand pattern. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated with a recent 6-period mean of 96.17 (P13-P18), compared to the earlier historical average of ~80. Spikes >100 units now occur frequently (3 out of the last 5 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand remains highly volatile. The recent 7-period mean (P13-P19) is 90.57 units, while the overall historical mean (P1-P19) is approximately 89 units. In Period 19, demand was lower than average (57 units), leaving 82 units on-hand. Because spikes >120 occur periodically (P14, P15, P17) and lead time is 0, we need sufficient base stock to cover potential high-demand events within the current period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current volatility and mean more accurately than the full history, as demand patterns have fluctuated significantly across the 19 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows continued high volatility with frequent spikes. Most recently, Period 20 saw a significant spike of 148 units (which resulted in a stockout), while Period 19 was relatively low at 57 units. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), the average demand is approximately 97.75 units, which is notably higher than the early historical average of ~80. Given the recent stockout in Period 20 and the frequency of spikes exceeding 100 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this elevated demand regime. I will also use recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (P1-P20), so I will use the default promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated with frequent spikes; the average demand for the period segment P13-P20 is approximately 98 units, reflecting a ~22% increase over the initial baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with periodic spikes. Since Period 13, the average demand has settled around 98.4 units, which is higher than the initial baseline (approx 80). The most recent demand (Period 21) was 65 units, but Period 20 saw a peak of 148 units (causing a stockout). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend needs to maintain a high service level. Lead time consistency is high with stable 0-period arrivals. To capture the current regime's mean and volatility while remaining responsive to the frequent spikes observed between P13 and P21, I am using a recent_N window of 9 periods (P13-P21). Lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P13-P22) continues to show highly volatile behavior with frequent spikes over 100 units (6 out of the last 10 periods). The mean demand for this segment is approximately 95.9 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline but consistent with the pattern noted in the Period 21 carry-over insight. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Since L=0, the review period is essentially only the current period (1+L=1). I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture this elevated and volatile regime while discounting older, lower-demand periods. This setting (N=10) provides a robust mean (approx 96) and captures the higher standard deviation seen in the current regime, allowing the OR backend's service level logic (based on the $19/$1 profit-to-holding ratio) to maintain sufficient buffer against the frequent demand spikes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with a baseline shift identified around Period 13. While the initial periods (P1-P12) averaged ~83 units, the subsequent period (P13-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 95 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 100 units (6 out of the last 11 periods). The most recent demand in Period 23 was low (53), but following the high demand in Period 22 (112), this suggests the high-variance regime persists. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand, high-volatility regime (P13-P23) while filtering out the lower early-game baseline. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to capitalize on the $19 profit margin while accounting for the significant variance observed in the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 13-23 confirms a sustained increase in both mean (~95 units) and volatility compared to P1-P12 (~83 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 13. Over the most recent 12-period segment (P13-P24), the average demand is approximately 92 units per period, while the mean for the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) is 94 units. There is a clearly established pattern of frequent spikes exceeding 140 units (as seen in P20 and P7-P8). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), a high service level is required. I will use a recent_N approach with N=12 to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods (P1-P12). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and the significant standard deviation observed in the current period cluster.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 25 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime of higher volatility and a slightly higher mean desde Period 13. While the last five periods (P21-P25) have averaged 77 units, the broader regime since P13 averages approximately 90 units with frequent spikes exceeding 120 units (P14, P17, P20). To ensure a 95% service level (calculated from Profit $19 and Holding $1) and account for this volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13, covering the entire period from P13 to P25. This captures the current regime's higher variance better than a global average would. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1659.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher-mean regime that began around Period 13. Over the last 14 periods (P13-P26), the mean demand is approximately 87 units per period, but this period segment is characterized by high volatility (standard deviation ~31) with frequent spikes over 100 units (e.g., P14, P15, P17, P18, P20, P22). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we capture this recent volatility while maintaining sufficient inventory to cover the high service level requirements (Profit:Holding = 19:1), I will use N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire scope of the current regime starting from P13. The on-hand inventory is currently at 51, and there are no units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2241.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P13-P27) remains elevated compared to early periods. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), allowing for responsive inventory management. Although demand in P27 was 119, the average demand since P13 is approximately 95 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~31). With on-hand inventory at 20 units and a promised lead time of 0, I must ensure current supply covers the probable demand for this period. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), a high service level is preferred. I will use the recent 15 periods (P13-P27) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to accurately reflect the current higher demand regime and its volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the elevated regime identified since Period 13, with a mean demand of approximately 92.4 units and significant volatility. Recent demand (P24-P28) shows a mean of 84.6 units, but frequent spikes (e.g., 119 in P27) necessitate maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'concluded' messages through Period 28. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the optimal service level is high (q=0.95), suggesting we should prioritize availability over lean inventory. I will use a recent_N approach (N=16, encompassing the regime since P13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility while filtering out the initial lower-demand period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-mean, higher-variance regime since roughly Period 13. Over the last 15 periods (P15-P29), the average demand is approximately 91.5 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 120 units (e.g., P20, P27, P29). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (approx. 95%). To capture the recent sustained demand level and volatility while filtering out older, lower-demand data (P1-P12 avg was ~83), I am using a recent_N of 15 periods. This covers the current stable regime and ensures we have enough units to satisfy potential spikes like the 124 units seen in Period 29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the elevated regime identified since Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 89.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 29 units. The most recent demand (P29: 124, P30: 121) confirms high-side volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving within the same period. To capture the current behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, I am using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term trend of ~90 units/period with the significant volatility. The profit margin is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), justifying a high service level which the backend's base-stock logic will execute based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2083.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase in both volume and volatility. In the most recent block (P24-P31), the average demand is 97.3 units, compared to the early baseline of approximately 80-83 units. Key spikes (111, 121, 124 units) have occurred in the last three periods consecutively. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To protect against these recent high-demand streaks and stockout risks, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime specifically. With a high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level, which is appropriate given the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24-31 confirms a further sustained increase in mean demand to ~97 units with higher frequency of spikes exceeding 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2040.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime over the last 9 periods (P24-P32). In this period segment, the average demand is approximately 97.77 units, with a notable increase in frequency of demand exceeding 110 units (seen in P27, P29, P30, P31). This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 32. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this current elevated demand regime (P24 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher mean and the recent volatility, minimizing the risk of stockouts which occurred earlier in the game when baseline estimates were too low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1641.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P24-P33) shows a sustained high mean of approximately 97 units with periodic spikes. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) have an average demand of 110.8 units, significantly higher than the long-term history, indicating a shift towards the upper bound of the current regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent elevated demand and maintain high service levels (profit $19 vs holding cost $1), I am using the most recent 10 samples (P24-P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N=10 window aligns with the regime shift identified in the carry-over insights for Period 32, balancing the need for stability with sensitivity to the observed increase in volume and spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand continues to stabilize in the higher regime; the 10-period average (P24-P33) is ~97.1, with the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33) averaging ~110.8, confirming sustained high demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-level regime starting approximately at Period 24. While the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a slight decrease in demand compared to the P29-P33 peak (averaging ~101.8 vs ~110.8), it remain significantly higher than the early historical baseline. The 11-period segment (P24-P34) has a mean of ~96.5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high service level required (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent window of N=11 to capture this sustained higher demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock level account for the frequent spikes observed in this segment.

Over the last 12 periods (P24-P35), the average demand is ~95.3 units, but the last 7 periods (P29-P35) show a slightly higher average of ~105 units. Most recently (P35), demand was 106. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). To respond to this sustained increase and capture frequent spikes (like the 124 in P29 and 121 in P30), I am using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime (P26-P35) while maintaining enough history to estimate volatility. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24-35 is sustained at a mean of ~95-105 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (P1-P12 avg ~83).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand spiked to 142 units, exceeding the starting on-hand inventory of 136 and resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand regime has sustained a higher level since Period 24, with the last 13 periods (P24-P36) averaging 100.38 units and showing increased volatility (standard deviation ~23.8). To prevent further stockouts and adapt to this sustained high-demand regime, I will use a window of the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture these shifts in both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This period starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, so a robust order based on these parameters is necessary to capture upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24-36 is established at a mean of ~100 units with increased volatility (std ~24), representing a significant increase over the initial P1-P12 baseline (~83 units).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-level regime starting approximately at Period 24. While Period 37 saw a lower demand of 67 units, this follows a significant spike of 142 units in Period 36. Since Period 24, the demand has averaged approximately 97.4 units with a standard deviation of about 24 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages consistently show that orders arrive within the same period (L=0). Lead time remains stable. I will use the recent 14 periods (P24-P37) to capture this established higher-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current 100-unit average while protecting against frequent spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the early periods. Since Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of about 23. This is significantly higher than the initial P1-P12 baseline of ~83 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 114 units, slightly above the current regime mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering P24-P38) to capture this established higher-demand regime and its associated volatility while ensuring the base stock level (target on-hand + current demand) is robust against frequent spikes. L is set to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1360.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift that began around Period 24. For the most recent 16 periods (P24-P39), the average demand is approximately 98.8 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight indicating a regime of roughly 100 units. The volatility in this period range is also higher, with a standard deviation of approximately 24.7. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as orders), so I will use L=0. To capture the current demand level and volatility accurately, I am using recent_N with N=16, covering the stable portion of the current high-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the ~100 unit mean and the increased frequency of spikes (up to 142 units in P36). With on-hand inventory at 65 and no in-transit units, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on these updated parameters to ensure sufficient service levels for the upcoming period while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~100 units with high volatility (std ~25) since Period 24; recent 16-period data (P24-P39) provides the best anchor for current parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2482.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units with high volatility (std approx 25) since Period 24. Recent history (P24-P40) supports this, with the 17-period mean being 100.1 and standard deviation 24.3. Period 40 actual demand was 131, confirming that high-demand spikes remain a significant factor. On-hand inventory is currently very low (7 units) with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time consistently follows this (orders arrive same-period), I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current regime and ensure sufficient stock for the high service level (profit/cost ratio is very high), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (P24-P40) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=17 to properly account for the observed volatility. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~100 plus a safety buffer for the frequent spikes.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 24, with significant volatility (standard deviation ~25). The most recent period (P41) saw a demand of 64, resulting in an ending inventory of 77 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows orders arriving in the same period (L=0). Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will continue using the recent 18-period window (P24-P41) to capture the current mean and volatility regime, which helps the system set an appropriate base stock to hedge against frequent spikes (e.g., >130 units observed in P36 and P40) while preventing excessive stockouts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-variance regime since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 95-100 units. Recent performance (P38-P42) shows high volatility: demand figures of 114, 75, 131, 64, and 51. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed arrive and satisfy demand in the same period. For Period 43, I will use recent_N with N=19 (covering P24 to P42) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the sustained 'higher regime' identified in the carry-over insights while providing enough data points to stabilize the standard deviation estimate in the face of recent lumpy demand. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-end spikes (like 131 or 142) which are frequent in this product's profile, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost to maintain a high service level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is stable at an average of approximately 100 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~25). The most recent 3 periods (P41-P43) saw a slight dip in demand (avg 70), but given the historical frequency of spikes and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), it is prudent to maintain parameters that support the established 100-unit regime to avoid stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met according to the history, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained regime from Period 24 onwards for both mean and volatility, which provides a robust statistical base for the OR engine's base-stock calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 98.7 units (P24-P44) and a standard deviation of ~25.5. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P40-P44) has averaged 87 units, but the broader segment since P24 remains the most reliable anchor for forecasting, given the frequent spikes seen in the history (e.g., P36, P40). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 (P24 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained regime while ignoring the lower-demand early history (P1-P23). The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has been consistently higher and more volatile than the baseline, with a mean of approximately 100 units and a standard deviation of 25. Recent demand in Period 45 was 123 units, confirming that spikes still occur. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=22 (covering the Period 24-45 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained higher demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime since Period 24, with a mean of approximately 100 units. Recent demand (P41-P46) shows a slight dip (avg ~81 units), but volatility remains significant with several spikes over 110 units in the P30-P45 window. The critical decision is based on the verified lead time L=0 (same-day arrival), which allows for lean inventory management. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P24-P46) while smoothing out localized noise. This N-value covers the high-demand period identified in the carry-over insights and ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~100) and standard deviation (~25). The OR backend will use these to satisfy the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $878.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has been consistently identified as stable around a mean of ~100 units with high volatility (std ~25). Recent demand (P41-P47) has fluctuated between 51 and 123, with a 7-period average of ~77.5, which is lower than the long-term stable mean but within the expected high-volatility range. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). Current on-hand inventory is 91 units. Since we are in the final periods of the game (P48 of 50) and lead time is consistently 0, I will use a window of recent_N=24 (covering P24-P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the sustained high-volatility regime identified in the carry-over insights while allowing the backend to calculate ordering needs based on the established mean (~95-100) and variance. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2002.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been consistently elevated since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 95-100 units and significant volatility (standard deviation around 25). The most recent demand at Period 48 was 107 units, and the current on-hand inventory is 31 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility and service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=20 to capture the stable behavior of the current regime starting from Period 24. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher mean and the frequent spikes observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1679.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a mean (mu) of approximately 100 units with high volatility (sigma ~25-27) since Period 24. Recent data from Period 40 to Period 49 shows a 10-period mean of 87.1, but this includes several low-demand outliers (51, 64, 51) which are part of the high-variance nature of the product rather than a regime downshift. Historically, the regime since P24 has been better characterized by a mean of ~100. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (immediate arrival within the same period), and this is confirmed by the history up to P49. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established higher-demand regime while filtering out the very early low-demand baseline (P1-P12). L remains at default (0).
