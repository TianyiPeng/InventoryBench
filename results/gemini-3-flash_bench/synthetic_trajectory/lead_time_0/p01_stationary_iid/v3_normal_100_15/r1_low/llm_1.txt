Historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows demand values of 88, 133, 93, 108, and 110, resulting in an average demand of approximately 106 units per period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover the Period 1 demand immediately. I will target slightly above the average to account for potential variance (around 110-120 units).

Since the Holding Cost ($1.0) is equal to the Profit per unit ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to maintain a 'just-in-time' inventory level that minimizes stockouts while avoiding excessive ending inventory. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory. To cover the expected demand for Period 35 and provide a small safety margin based on recent volatility, I will order 125 units. This target aligns with the higher end of the recent demand distribution, ensuring a high service level while the equal cost/profit ratio suggests slightly protecting against stockouts is better than constant shortages (as seen in periods 2, 13, 14, 27, and 34).",
