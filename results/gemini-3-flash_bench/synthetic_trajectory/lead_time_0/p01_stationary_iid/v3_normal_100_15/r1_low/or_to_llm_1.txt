Strategy: The OR recommendation of 82 units is calculated based on a base-stock policy that targets a specific service level.

Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting we should aim to cover the median demand to minimize total costs (holding vs. stockout). Historical demand fluctuates between ~80 and ~130. Ordering 101 units aligns perfectly with the average demand and provides a reasonable buffer without incurring excessive holding costs, especially since this is the final period (Period 50 of 50).",
