Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is promised at 0 periods (same-period arrival), I need to place an order immediately to satisfy Period 1's demand.

Since lead time is 0, the order I place now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase, just before demand is calculated.
