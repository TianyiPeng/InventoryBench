'chips(Regular)' is a standard snack item with a historical demand range between 88 and 133 across the first 5 provided samples (Mean: 106.4). Since the lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), the order placed now will arrive before demand is resolved in Period 1. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the maximum historical sample in the prompt is 133, and the average is ~106, I will order 120 units to provide a buffer for first-period demand and create a small initial safety stock for Period 2.",
