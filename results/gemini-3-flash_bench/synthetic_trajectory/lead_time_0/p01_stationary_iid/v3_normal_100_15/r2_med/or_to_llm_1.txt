P40 doesn't correspond to any major calendar events that would cause a spike for regular chips.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 21 and there is no in-transit inventory since L=0. To minimize both stockouts (which happen often when starting inventory is ~113-115) and holding costs ($1/unit), I need to target a starting inventory for the period that covers high-percentile demand.\n4. Strategy: Historical data shows demand occasionally peaks above 120 (P2, P10, P20, P33). A starting inventory (OH + Order) of 120-125 seems optimal given profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). The OR recommendation of 92 units results in a starting inventory of 113 (21+92). Looking at history, starting with 113 resulted in stockouts in P33 and P38.

This confirms a 0-period lead time, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 40-49) has been fluctuating around a mean of approx 100 units (98, 85, 98, 111, 107, 82, 112, 124, 78). The OR recommendation for Period 50 is 78 units.\n3. **Inventory & Strategy**: On-hand inventory is 35 units. Since lead time is 0, the total available to meet Period 50's demand will be (On-hand + Order). OR recommends 78, which makes total inventory 113. This 113 level has been a consistent 'base-stock' target in the history (e.g., Periods 36-39, 41-45, 48-49). Given that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stayed relatively stable within the 80-120 range, 113 total units is a safe buffer that minimizes stockouts without excessive holding costs.\n4. **Final Action**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 78 units to bring total inventory to 113.",
