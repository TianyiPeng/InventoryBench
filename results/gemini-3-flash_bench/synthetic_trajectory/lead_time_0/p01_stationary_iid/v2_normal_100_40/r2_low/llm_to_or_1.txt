  Samples: [('Period_1', 143), ('Period_2', 103), ('Period_3', 39), ('Period_4', 81), ('Period_5', 99)]
  Mean: 93.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Promised lead time is 0, so orders placed now should arrive and be sold in the same period. Initial demand samples show an average of 93 units across the first 5 periods (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Since on-hand is 0, I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline. mu_hat will use all available samples to estimate the immediate demand (1+0) * mean(93).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods (ordered 93, arrived 93), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was very low (3 units), compared to the long-term historical average (approx. 93). Given the provided historical demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 5 (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), we can see demand is volatile. Since we only have one period of game history (Period 1 actual demand = 3), but the provided samples suggest the mean is significantly higher, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the variability shown in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section (mean ~93). I will retain L=0 (default) as confirmed by the P1 result.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-56.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 3 and 17. However, the external demand data provided for Period 1-5 indicates a much higher series: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. The game history shows realized demand in P1 (3) and P2 (17) was significantly lower than the provided samples for those same periods (143, 103). This suggests the provided samples represent potential market demand, while realized demand is influenced by availability or other factors, though here availability was sufficient. Given the volatility (3 to 17 is a sharp increase) and the provided sample mean (~93), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the upward trend in realized demand while acknowledging the sample context. Lead time is confirmed as 0 (P1 order arrived in P1). I will set L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to weigh the most recent realized demand highly while moving towards the expected mean of the broader sample set.

Daily Profit: $73.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the available inventory (73) was depleted by a demand spike of 81 units, leaving 0 on-hand inventory and 8 unsatisfied units. The in-transit pipeline is also empty. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including samples provided in the prompt) has been 143, 103, 39, 81, and 99. The observed demand from 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-3 were 3, 17, and 81 respectively. Note the discrepancy: the game history 'conclude' demand (3, 17, 81) differs from the 'Historical Demand Data' sample list (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). I will prioritize the 'conclude' data as it reflects the current game state. Promised lead time is 1, and the Period 1 order arrived in Period 1 (lead_time 0). Demand is clearly trending upwards (3 -> 17 -> 81). I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this upward shift and ensure we restock sufficiently to meet the current higher demand level (average of 3, 17, 81 is ~33.6, but the most recent was 81). I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend from Period 1 to Period 4 (3, 17, 81, 95). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1 and P4 arrived within the same period). Given the increasing demand and low inventory (lost sales occurred in P3 and P4), I need to set mu_hat conservatively to capture the recent high demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to focus on the shift seen in P2-P4, while keeping L as 'default' since the 0-period lead time is consistent with the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Reviewing historical demand from the internal data provided (P1: 143, P2: 103, P3: 39, P4: 81, P5: 99) and the conclude messages, we see a mismatch between the provided demand history and the 'sold' units in the game history due to stockouts. Specifically, Period 3, 4, and 5 all ended with 0 inventory, indicating we are under-ordering. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (P1, P4, P5 arrivals were same-day). The mean demand over the 5 known periods is (143+103+39+81+99)/5 = 93. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history to stabilize the forecast, as demand has been volatile (range 39-143). With profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the target service level is 50%, but since we have been stocking out, we need to ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are accurately captured to rebuild inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing chronic stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 4 periods) because demand is consistently outstripping supply. Historical demand (P1-P5) was [143, 103, 39, 81, 99], but actual demand observed in the 'conclude' messages for P1-P6 shows [3, 17, 81, 95, 114, 76]. Although the promised lead time is 0, the current on-hand and in-transit are both zero. I need to increase the safety stock and mean demand estimate significantly to catch up with the realized demand levels which are higher than the initial samples suggest. The OR engine calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With profit=1 and holding=1, q=0.5, so z=0. Under this symmetry, the order targets exactly mu_hat. To prevent further stockouts, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent high demand (avg of P4-P6 is ~95) plus a buffer for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and a general upward trend compared to the initial samples (P1-P5 avg ~93, P4-P7 demand: 95, 114, 76, 77). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P6, P7) confirm that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. We are currently holding 38 units. To prevent the stockouts seen in P3-P6, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P3-P7), which captures the more recent, higher demand variance. Specifically, mu_hat will be based on N=5 to reflect the recent average demand (~88.6 per period) across the (1+L)=1 period cycle. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to account for the significant variance observed lately. This should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the item 'chips(Regular)' has 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, having stocked out in Period 8. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) and game history demand (Periods 1-8) show a mean demand of approximately 74.5 units (93.1 including samples). However, more recent demand (last 3 periods: 76, 77, 108) averages around 87 units. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders arrive in the same period (lead_time 0 observed in P1, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8). To recover from the stockout and meet current demand levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the recent volatility and demand level while keeping L at default (0). With profit and holding cost equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level q = 0.5, meaning it will target the median demand. A recent_N approach helps account for the slightly higher recent demand variance compared to the early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1-9 consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrived the same period they were placed). Demand has shown high volatility with a recent average (Periods 4-9) of approximately 93 units per period. I will set the lead time L to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 4-9) to capture the demand regime after the initial low-demand periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect current volatility. With on-hand inventory at only 6 units and demand averaging around 93, the OR engine needs to order sufficient stock to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is currently 0 after a high demand of 125 in Period 10. Reviewing historical demand from the game history (3, 17, 81, 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125), there is a visible regime shift from very low early demand to a sustained higher level starting around Period 3. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (Periods 3-10) is approximately 95.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, as confirmed by 'arrived=X units (ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods)' in the history. To prevent stockouts, which have occurred in 6 out of 10 periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 8 periods to reflect recent volatility. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, essentially targeting the mean; however, the capped policy and the base stock formula will aim to cover the demand for the next period (L+1 = 1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 3 onwards: mean demand increased to ~95 units compared to early periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 4. Analysis of demand from Period 4 to 11 shows a mean of approximately 98.8 units (95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125, 107) and a standard deviation of roughly 17.5. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true based on the 'conclude' messages. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0, in-transit: 0) and have experienced lost sales in the previous two periods. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this current high-demand regime specifically. Setting L to 'default' (0) ensures the system focuses on immediate replenishment to meet the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 95 units per period since Period 4, following an initial volatile startup. Despite the promised lead time of 0, the actual lead time observed in history has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 12, demand was 82, leaving 17 units on-hand. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). Using a recent_N of 9 (Periods 4-12) captures this current regime effectively. The goal is to set mu_hat to cover one period's demand (L=0, so (1+0)*mean) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a 50% service level target as dictated by the costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the very early periods. Analyzing the historical demand from Period 4 to Period 13 (the last 10 samples), the mean demand is approximately 97.4 units (95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125, 107, 82, 100), with a standard deviation of about 16.5. This confirms the carry-over insight of a shift to ~95+ units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure we meet demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a N=10 period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Since Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (base_stock roughly equals mu). By using recent_N=10, we accurately capture the current regime's higher mean and its variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 3 onwards confirms a regime shift with a higher mean and significant volatility. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P3-P14), the average demand is approximately 98.4 units per period. The inventory has frequently hit zero, resulting in lost sales, which suggests the current stock levels are insufficient for the demand volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods to capture this higher demand regime (N=12) and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the actual observed variance in this period range. This will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock to reduce stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Equal to profit).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (calculated from Period 3 to Period 15) shows a stable mean of approximately 100.08 units per period, while the early periods (P1-P2) had much lower demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods across all arrived orders. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both currently 0, indicating significant stockouts and lost sales in the previous two periods (P14 and P15). Profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. To capture the current regime while recovering from the stockout, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 13 samples (the current regime length) and choosing 'calculate' for lead time since 0 is consistently observed. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 13 samples to accurately reflect the volatility of this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 100 units from Period 3 onwards (P3-P15 mean: 100.08), consistently higher than the initial phase.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 3. For the last 14 periods (P3-P16), the average demand is approximately 100.08 units. Recent performance shows frequent stockouts because the OR backend's cap or parameters have been too conservative for this high-demand scenario. The 'Period 16 conclude' shows a demand of 100, which is perfectly aligned with the average. I will use recent_N=14 to capture this stable regime (P3-P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), which results in a base stock level approximately equal to the mean demand. Verified lead time is consistently 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. Looking at the last 15 periods (P3-P17), the average demand is approximately 99.3 units with a standard deviation of about 20.2 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 18, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture this stable regime (P3-P17) while excluding the early outliers from P1 and P2. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5. This means the OR backend will target the median demand. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 samples ensures the inventory policy reflects current consumption rates while maintaining a buffer for volatility (~20 units). The on-hand inventory is currently 40 units, and there are no units in transit, so an order will be triggered to reach the calculated base stock.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be stable following the regime shift identified around Period 3. Over the last 15 periods (P4-P18), the mean demand is approximately 97.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 20. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 21 units on hand and 0 in transit. To maintain a high service level while managing a holding cost equal to profit (Profit=1, Holding=1), the OR backend's default base-stock logic (z* at 50% service level for q=0.5) might be too conservative given our historical stockouts. However, focusing on recent behavior (N=16 to include the full stable regime since the shift) will provide the most accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time and use 'recent_N' with N=16 for demand parameters to capture the post-shift volatility and mean accurately.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 through Period 19, the mean demand is approximately 96.2 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by the 'arrived' messages in the concluding history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the demand regime since Period 3. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 96.2 mean demand while accounting for volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units) and there is no inventory in transit, so the backend will place an order to reach the target base stock. Given Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the model toward a service level around the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a marked increase over the last five periods, moving from an average of ~100 to an average of ~115.8 (Periods 16-20), with a recent peak of 147 in Period 20. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory of 0 in 11 out of 20 periods), I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to better reflect the current regime and ensure higher availability. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat captures this recent climb. For the variance (sigma_hat), I am using a recent_N of 18 (representing the stable regime since period 3) to provide a robust estimate of volatility without overreacting to the single high-demand spike in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime has shifted significantly upwards in the last 5 periods (P16-P20 average: 115.8) compared to the previous stable average of 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 16. While Carry-over Insights for Period 21 noted an upward trend (P16-P20 average: 115.8), Period 21 itself saw a sharp drop to 46 units. This creates significant volatility. However, the overall demand levels since Period 16 remain consistently higher than the very early periods. By calculating the average of the last 6 periods (P16-P21), we get a mean of 87.5 units. Given that the lead time is consistently 0 (the order arrives in the same period it is placed), the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat captures this recent volatility while adjusting for the latest dip. I will continue to use the default lead time (0) as verified by history and the default sigma_hat calculation to cover the current variance in demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant regime shift. While the average from Period 3-15 was approximately 100 units, the more recent period (P16-P22) shows increased volatility and a mean of approximately 88.5, though Period 20 peaked at 147. Notably, inventory reached zero in Period 22, indicating stockouts. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand (mu_hat) to balance service level and costs. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility (P16-P22). This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for recent demand spikes like Period 20 and the stockout in Period 22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand shows a significant increase in recent periods, particularly a spike to 169 units in Period 23. While the average over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 109.8 units, the high volatility (ranging from 46 to 169) suggests that a 'recent_N' approach with a small window would be too reactive, whereas the long-term 'default' average (approx 97) is too low. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current high-demand environment (Periods 16-23 mean \u2248 101.4) while mitigating the effect of the single outlier in P23. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to 'default'. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the high recent variance, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the increased volatility and avoid stockouts, especially since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, leading to a target service level (q) of 0.5.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 20, with a major spike to 169 units in Period 23, while the mean appears to fluctuate around 100-110 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the game shows we are currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory after failing to meet the full demand in Period 24 (110 demand vs 99 arrived). Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been volatile recently, with a spike to 169 in Period 23 and 110 in Period 24. Since Period 20, the demand counts are [147, 46, 93, 169, 110], averaging approximately 113 units per period. The standard deviation has also increased due to these swings. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5 (equal to the median under normal distribution). To capture the recent shift in both mean and volatility observed since Period 20, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and increased variance while lead time L remains at the promised/observed value of 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility. Since Period 21, demand values have been: 46, 93, 169, 110, and 100. This results in a local mean of approximately 103.6 units over the last 5 periods, but with significant variance (std deviation ~44). The service level target is 50% (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1)), which means the OR engine will aim to stock near the mean. Given the extreme outlier in Period 23 (169), I will use the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent average, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the higher current volatility, ensuring the safety stock (even at a 50% service level target) accounts for the recent instability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility. Since Period 21, demand has fluctuated significantly (values of 46, 93, 169, 110, 100, 82). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 97.3, while the last 5 periods (P22-P26) average 109.8. Given the increased volatility noted in the Carry-over Insights (specifically the spike in P23), a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 is appropriate to capture the current mean while smoothing the recent outlier. For sigma_hat, N=10 is also used to capture the heightened variability observing the recent spikes and drops (std is significantly higher than earlier phases). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the Period 23 spike; Period 23-26 shows a range from 82 to 169 units, confirming a less stable regime than the Period 11-16 window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and frequent stockouts. In Period 27, demand spiked to 145 units, exceeding the available on-hand inventory of 98. Over the last 8 periods (P20-P27), demand has averaged 111.5 units with a high standard deviation (approx 40), compared to the previous long-term average of 100. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To prevent the recurring stockouts observed in periods 20, 22, 23, 24, and 27, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent_N window of 8 periods to capture this higher mean (approx 111.5) and increasing sigma_hat using the same window to account for the heightened volatility (approx 40). This will result in a higher base stock level to better handle the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 20 onwards (P20-P27) shows a higher mean (~111.5) and increased volatility compared to the P11-P16 stable window.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 20 onwards) exhibits a higher mean (approx 111.5) and significantly increased volatility compared to earlier periods. The latest demand (Period 28) was 115, following a high of 145 in Period 27. I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time, which has consistently been 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the behavior of the current regime that started around Period 20. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock level to account for the current mean and the elevated volatility (historical spikes like 169 units), ensuring better coverage against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 111.9 units (Periods 20-29). The latest observation in Period 29 (93 units) is slightly below this mean but consistent with the volatility observed in this regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as all orders since Period 1 have arrived within the same period they were placed. Currently, we have 19 units on hand and 0 in-transit. To maintain a high service level given the high volatility (sigma is significant) and the equal weights of profit and holding cost ($1 each), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture only the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 20. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant window of data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 20 to 29 confirmed: Mean ~111.9, with sustained high volatility (range 46-169). Actual lead time consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and a higher mean since Period 20, with recent demands of 145, 115, 93, and 54 in the last four periods. Period 30 saw a significant drop to 54, but given the historical range (46-169), this appears to be part of the high-variance regime rather than a shift to a lower mean. We are currently holding 56 units on-hand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. To capture the current regime which started around Period 20 (length 11 periods), I will use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for both the higher average demand (~106.6 units for P20-P30) and the increased volatility observed in this segment. This provides a balance between responding to the recent low demand and protecting against the frequent spikes seen earlier in the regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a regime shift that began around Period 20, characterized by a higher mean and significantly increased volatility. The average demand since Period 20 (Periods 20-31) is approximately 105 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 36 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 31 conclude' message showing the Period 31 order arrived within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. To account for the sustained high volatility and ensure a high service level given that profit equals holding cost (q = 0.5, z* = 0), I will use a recent_N window of 12 periods (N=12, covering the start of the current regime at P20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand behavior. This allows the base stock to adjust to the current mean of ~105 and the high variance observed in this stretch.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 20 to 32 shows a mean of approximately 104 units with significant volatility (std dev ~33.5). The most recent three periods (P30-P32) had demands of 54, 111, and 99. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To account for the sustained high volatility and the recent mean, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the regime start at P20) and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the increased variance observed in this period. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit higher mean and volatility compared to the initial phase of the simulation. Since Period 20, the demand characteristic has shifted to a regime with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation around 33. The most recent three periods (P31-P33) show demand of 111, 99, and 71. While Period 33 was lower, the broader context since Period 20 justifies using a wider window to capture the sustained high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering observations from Period 20 to 33) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window balances the need to capture the current regime's variance while filtering out very short-term noise. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P33 order arrived in P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 20 to Period 34) is characterized by a mean demand of approximately 104 units (1560 total / 15 periods) and sustained high volatility compared to earlier stages of the game. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P25-P34) average 103 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median demand to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 15 for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current volatile regime while providing enough samples to stabilize the estimates.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~31) since Period 20. Recent periods (P31-P35) show a mean demand of 95, while the P20-P35 average is 98.7, maintaining the higher regime compared to the early game. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median of the demand distribution to balance stockout risks and holding costs. I will use recent_N=16 (covering Period 20 to Period 35) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while reflecting the higher demand floor established after Period 20.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 100-110 units since Period 20. The most recent 10-period average (P27-P36) is approximately 99 units, while the 17-period average (P20-P36) is approximately 105 units. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the target base stock equal to the mean demand for the (L+1) period (which is 1 period here since L=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the mean demand of the current regime while accounting for the high volatility observed. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown persistent high volatility recently, with a significant spike to 167 units in Period 37, similar to the spike of 169 units in Period 23. Over the last 18 periods (since Period 20), the mean demand is approximately 104.2 units, but the high variance (std ~30) necessitates a higher safety stock to prevent stockouts, especially given that we ended Period 37 with 0 units on hand. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). I will use the recent 18 periods (the window since the major volatility shift around Period 20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to capture the current mean while accounting for the significant variance observed in recent cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we observe high demand levels in recent periods (P37: 167, P38: 150). The mean demand from Period 20 to Period 38 is approximately 104, but there is a noticeable upward trend in the most recent 10 periods (average ~104) and specifically the last 2-3 periods (well above 130). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods to capture this higher-demand, higher-volatility regime (P24-P38) while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased average and the frequent spikes, minimizing lost sales which have been occurring frequently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 31 to 38 shows elevated volatility and an upward shift in peaks (P37: 167, P38: 150), suggesting a possible further increase in mean demand compared to the P20-P30 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 39 dropped significantly to 11 units, following high demand in Periods 37 (167) and 38 (150). This suggests either a extreme outlier or the start of a new, lower-demand regime. Looking at the history, such sharp drops have occurred before (e.g., Period 30: 54, Period 21: 46), often followed by a return to the mean. However, given the current high on-hand inventory (97 units), which is close to the recent average demand (~110-115), a conservative ordering approach is warranted to avoid high holding costs while still protecting against a rebound to high demand. I will use a recent window (N=9, covering P31-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the recent high-volatility period including the current dip. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher volatility regime, evidenced by a sharp spike to 182 units in Period 40, following high demands of 167 and 150 in Periods 37 and 38. Although Period 39 was an outlier (demand of 11), the overall trend from Period 31 to 40 suggests a mean of approximately 110 units with a very high standard deviation (approx 50 units). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle this volatility and avoid frequent stockouts (seen in Period 40 where on-hand was insufficient), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent high-variance regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to buffer against the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Mean ~110.3, with significantly higher volatility and more frequent large spikes (max 182 units in P40). Actual lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a demand regime that shifted around Period 31, characterized by a mean of approximately 110-115 units and significantly higher volatility with frequent spikes (e.g., P37: 167, P38: 150, P40: 182, P41: 149). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to set parameters that provide sufficient coverage for this high-volatility environment while maintaining the base stock levels. I will use the last 11 samples (P31-P41) to capture this most recent regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=11). This period's demand (P41) was 149, which aligns with the observed upward trend in spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-volatility regime identified around Period 31, with a mean demand of approximately 110-115 units and frequent spikes (e.g., P40 at 182, P41 at 149). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 42 conclude' message showing same-period arrival. Despite the volatility, the recent demand in P42 moderated to 87 units, leaving 27 units on hand. To capture the current regime's higher peaks and average, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (representing the period since the last major regime shift in Period 31). This allows the OR engine to account for both the elevated mean and the significant standard deviation observed in recent weeks, ensuring a sufficient base stock to cover the frequent upward spikes while remaining reactive to the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent stockouts (ending on-hand=0 in Periods 40, 41, and 43). In Period 43, the demand was 117, resulting in a stockout since on-hand was 112. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Since Period 31, the demand mean has stabilized around 110 units but with high variability (standard deviation is roughly 45-50 units). To improve the service level and minimize lost sales, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (representing the regime since Period 31). This allows the OR backend to capture the current high-volatility environment and set a base stock level that accounts for the frequent demand spikes (like the 182 in P40 or 167 in P37), ensuring better availability while balancing holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and occasional large spikes (e.g., Period 37-38 and 40-41), while the mean demand since the last major regime shift in Period 31 remains roughly around 110 units. Specifically, from P31 to P44, the average demand is approximately 110.4 units with a high standard deviation (approx 45.4). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility and the fact that holding costs and stockout costs are equal ($1), the OR backend's service level target (profit/(profit+holding)) is 0.5. To capture the current regime's higher variance and ensure we cover potential spikes while not over-ordering, I am setting N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing the regime since P31). L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised lead time of 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has stabilized around a mean of approximately 110 units (P31-P45 mean: 115.3, median: 115) with high volatility (std dev ~43.5, driven by spikes up to 182 and a low of 11). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and current on-hand of 35, I will use recent_N (N=15, the length of the current regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior accurately while allowing the OR backend to set a sufficient base stock level. Profit and Holding cost being equal ($1.0) results in a target critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand naturally, but the high sigma_hat will provide the necessary safety buffer for the frequent spikes observed.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 remains characterized by high volatility and frequent large spikes, with a mean demand of approximately 111.9 units (P31-P46). Period 46 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory, and the order placed in Period 46 arrived within that period (L=0). I will continue using recent statistics from this stable but volatile regime (N=16, from Period 31 to 46) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock based on a target service level suitable for the $1 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (q=0.5). Given the proximity to the game end (Period 50), maintaining a buffer against the observed high-demand spikes (like P40 and P37) is prioritized to avoid stockouts, even at the risk of some ending inventory.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and occasional large spikes (e.g., 182 in P40, 143 in P47). The most recent regime, identified starting around Period 31, has a mean demand of approximately 111.9 units with a standard deviation of roughly 41.7. In the last 7 periods (P41-P47), the mean is slightly higher at 111.7, but because we are nearing the game's end (Period 48/50), maintaining a sufficient inventory buffer to capture these peaks is critical to avoid lost sales, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use recent_N with N=17 (spanning from Period 31 to 47) to capture the current mean and volatility level. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history, confirmed by all 'conclude' messages.

Daily Profit: $111.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period. Lead time remains consistently 0. The demand regime identified in Period 41 (starting at Period 31) persists, characterized by high volatility and frequent spikes. Reviewing recent data (P31-P48), the mean demand is approximately 110.1 and the standard deviation is 41.5. To maximize total reward in these final steps, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using these recent statistics (N=18). Since lead time is 0, the backend base stock simplifies to \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, and z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0. This means the OR engine will target the mean demand. However, the capping mechanism includes a safety buffer (\u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xb7\u03c3\u0302). Using recent_N=18 for both will capture the sustained high-volatility regime better than the long-term history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 31) is characterized by a mean demand of approximately 111.9 units and significantly high volatility (standard deviation ~43.3), with individual spikes as high as 182. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 49, demand dropped to 38, leaving 74 units on-hand. Since this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to maximize the final period's reward while minimizing ending inventory that incurs holding costs. However, given the high volatility and the frequency of demand exceeding current on-hand stock (74 units), an order is necessary to avoid stockouts. I will use the recent N (N=19, from Period 31 to 49) to capture the current high-volatility regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the observed lead time L=0.
