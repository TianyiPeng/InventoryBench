Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed now will arrive during this period's arrival phase to satisfy this period's demand. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Looking at historical data, the first period demand was 143. To be safe given the high initial demand seen in history and the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding cost ratio, I will order 150 units. This covers the high end of the historical sample while leaving a small buffer, as holding costs are significant ($1.0).",

Given P1 and P2 in-game were 38 and 103, and the next sample is 39, the demand is volatile.

The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals in P1, P2, and P3 (lead_time 0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 37 units.
