Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have a small initial sample of 5 periods of historical demand (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The mean is 93 and the standard deviation is approximately 38. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no previous history of arrivals yet to verify actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' to incorporate all 5 historical samples as the baseline for the opening period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1) based on a high target service level (safety factor z* based on $19 profit / $1 holding cost is ~0.95).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. The historical demand data provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) indicates a mean of approximately 93 units per period. However, Period 1 actual demand was only 3 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the provided samples. Since the promised lead time is 0 and the first order arrived immediately (lead_time 0 confirmed), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to account for the most recent observation (Period 1 demand of 3) while the OR backend integrates it with its logic, but I'll lean towards 'explicit' for mu_hat to bridge the gap between the sample mean (93) and the sudden low demand (3). Given the provided samples, I expect demand to revert toward the mean of ~90, but I must remain cautious of the P1 result.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 156 units. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for the first two periods confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals in P1 and P2 occurred the same period they were ordered). Demand in P1 (3) and P2 (17) has been quite low compared to the pre-game historical samples provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The average of the 5 pre-game samples is 93, while the game history average is 10. I will prioritize the more recent game history through EWMA to account for this apparent shift toward lower demand in the current environment while maintaining a buffer for the higher historical values. With lead time 0, mu_hat represents (1+0) * demand. I'll use EWMA with gamma 0.3 to weigh recent observations while respecting the higher historical mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1464.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 3 (very low), Period 2 was 17, and Period 3 was 81. Note that the historical demand data provided in the prompt (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) seems to represent a different context or global expectation, as the actual observed demand in the 'conclude' messages is significantly lower but rapidly increasing (3 -> 17 -> 81). Lead time is confirmed as 0 based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. On-hand inventory is 75. Given the sharp upward trend in demand, a conservative approach using a short window (recent_N=3) is appropriate to capture the momentum while acknowledging the variance. The profit/holding cost ratio is high ($19/$1), supporting a high service level goal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1797.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular): the promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times observed in Periods 1, 2, and 4 were indeed 0. Demand for the first five periods has been: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (Note: the prompt 'History' section shows different demand numbers than the 'Historical demand data' section; I will prioritize the 'Historical demand data' provided for the SKU as it explicitly lists Period 1-5). Mean demand = 93.0, Std Dev = 37.9. Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units) with 0 in-transit. Since lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period. To maximize reward, I need to set base stock to cover current period demand. Using all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the overall mean and volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2146.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 periods. Demand observations are: P1:3, P2:17, P3:81, P4:95, P5:114. There is a clear and sustained upward trend in demand as the product establishes itself or enters a peak season. The mean of the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is 96.67, significantly higher than the initial periods. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders placed in P1, P2, P4, and P5 all arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since demand is trending upwards, a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is selected for mu_hat to capture the current higher demand regime, rather than the lower historical average. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen during this growth phase. L remains at default (0) as it is consistently reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand has increased from an average of ~10 (P1-P2) to ~97 (P3-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 48 units. Demand has stabilization into a higher regime compared to the very beginning. Over the last 4 periods (P3-P6), demand values were 81, 95, 114, and 76, averaging 91.5 units per period. The user-provided historical data (P1-P5) and the concluding messages (P1-P6) show a discrepancy in demand values; however, looking at the 'Period conclude' messages specifically, the demand is significantly higher than the initial few periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use the last 4 periods (P3-P6) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand regime. N=4 is chosen based on the shift observed starting at Period 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3 confirmed: avg demand increased from ~10 (P1-P2) to ~91.5 (P3-P6). Lead time consistently observed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a clear regime shift after Period 2. Periods 1-2 averaged ~10 units, while Periods 3-7 averaged 88.6 units (81, 95, 114, 76, 77). The most recent 5 periods (P3-P7) represent the current demand profile. However, if we look even more closely at the last 2 periods, demand has stabilized around 76.5 units. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (all orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 arrived in the same period). Therefore, L=0 is maintained. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to represent current volatility accurately. Current on-hand is 43, and with mu_hat around 88.6 for the lead+review period (1+0=1), the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover this and order accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2044.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 3. Prior to Period 3, demand was low (<20), but from Period 3 onwards, it has stabilized at a much higher level. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 3 to Period 8 (6 samples) is 91.83 with a standard deviation of 15.54. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods (8/8 arrivals have been same-period). Given the current on-hand inventory of 8 units and the high demand (108 in Period 8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this higher-demand regime while excluding the initial low-demand noise. With L=0, the order base stock target will be calculated on approximately 1 period of demand (1+L=1).

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (P3-P8): mean ~92, std ~15.5. Lead time consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1641.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. From Period 3 to Period 9, the demand observations are: 81, 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88. This gives a mean of 91.3 and a standard deviation of 14.8. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments from Period 1 through Period 9 have arrived with an actual lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period X conclude' messages. Therefore, L=0 is the reliable lead time estimate. For \u03bc_hat, using the last 7 samples (P3-P9) provides the best estimate for the current high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, using the same window (N=7) captures the recent volatility. The base stock calculation in the OR backend will use these parameters to target a high service level (~95% given profit $19 and holding cost $1) while accounting for the zero lead time, effectively ordering enough to meet the expected demand for the current period minus on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 125, but we only had 117 units on-hand (starting 31 + ordered/arrived 86), resulting in 8 units of lost sales and 0 ending inventory. This indicates the current demand regime is slightly higher or more volatile than the previous estimate of 92 units. Looking at the regime starting from Period 3 (when demand spiked), the samples are: 81, 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125. The mean for these 8 periods is 95.5 with a standard deviation of 17.6. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this updated regime (P3-P10) to ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent stockout event and the higher average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P3-P10) mean increased slightly from 92 to 95.5 units; Period 10 recorded highest demand to date (125) leading to a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P3-P11) shows a clear shift compared to the initial two periods. The average demand in this period is approximately 96.8 units (871 units total / 9 periods), with a standard deviation of about 15.6. Period 10 experienced a stockout (125 demand), suggesting a need for a slightly higher safety stock buffer, especially since the lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 9 periods (the length of the current regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Setting L to the promised lead time of 0 (default) as historical data confirms same-period arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=9 to capture this higher demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P11 established: average demand 96.8 units, std 15.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 3 continues to be stable. The average demand for the segment P3-P12 (N=10) is 97.3 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive in the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. I am using recent_N=10 for all parameters to capture this specific regime effectively while excluding the low-demand outliers of Periods 1 and 2. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, and the OR engine's capped policy based on these parameters will ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover the expected demand and safety stock while considering the 44 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P12 confirmed: mean 97.3, std 16.5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 3 into a consistent regime. Analyzing demand from Period 3 to Period 13 (N=11), the mean demand is approximately 95.7 units (Sum: 1053 units / 11 periods). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire game history. The on-hand inventory is currently low (24 units), so I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable high-demand regime, ensuring the inventory level is sufficient to meet the expected mean demand plus a safety stock buffer determined by the OR engine's service level calculation (approx 95% based on profit/holding costs).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime established since Period 3. In Period 14, we observed a second stockout (demand 128, sold 123), following the stockout in Period 10. This indicates that while the mean is approximately 98 (P3-P14 average), the volatility is significant and the current inventory levels are occasionally insufficient to cover peaks. Starting Period 15 with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit requires an immediate order to cover Period 15 demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the demand is stable but shows occasional spikes (125 in P10, 128 in P14), I will use the recent regime (P3-P14, N=12) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation is based on current behavior rather than the low-demand first two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P14 confirmed: mean 98.4, std 17.1. High demand spikes (125, 128) have caused stockouts in P10 and P14, suggesting the need for slightly higher safety stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 3 continues to hold, with recent observations showing a slight upward trend in both mean and variance. The average demand from P3 to P15 is approximately 100 units (mean=100.08) with a standard deviation of approximately 17 units. Stockouts occurred in Period 10 (demand 125) and Period 14 (demand 128), and Period 15 also saw high demand (120). Given that lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the recent spikes and avoid stockouts while acknowledging the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the stable regime from P3-P15). This captures the current mean of ~100 and helps set a robust safety stock for the high service level required.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P15 stable with mean ~100 and std ~17; lead time remains 0 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. Analyzing the most recent data (P3-P16), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period with a standard deviation of about 17. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 31 units. Given a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering P3-P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while being responsive to the recent volatility that caused stockouts in Periods 10 and 14. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time remains strictly 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a regime starting around Period 3, but recent data shows a slight increase in both mean and variance. The average demand from Period 3 to Period 17 is approximately 97.8 units, with significant spikes (120+) causing stockouts in Periods 10 and 14. Period 17 showed a lower demand of 61, but given the volatility and previous stockouts, it is safer to maintain a forecast based on the established high-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering Period 3 to Period 17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this regime accurately while being responsive to the observed volatility. This helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for recent high-demand peaks, ensuring a sufficient service level against a holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P17: mean 97.8, with significant variance and peaks over 120. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 to Period 18 (N=16), the mean is approximately 96.8 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 20.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. In recent periods (P17 and P18), demand has been slightly lower (61 and 77), but high demand spikes (up to 128) have historically caused stockouts, so it is safer to maintain a forecast based on the longer regime (N=16) rather than just the most recent low-demand periods. I am setting L=0, mu_hat based on the last 16 periods to capture the post-shift regime, and sigma_hat also based on the last 16 periods to ensure a high service level given the $19 profit margin vs $1 holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. The demand regime starting from Period 3 remains stable with an average of approximately 96.5 units and a standard deviation of about 19.3. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, with the most recent arrival (Period 19) confirming this. The on-hand inventory is 35 units. The critical task is to set base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) high enough to cover periods with peaks (reaching ~128 units) while managing holding costs. Given the regime length from P3 to P19 (17 periods), I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the mean and variance of this current demand profile accurately. Profit is 19.0 and Holding Cost is 1.0, implying a high target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which the OR backend will calculate based on the provided sigma_hat.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the regime established around Period 3, but Period 20 recorded the highest demand yet at 147 units, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 18 periods (P3-P20), the average demand is 98.7 with a standard deviation of approximately 22.0, notably higher due to recent volatility. The lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), requiring robust safety stock to prevent frequent stockouts like those seen in P10, P14, and P20. I will use a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of the current regime while incorporating the increased variance from recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P3-P20: mean ~99, volatility increased (std ~22) following record high demand of 147 in Period 20; stockouts occurred when demand exceeded 125 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand dropped significantly to 46 units after a record high of 147 in Period 20, demonstrating high volatility. The long-term demand regime (since P3) has an average of approximately 97 units with a standard deviation of 22. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing this volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 19 periods (P3 to P21) for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time L will remain at the default (promised 0) as it is stable. This approach balances the need for safety stock against the risk of overstocking during demand dips like the one observed in Period 21.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime from Period 3 onwards. Analyzing the most recent data (P3-P22), the mean demand is approximately 97 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 24 units. The high volatility is driven by periodic spikes exceeding 120 units (notably P20 with 147 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in history. To optimize the base stock level given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required to avoid stockouts. I will use the recent N (N=20) method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, which includes early outliers. This ensures we cover the expected mean plus sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 3. However, demand in Period 23 reached a new record high of 169 units, resulting in a stockout. Previous peaks were 125, 128, and 147. This suggests either a further upward shift in mean demand or an increase in volatility. Calculating the demand statistics for the established period (P3-P23), the mean is approximately 100.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 26.5. Despite the lead time being 0, the stockout occurred because the OR backend's cap or the base stock calculation was insufficient to cover this massive spike. To ensure we capture these higher peaks (critical given the high profit/holding cost ratio of 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20 to cover the post-shift regime) to reflect the current mean and increased volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak of 169 in Period 23 confirms sustained high volatility; stockouts are occurring more frequently when demand exceeds 125 units. Demand regime (P3-P23) now shows mean ~101 and std ~26.5.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P3-P24) shows a volatile but high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of 26.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. In recent periods (P20, P23), demand has spiked significantly (147, 169), causing stockouts (fill rate issues) because the inventory level was insufficient to cover these tails. To minimize lost sales while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 (covering the sustained period from P3 to P24) to capture the current regime's volatility and mean. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (around 95%), which is appropriate given the frequency of recent demand spikes.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime starting around Period 3. Analysis of the recent 22 periods (P3-P25) shows an average demand of approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). We have experienced four stockouts (P10, P14, P20, P23) when demand exceeded available stock (typically around 125-135 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the optimal service level is 95%, which requires robust safety stock to handle the observed peaks (max demand 169). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=23 (covering the regime from P3 to the most recent sample in P25) to capture this sustained high mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased volatility seen in recent periods, specifically targeting a level that prevents stockouts during demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established since Period 3, characterized by a mean of approximately 101 units and high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 26.5), including recent peaks of 147 (P20) and 169 (P23). Current inventory is 63 units with zero in-transit. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To minimize the risk of stockouts during high demand spikes while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both Mean and Sigma based on the last 20 periods (N=20), which captures the relevant high-volatility regime (P7-P26). This allows the OR backend to calculate a service-level-optimized base stock that accounts for the observed variance and recent demand levels.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P3-P27) shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 101.4 and a standard deviation of 26.6. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, recent spikes (169 in P23, 145 in P27) and frequent stockouts when demand exceeds 125 units indicate that the OR engine needs to target a higher base stock to cover the upper tail of the distribution. By using 'recent_N' with N=25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will capture the properties of this post-shift regime (since P3) better than using the full history which includes the very low demand in P1-P2. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2153.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P23-P28) shows a continued high-volatility regime with demand values of 169, 110, 100, 82, 145, and 115. While the overall average since P3 is around 101, the variance is significant, and frequent spikes (145, 147, 169) continue to challenge the current stock levels. The mean of the last 6 periods is approximately 120, which is higher than the long-term average. To prevent stockouts during these peaks while maintaining a balanced inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this local trend of higher average demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to reflect the current high volatility (std deviation ~28 in this window). This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the observed 120-145 demand range without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; recent 6-period mean (P23-P28) is ~120 compared to the historical P3-P22 mean of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained shift towards higher volume and volatility. Since Period 23, the mean demand has stabilized around 120 units (P23-P29 mean is 121.3) compared to the previous regime of ~100. Furthermore, volatility has increased significantly, with peaks reaching 169. To avoid the frequent stockouts observed when demand exceeds 125 units (P10, P14, P20, P23, P27), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P23-P29) which capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover these new peaks. The lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for every order placed so far.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: avg increased from ~101 to ~121 (+20%), with significantly higher volatility (peaks of 145-169).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 23. While the average demand in this recent regime (P23-P30) is approximately 108.5, it is characterized by extremely high volatility (standard deviation ~37), with peaks as high as 169. The most recent demand samples (P29=93, P30=54) show a temporary softening, but given the critical stockout risks observed in earlier periods (P10, P14, P20, P23, P27) when demand spiked, we must maintain a robust base stock. The current on-hand inventory is 113. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 (the length of the current regime P23-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 23, with the average demand increasing to approximately 120 units and experiencing significant volatility (sigma approximately 35-40). Recent demand in Period 31 was 111. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the optimal service level is quite high (~95%), necessitating a safety stock that accounts for frequent peaks (up to 169). I am using a recent_N of 9 (P23-P31) to capture this higher-demand, high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat while maintaining responsive parameters. The lead time L is set to 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift at Period 23, characterized by higher mean (~110-120) and increased volatility (peaks reached 169). Recent demand (P24-P32) shows a mean of approximately 106 and a standard deviation of 26. Since Period 30, the demand has fluctuated between 54 and 111. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current volatility while acknowledging the most recent regime shift, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the high-peak periods (like P23 and P27) with the more moderate recent demand observations, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover demand spikes around 140-160 units while respecting the 'L=0' reality.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 (N=11) shows a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the earlier stages. Specifically, since P23, demand has averaged approximately 104 with a standard deviation of roughly 31. Recent periods (P30-P33) show a slight cooling from the extreme peaks seen earlier, but the possibility of spikes (like the 145-169 range) remains a risk given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1). The lead time is consistently 0. To capture the current regime characteristics while prioritizing the ability to meet high demand spikes (to avoid stockouts seen previously), I will use the last 11 samples (Period 23 to Period 33) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period range covers the entire 'high volatility' regime identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is characterized by a higher mean and increased volatility, with an average demand of approximately 107 units and several peaks exceeding 140. In the most recent 12 periods (P23-P34), the mean demand is 105.3 with a standard deviation of 30.5. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods across all historical data. I will use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility regime, ensuring the inventory level is sufficient to cover these frequent demand spikes (up to 169) and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 23 and 27. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0) warrants a higher service level, which the backend will provide based on these parameters.

The demand regime since Period 23 shows a higher mean and significant volatility (peaks of 145-169). Although there has been a slight cooldown in the last 6 periods (avg ~88), the overarching regime since P23 has an average mean of approximately 103 with a standard deviation around 26. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a desired service level of 95%, the OR backend should be configured to protect against the high-volatility peaks seen in the recent history. I will use the last 13 periods (P23-P35) to capture this high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume, high-volatility regime since Period 23. Analyzing the samples from Period 23 to Period 36 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 104.3 units with a standard deviation of 27.8. Although the 'conclude' message for Period 30 suggested an average of ~121, subsequent periods (30-36) have shown lower peaks, bringing the regime mean to a more sustainable level. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure adequate service levels given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95, which calls for high safety stock) and to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 23 and 27, I will use a 14-period window to capture this high-volatility regime for both demand (mu_hat) and risk (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2907.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a high-volatility regime since Period 23, with a mean around 101-120 units and significant peaks (e.g., 169 in P23, 167 in P37). The most recent demand (Period 37) of 167 units resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is optimal. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering the period since the volatility increased around P23) to capture the current high-demand environment and ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to prevent stockouts during these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand remains in a high-volatility regime (P23-P37) with frequent peaks exceeding 140 units; stockouts occurred in P23 and P37 despite consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-volatility regime that started around Period 23. Average demand for the last 16 periods (P23-P38) is approximately 107.5 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 31.8 units. The last two periods (P37 and P38) showed very high demand (167 and 150), leading to a stockout in P37. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.95, justifying a high service level. I am using recent_N (N=16) to capture this higher mean and volatility since the shift at P23. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The base stock level will target approximately 107.5 + 1.645 * 31.8 \u2248 160 units (actual calculation handled by OR backend).

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we observed a significant drop in demand (11 units), which is an outlier compared to the high-volatility regime identified starting at Period 23 (mean ~120). Despite this outlier, current on-hand inventory is 155 units. Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the priority remains avoiding stockouts during the frequent peaks (>140 units) seen in the current regime. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering P23 to P39) to incorporate the recent high-demand regime while including the latest outlier. For L and sigma_hat, 'calculate' and 'recent_N' will be used to reflect the stable 0-period lead time and the increased volatility of the current regime respectively.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 23. Period 40 saw a record demand of 182 units, leading to a stockout. The average demand since Period 23 is approximately 107 units, but recent spikes (167 in Period 37, 150 in Period 38, and 182 in Period 40) indicate that a wider safety margin is necessary to avoid frequent stockouts. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the increased mean and the significant volatility (standard deviation since Period 23 is approximately 38), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the current regime from P23-P40) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat value of 45 to provide extra protection against these increasing demand peaks, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P40: Average 107.5, but volatility has increased significantly with peaks reaching 182 units; stockouts are frequent when demand exceeds 150 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 23. While the average demand from P23 to P41 is approximately 107.5 units, recent peaks have significantly increased (e.g., 182 units in Period 40). Frequent stockouts (P37, P40) occur when demand exceeds 150 units, indicating that the base stock needs to account for these extreme tails to protect the $19 profit margin against a $1 holding cost (critical ratio ~0.95). In Period 41, demand was 149 units, further confirming this elevated level. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. To address the recent volatility and higher peaks, I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand distribution (P32-P41), which includes the high-demand spikes and the recent average shift, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a confirmed regime shift at Period 23. While the long-term average since Period 23 is approximately 110 units, the most recent demand points (P37-P42: 167, 150, 11, 182, 149, 87) highlight extreme swings, including a record high of 182 and a sharp drop to 11. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and frequent stockouts when demand spikes above 150, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-shift average (P23-P42), which is approximately 110.8 units. I am setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the increased standard deviation (approx 44 units) observed in this high-volatility regime. This should provide sufficient safety stock to cover potential peaks near 180 units while balancing holding costs given the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with a recent mean (P23-P43) of approximately 110 units and a standard deviation around 35. Period 40 saw a record demand of 182 which resulted in a stockout. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a service level (q) of 0.95 is appropriate, requiring robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the higher volatility observed in the current regime (P23 onwards), I'm using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Following the Period 43 conclude message, the current on-hand inventory is 63 units. The OR backend will calculate a base_stock targeting approximately 165-175 units to cover the 0-period lead time plus the high-demand peaks, resulting in an order of roughly 100-110 units for Period 44.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 23. While the recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is approximately 126.4 units (significantly influenced by the 182 peak in P40), the broader regime (P23-P44) shows a mean of ~108.7 units with a standard deviation of ~38.0. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during demand spikes like those seen in Period 40 (182 units) and Period 37 (167 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 21 periods (N=21) to capture this higher volatility regime while smoothing out the extreme P40 outlier. The critical ratio (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1)) is ~0.95, justifying a robust safety stock to cover demand peaks. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in the high-volatility regime identified around Period 23. Since the last major update in Period 41, demand has fluctuated significantly (87, 117, 97, 76), but remains within the established range. The mean for the recent regime (P23-P45) is approximately 107.4 with a standard deviation of 36.4, reflecting the impact of several large spikes (max 182). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To minimize stockout risk while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=23) for mean demand and an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts during peak demand periods. With profit at $19 and holding cost at $1, the target service level is high (~95%), justifying this slightly conservative safety stock approach.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2085.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a persistent 0-period lead time. Since Period 23, we have entered a higher-demand regime where average demand is approximately 110 units, but with frequent and significant spikes exceeding 150-180 units (e.g., P37: 167, P38: 150, P40: 182, P41: 149). While the most recent few periods (P42-P46) have stabilized slightly with a mean of ~98, the volatility remains the primary risk to stockouts. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the OR backend's service level target is naturally high (~95%). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=24 to capture the entire high-regime period starting at P23, ensuring the base stock level reflects both the current mean (~110) and the historical spikes. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=24 to accurately capture the standard deviation of this volatile regime, helping the OR engine maintain sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts during future peaks while inventory is currently at 62 units.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2687.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a confirmed regime shift around Period 23. In the most recent block (Periods 41-47), the mean demand is approximately 113.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25.5 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is high (0.95), necessitating a responsive safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand peaks (e.g., Period 47 reached 143 units). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current high-volatility regime (P28-P47) while smoothing out extreme single-period outliers like Period 40's demand of 182. L will remain 'default' as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime (P41-P47) maintains a mean of ~113 with high volatility (std ~25). Stockouts remain a risk when demand exceeds 140-150 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2306.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime since Period 41, with an average demand of approximately 113.3 units and a standard deviation of 26.3. The most recent demand (P48) was 124 units, consistent with this regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are sold within the same period. The Critical service level (q) is 0.95 (19 / (19+1)), which justifies a high safety stock to prevent frequent stockouts observed in the past when demand exceeded 140-150 units. To balance this, I will use recent_N (N=8, covering P41-P48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~113) and volatility (~26) accurately, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Daily Profit: $722.00, Daily Holding Cost: $118.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $604.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a somewhat inconsistent mean since Period 41. Recent demand (P41-P49) has averaged approximately 105 units, but with a significant standard deviation and individual peaks reaching nearly 150 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. To capture the most recent behavior while providing enough buffer for the high-demand spikes (like the 143 in P47 and 124 in P48), I am using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower demand of 38 in P49 with the preceding higher demand periods, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these fluctuations without excessive inventory.
