Based on the historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5 from a previous context or prior samples), the average demand is approximately 93 units (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in time to meet this period's demand (Arrival Resolution happens before Demand Resolution). To maximize reward while accounting for demand variability (ranging from 39 to 143), I will target an inventory level that covers a high-end demand scenario.

Historical data provided in the prompt shows significantly higher demand for the first few periods (P1: 143, P2: 103) compared to the 'Game History' observation (P1 demand: 3). This suggests the historical samples might represent a different demand regime or the 'Game History' reflects a slow start. However, the objective is to maximize reward. Given the promised lead time of 0 and the confirmed lead time of 0, I can use a 'just-in-time' approach. Current on-hand inventory is 147 units. The historical average demand is around 93 units per period. 147 units are likely sufficient to cover Period 2 demand even if it returns to historical levels (103 units). To avoid unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit) while maintaining a buffer, I will not place an order this period.

I must reconcile the discrepancy: the 'Historical Demand Data' likely represents broader market potential or a different venue context, while the game history shows actual realized demand. Since lead time is 0, I can be reactive. Current on-hand is 130. Based on game history (avg 10/period), 130 is more than enough for the current period's demand. However, if realized demand shifts toward the historical average of ~93, I may need inventory. Since there's no penalty for ordering in a LT=0 environment, I will wait until on-hand levels drop further to avoid holding costs, as current stock (130) covers even the highest historical sample (143) when combined with a same-period order if needed in the future.
