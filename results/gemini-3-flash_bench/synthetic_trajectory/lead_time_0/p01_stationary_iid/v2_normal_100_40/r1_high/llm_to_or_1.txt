Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 1, we have no history of demand or arrivals beyond the initial seed samples. The product is 'chips(Regular)' which typically has stable demand unless influenced by promotion or holidays. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, we need to place an order immediately. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand points (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), the mean is 93. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will calculate statistics based on these samples to establish a baseline. Given lead time L=0, the backend will target a base stock level covering the current period's demand. I will use default for L as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift.

=== Period 1 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $604.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 38 units, which is significantly lower than the historical sample provided for Period 1 (143). The order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Given the inventory level of 118 and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level. Since we only have one period of actual game history which differs from the provided 'historical samples', I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to balance the historical context (5 samples) with the immediate observation, while maintaining the L=0 expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1935.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 22 units. Looking at the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period). The demand for the first two periods was 38 and 103 (average 70.5). Using all 5 historical samples provided in the prompt (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), the mean demand is 93. I will set the lead time to the promised value (0). For mu_hat, I will use a conservative estimate based on the historical mean of all 5 available samples (93 per period). Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*93 = 93. For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of all samples to account for the volatility seen (range 39 to 143).

Daily Profit: $1577.00, Daily Holding Cost: $66.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1511.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 38 (calculated from starting on-hand + arrived - ending on-hand: 156-118=38), Period 2 was 103, and Period 3 was 83. The prompt also provided samples for Periods 1-5 (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), which conflict slightly with the 'conclude' messages in terms of Period 1 and 3 values. I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages for identifying the current state but utilize the general distribution of the samples (Mean ~93, Std ~38). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Current on-hand is 66, and demand is occurring after the decision. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover the current period's demand. Given the volatility (CV ~ 0.4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (38, 103, 83) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at default (0).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $130.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-4 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 130. Historical demand samples are 38, 103, 83, and 0 (mean = 56, std \u2248 46). Note that the 'Game History' demand mentions 0 for Period 4, while the 'Historical Demand Data' provides 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. Reconciling these: the Environment Snapshot data likely represents a different sequence/ground truth than the specific P1-P4 history provided. Using the history specific to P1-P4, the demand is highly volatile (0 to 103). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent behavior for the OR backend to calculate base stock. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std based on these 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $2508.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, demand was 152 while only 132 units were available, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The past five periods show highly volatile demand (38, 103, 83, 0, 152), with an average of approximately 75.2 units per period. The realized lead time to date has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. To prevent future stockouts given the recent demand spike and current zero inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full range of recent volatility. The L parameter remains at 'default' (0) as all orders have arrived same-period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the high demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2348.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand was 126, while the 5-period average (excluding the outlier in P4) is approximately 101. Historical samples provided show high volatility (samples: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Period 4 was a significant outlier with 0 demand. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand is low (46 units) relative to recent demand (126, 152), I need to set parameters to ensure high availability. I will use the last 6 periods of game history to calculate the mean and standard deviation, as this includes both high and low demand periods, providing a more balanced view than the long-term historical samples alone. $q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95$, suggesting a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $843.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (Periods 1-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods consistently. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility, with recent values: P1:38, P2:103, P3:83, P4:0, P5:152, P6:126, P7:51. The mean demand over 7 periods is approximately 79. Since the product is chips (a frequent purchase item) and there's no specific calendar indicator for a shift, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility. In P5, there was a stockout (demand 152 vs on-hand 132), indicating we were under-stocked; however, in P7, ending inventory was 126. With Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting the OR engine should aim for a high service level. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent volatility (the P4-P6 swing) more heavily than the initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand data for Period 1 to 8 shows a fairly stable but volatile pattern (38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85). I will also incorporate the pre-game samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The average across all 13 demand points is approximately 85 units. In Period 5, there was a stockout (demand 152, sold 132), indicating the backend's base-stock calculation was slightly under-buffered. The observed actual lead time from Period 1 to 8 has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will stick with the default (promised) lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default method) to capture the full variance, as there is no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet (the 0 in P4 and 152 in P5 represent outliers/high volatility rather than a trend).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1142.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the project state shows an on-hand inventory of 93 units with zero in-transit. Analyzing the historical demand from Period 1 to Period 9 (38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65), the mean demand is approximately 78.1 units. There is significant volatility, particularly Period 4 (demand 0) and Period 5 (demand 152). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded cycles. Since Period 4 and 5 represent a significant swing, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent demand profile (avg: 95.8) which includes these fluctuations. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base-stock level suitable for a 95% service level (~$19/($19+$1) = 0.95 quantile), which should build a sufficient buffer given the lead time of 0 and the current on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently observed across all 10 completed periods. Demand has shown significant volatility, ranging from 0 to 152. Recently, demand in Period 10 was very low (6 units). Looking at the full history of demand (38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65, 6), the mean is approximately 71 units with a high standard deviation. Since the lead time is 0, the target is to cover demand for the current period (L+1=1). I will use the default method for lead time as it is stable at 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) as there isn't a clear sustained regime shift yet, only high variance inherent to the product. The backend will calculate the base stock to achieve a high service level (profit ~$19, holding ~$1 equates to a ~95% service level).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 concluded periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent demands being 65 (P9), 6 (P10), and 115 (P11). The initial provided samples (P1-P5) and the 11-period history show no clear seasonal pattern due to the generic date labels, but the demand mean across the 11 concluded periods is approximately 75 units, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11) is 64.4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent mean shifts while providing sufficient smoothing against the high variance (e.g., the drop in P10). Standard deviation (sigma_hat) will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to better reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory for chips(Regular) is 38 units with 0 in-transit. Analyzing the historical demand from Period 1 to Period 12 (38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65, 6, 115, 94), the average demand is approximately 76.58 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded orders. Given the high volatility in demand (ranging from 0 to 152), using a broader sample size for mean and variance estimation is appropriate to capture the full distribution. My parameters set L=0 based on historical evidence. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to incorporate all available performance history for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base-stock level accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this unit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU experienced a stockout (demand 172 vs 154 units on-hand), leaving zero ending inventory for Period 14. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand exhibits significant variability (ranging from 0 to 172). To ensure high availability and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent demand statistics. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) is 90.4 units, while the full history mean (Periods 1-13) is approximately 83.8 units. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will allow the OR backend to prioritize the most recent (and higher) demand signals. With L=0, mu_hat becomes (1+0)*mean=90.4 and sigma_hat becomes sqrt(1)*std. This configuration should result in a base stock calculated to cover the expected demand of Period 14 plus a safety buffer based on recent high volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals across 14 periods. Demand for the last 14 periods has been quite volatile, ranging from 0 to 172 units, with an average of approximately 86 units per period. Recently (Period 13 and 14), demand has spiked to 172 and 114 respectively, following a period of 94. Because the product reached zero inventory in Period 13 due to high demand (172), I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to better capture the current volatility and slightly higher demand trend. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent high-demand peaks while maintaining the 95% service level logic for profit maximization ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1440.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed cycles. The demand history shows moderate volatility but lacks a clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift based on the provided generic period dates. The average demand across all 15 completed periods is approximately 85.7 units per period. Specifically, the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) show a slightly higher mean of approximately 115.4 units, though this is heavily influenced by a high demand of 172 in Period 13. Given the current on-hand inventory of 118 units and a lead time of 0, we want to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period with a high service level, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the overall demand characteristics while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. For lead time, 'default' is selected as it matches the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (15 out of 16 periods, with no shipments lost). Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variability but no clear sustained regime shift. Average demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 80.4 units. Period 16 demand was 80, very close to the mean. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend OR logic will target the base stock for a single period (1+L=1). I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the overall mean and variance while filtering out the initial seed data provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5 in the 'Historical Demand Data' section differ slightly from 'Game History'), as the Game History is the ground truth for the current simulation environment.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since the game's inception, with no clear evidence of seasonal shifts or structural regime changes. The average demand across all periods is approximately 87.7 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently at 87 units on-hand. I will use the 'default' parameter settings, which calculate the mean and standard deviation based on all available samples. This provides a robust base-stock level that balances the profit margin of $19.0 against the $1.0 holding cost, targeting a high service level (~95%) given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with on-hand inventory at 10 and zero in-transit. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The demand over the last 18 periods has been volatile, ranging from 0 to 172. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has an average of 100 units (82, 80, 76, 148, and the implicit demand reflected in Period 12-18). Specifically, the last 7 periods (P12-P18) show a mean demand of approximately 109.4 units per period. I'll use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). Setting method to 'calculate' for lead time since historical data confirms L=0 consistently. The logic is to set a base stock that covers the expected demand in Period 19 plus a safety buffer given the high profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean. Comparing the last 10 periods (P10-P19: 6, 115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80, 76, 148, 41) gives an average demand of 92.8, which is slightly higher than the overall average of ~86.7 across all 19 periods. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), requiring us to capture recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and its standard deviation, while maintaining lead time 'L' as 'default' since it hasn't deviated from 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2467.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility since Period 1, with a mean demand of approximately 91 units over 20 periods. The lead time has consistently remained at 0, which simplifies the inventory management as orders arrive within the same period. In the last three periods (18-20), we observed demand values of 148, 41, and 132 respectively, indicating high variability. The ending on-hand inventory is 41 units. To maintain a high service level while managing this volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since lead time has always been 0, I will use 'default' for L. This setup ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance recorded in the full history while effectively responding to the most recent demand behavior.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistent throughout the first 21 periods, ranging from 0 to 172 units. The delivery lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed (with the exception of Period 11 where no order was placed). Based on the historical demand samples (including the initial 5 and the 21 game history periods), the mean demand is approximately 84 units with a standard deviation around 45 units. Since there are no clear changepoints or seasonal indicators in the provided generic dates (Period_1 through Period_21), I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full distribution of demand, and the default method for lead time as the 0-period promised lead time holds true.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with no clear seasonal trend identifiable from the generic period numbering. Recent demand samples (Periods 18-22) are 148, 41, 132, 53, and 123, yielding a mean of 99.4, which is slightly higher than the overall average of all 22 samples (~89). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture recent demand levels while smoothing out individual period spikes. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=10) to better reflect current volatility. The target service level derived from the backend (Profit $19 / Holding $1) is approximately 95% (q = 19/20), which is appropriate for a high-margin product like chips.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a fairly stable distribution without significant regime shifts or seasonal trends in the historical data (Periods 1-23). The average demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 14-23) is approximately 97.3 units, compared to the overall average of 88.6 units. To capture current variability while maintaining stability, I will use a recent window of N=10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This balances the need to be responsive to recent demand levels while smoothing out period-to-period noise. Since the lead time is consistently 0, L is set to 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1289.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 24 periods, with an overall mean of approximately 88 units. However, looking at the recent history (Periods 15-24), the mean demand is slightly lower at 83.9 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since on-hand inventory is currently 79 units and there are no units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand distribution and ensure sufficient stock for the next cycle (L+1=1). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a higher service level, which the OR backend will naturally achieve through the base stock calculation.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) has been somewhat volatile but relatively stable in its overall mean. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 88.5, which is close to the long-term average (87.2). I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand level and its associated volatility. This period (Period 26) begins with 56 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. By using recent_N=10, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that aims for a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 quantile), which should result in an order that replenishes inventory to handle the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with a mean around 87-90 units and a standard deviation around 40-45 units. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 12), demand has averaged approximately 95 units per period. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly higher recent average and volatility while smoothing out point-specific noise. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (95%), meaning we should maintain sufficient stock to cover the forecast mean plus roughly 1.64 standard deviations. Current on-hand is low (14), so the OR backend will place an order to reach the calculated base stock for Period 27.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears to be in a stable regime with a mean of approximately 88.5 units based on the last 20 periods (P8-P27). Looking at more recent data (last 10 periods), the mean is 85.1 and the standard deviation is 28.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%, I will use a window of the last 15 periods to capture sufficient variance while staying responsive to the current trend. This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR backend (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) maintains high availability for this high-margin SKU.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears reasonably stable without clear seasonal trends in the provided period numbering. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently observed as 0 in history (e.g., Period 28 order arrived in Period 28), I will maintain L=0. In the last 10 periods (P19-P28), demand has averaged approximately 86 units, which is slightly higher than the overall average but consistent with the recent variance. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough sample size to buffer against the observed volatility (demand range ~40 to 132). Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1378.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without strong evidence of a recent regime shift. The mean demand over all samples (P1-P29) is approximately 89 units per period. Evaluating the last 10 periods (P20-P29) shows a mean of 88.9, which is consistent with the long-term average. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been perfectly consistent throughout the history, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current variability and mean demand accurately while adhering to recent trends, which ensures the base stock reflects the current volatility of ~30-40 units observed in the recent window. This approach maintains a high service level for a 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding over-stocking.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 30 periods, with a few fluctuations but no sustained regime shift. The most recent demand (Period 30) was 115, following 76 and 94. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 90.1 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low at 23 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean while ensuring the base stock covers the target service level (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95). L is set to lead_time=0 as confirmed by the history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 49 units. Examining the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) has stayed relatively stable without clear seasonal trends or major regime shifts over the 31 periods. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is 93.2 units, while the overall average is 88.5 units. Given the consistency and lack of recent spikes, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on current demand levels (average ~93 per period) while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 0-period lead time environment. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern with no significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes identifiable from the provided sequence. The average demand across all 32 periods is approximately 89 units, with recent periods (P28-P32) averaging 94 units. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 30 units, which is below the average single-period demand. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture mid-term stability and 'default' for lead time since 0-period arrival is reliably confirmed.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with no clear evidence of a significant regime shift in the recent windows. Based on the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is approximately 94 units per period with a standard deviation of around 19 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Since Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the backend will treat mu_hat as (1+0)*mean. This approach balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1) by maintaining a base stock level that covers immediate demand plus a safety margin based on recent volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 20 periods with a mean of approximately 92.5 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use a 20-period lookback window (recent_N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while filtering out the early volatility seen in the first 10 periods (e.g., the very low demand in Period 10 or zero demand in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 37, which is below the average single-period demand, necessitating a replenishment order. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a moderate increase in mean and volatility over the last 10 periods (avg ~101) compared to the long-term average (avg ~90). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), necessitating a significant order this period to maintain service levels. I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand and slightly higher volatility, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the most current environment while maintaining the high service level indicated by the profit/holding cost ratio (95%).

Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 36 (11 samples), the mean demand is approximately 97.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the earlier average. Specifically, the last 11 periods of demand were: 132, 74, 94, 76, 115, 84, 101, 97, 88, 135, and 80. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine needs to maintain a high service level. I am setting N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time of 0 perfectly matches the promised lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift starting around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 37, the mean demand is approximately 98.3, which is significantly higher than the earlier average of ~85. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages where orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To account for this higher demand regime while maintaining a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean and volatility observed since the shift at Period 26. Lead time L will be set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a transition around Period 26. Analyzing the average demand from Period 26 to Period 38 (13 samples), the mean is approximately 93.4 units, which is a noticeable increase from the earlier average of approximately 82 units. Recent periods (P34-P38: 88, 135, 80, 84, 55) show higher volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%, the system must be responsive to these shifts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer regime's mean and variability while providing enough sample history for stability. Lead time is consistently 0, so L=default (0) and calculate are appropriate; I'll use default. Period 38 demand was lower (55), but given the preceding 135 and the established regime shift, N=13 balances the recent trend effectively.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 39 (14 samples), the mean is approximately 95, with a standard deviation around 22. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 118, which is slightly above this average but within the expected volatility. The carry-over insight from period 36 regarding a regime shift is well-supported. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to the most recent 'conclude' message. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will calculate a high service level (0.95 quantile), which is appropriate for this SKU. I will use recent_N with N=14 to reflect the current demand regime and its volatility while maintaining 0-period lead time parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand increased from ~80 to ~95 units (+18.7%).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P26-P40), the mean demand is approximately 98.2 units (sum=1473), compared to the earlier average of ~81 units. The standard deviation over this same recent window is approximately 22.4. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times consistently show 0 periods, I will maintain L=0. I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the inventory levels remain responsive to the ~20% increase in demand while accounting for recent stockouts (Period 40).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher average since Period 26, approximately 95 units per period. In the most recent periods (P30-P41), demand has been somewhat volatile (ranging from 55 to 138), but the mean remains significantly higher than the initial periods. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows orders arriving in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since Period 26, we have 16 samples. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=16 to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. The on-hand inventory is 77, and there is no pipeline inventory. By using the recent 16 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected 95+ units of demand for the current period (L+1=1), adjusted for the 95% service level desired given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (q = 0.95).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 26) shows an average demand of approximately 96.6 units (calculated from Period 26-42), which is higher than the early-game average. The most recent demand (Period 42) was 107. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals. I will use recent_N with N=17 (the length of the current regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the increased mean and volatility since the shift. This ensures the OR engine's base_stock targets the higher demand level while accounting for the standard deviation observed in this higher-volume period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a higher regime since Period 26. Analyzing the last 18 periods (P26-P43), the average demand is approximately 100 units/period, compared to the earlier historical average of ~80. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this sustained higher demand level and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment, maintaining a high service level (calculated as 0.95 by the engine given the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) while minimizing stockouts, which occurred in Period 43. Current on-hand is 0, so the engine will place an order to reach the target base stock immediately.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 44 (the last 19 periods), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units, confirming earlier carry-over insights. Recent demand has shown some volatility, with a spike to 144 in Period 43 followed by 94 in Period 44. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (all orders arriving in the same period), I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the behavior of the current regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current average demand (~101) and its corresponding variability, allowing the OR backend to maintain a sufficient service level for this high-margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) item.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in the higher regime established around Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 101 units per period (N=20). The standard deviation for this same period (P26-P45) is approximately 25 units. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (all recent orders P40-P45 arrived in the same period). The OR backend uses a calculation based on profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to target a service level of 95% (19/(19+1)=0.95). I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sustained 'high' regime while filtering out the lower demand noise from the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2354.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift starting around Period 26, which was previously noted in the carry-over insights. Recent demand specifically from Period 40 to 46 (last 7 periods) shows a mean of approximately 115.9 (62, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125, plus P40's 138), which is higher than the previous regime of ~95. Using N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations balances the recent high-demand periods against the broader post-Period 26 context, identifying a stable but higher average and variance. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, so method 'default' is appropriate. The service level target (z-score) derived from the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) is high (approx. 95%), so identifying the correct mu and sigma is vital to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: average demand increased from ~95 to ~116 (+22%) over the last 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1013.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, most recently at Period 40, where the average demand increased to approximately 116 units. However, looking at the last 8 periods (P40-P47), the demand values are [138, 62, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125, 58], which averages to 108.6. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (ordered in N, arrived in N). With L=0, the base stock serves to cover only the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-mean regime that started around Period 40. The current on-hand inventory is 89. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx. 95%), which is appropriate given the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 40, 43, and 45. Setting N=8 focuses the forecast on the most recent behavior which appears distinctly more variable than previous regimes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several shifts, notably around Period 26 and most recently at Period 40. Since Period 40, demand has averaged approximately 110 units (Periods 40-48 excluding P40 stockout impact: 62, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125, 58, 75). In the most recent 3 periods (46-48), demand has been 125, 58, and 75, which is lower than the previous sub-regime but maintains high volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 91 units and account for the high volatility observed in the Period 40-48 regime (mean ~105, std ~32), I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean and volatility since the last confirmed shift. This ensures the base stock calculation (for L=0) covers the upcoming period's demand with an appropriate safety buffer for the 95% service level mandated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1098.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 40-49) suggests a high-mean, high-variance regime. From Period 40 to 49, the average demand is approximately 100.7 units, but this includes a quieter stretch in the last three periods (58, 75, 63). However, the preceding periods (40-46) showed several spikes (138, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125). Given the item is 'chips(Regular)' at Period 50, I am anticipating potential volatility or sustained high demand. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this latest regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. My parameters focus on maintaining high service levels (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1) while accounting for the recent higher volatility in demand.
