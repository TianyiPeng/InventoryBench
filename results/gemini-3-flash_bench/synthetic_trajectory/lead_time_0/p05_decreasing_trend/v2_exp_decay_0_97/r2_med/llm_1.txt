The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1's expected demand plus a safety margin to prevent stockouts if demand hits the upper bound of the historical range. Based on the history [187, 189, 158, 158, 184], demand is relatively stable but shows variance. To maximize reward while considering the $1 holding cost, I will target approximately 200 units. This covers the maximum historical demand (189) plus a small buffer, ensuring I don't lose $4 in profit per unit missed, even if it costs $1 per unit held.

{
  "rationale": "The game is now in Period 50, which is the final period of the simulation. In the final period, any inventory remaining at the end of the period is charged a holding cost without providing any future opportunity for sales or profit. Therefore, the objective for the final decision is to meet expected demand as accurately as possible while ensuring ending inventory is zero. Reviewing recent demand history (P45-P49: 34, 29, 76, 37, 70), the 5-period average is 49.2, but the pattern is highly volatile. P49 saw a demand of 70, exhausting all available inventory. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning any order placed now will arrive and be available for P50 demand. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must order exactly what I expect demand to be. Given the high volatility but the need to avoid overstocking in the final step, I will target the recent high-end demand level (~70) to capture sales, as the profit margin ($4) significantly outweighs the potential holding cost ($1) if demand is slightly lower, while acknowledging this is the last chance to earn reward.",
