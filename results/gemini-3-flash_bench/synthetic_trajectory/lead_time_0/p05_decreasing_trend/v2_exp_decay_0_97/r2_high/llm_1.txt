Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 of previous data) show a mean of approximately 175 units per period (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). For 'chips(Regular)', demand appears relatively stable. Given a lead time of 0, the order I place now will arrive during this period and be available to meet Period 1's demand.
