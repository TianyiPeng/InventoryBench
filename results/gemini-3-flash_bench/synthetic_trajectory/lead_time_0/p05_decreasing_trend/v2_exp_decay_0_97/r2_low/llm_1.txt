  "rationale": "This is Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack with relatively steady but moderately high historical demand (Mean: 175.2, SD: 15.6 based on provided history). There are no specific calendar dates provided, so I will rely on the historical average. With a promised lead time of 0 (same-period arrival), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Since demand resolution happens after my decision and arrival, and there is no starting inventory, I must order at least the expected demand plus a safety margin to avoid stockouts. Given high holding costs ($1/unit/period) equal to profit ($1/unit), I must be careful not to overstock significantly. I'll target slightly above the historical mean to ensure availability while minimizing potential waste.",

Based on the 5 historical samples provided (avg 175) and the recent Period 1 demand (218), the demand seems to be on the higher end of the distribution. For Period 2, I need to cover the expected demand. Given the stockout, I will target a slightly higher quantity to capture potential growth or variance. I will forecast demand around 210-220 units.
