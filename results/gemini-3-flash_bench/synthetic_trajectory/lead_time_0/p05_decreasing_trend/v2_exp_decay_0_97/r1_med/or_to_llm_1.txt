With 49 on-hand, an order of 61 units (the same as last period) or slightly more is sensible.

A balanced strategy is needed: we must restock to capture potential sustained higher demand following the P30 spike without over-committing to the old mean. I will set a target inventory level of approximately 140 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and lead time is 0, the order quantity equals the target level.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time analysis: Confirmed at 0 periods throughout the game (e.g., P45 order arrived P45). Inventory analysis: Current on-hand is 92 units. Demand analysis: Demand has entered an extremely low and volatile regime. Period 44 (8 units), Period 45 (45 units), Period 46 (16 units), and Period 47 (7 units) show an average of only 19 units per period. The 92 units on-hand are sufficient to cover over 4 periods of demand at this rate. Strategy: With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and already holding 92 units, any additional ordering will likely result in excess inventory and high holding costs. The OR recommendation of 66 units is too high because it calculates stock based on a longer history that includes much higher demand levels (early periods were >150 units). To maximize final reward, I will order 0 units and deplete the existing inventory.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: History from Period 1 to 45 consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand analysis: The OR baseline recommends 105 units based on long-term historical averages. However, demand has been in a significant downward regime for several dozen periods. The most recent demand samples are 31, 8, 45, 16, 7, and 40 (P43-P48). The average of the last six periods is approximately 25 units. Starting on-hand inventory is 52 units, which already covers twice the recent average demand. Ordering the OR-recommended 105 units would likely lead to excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit), especially with only 2 periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50). To maximize profit while avoiding stockouts, I will target a total availability of roughly 60-70 units. With 52 on hand, an order of 15 units brings the total to 67 units, providing a safety buffer for the current period's demand while minimizing ending inventory.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downward regime shifts throughout the sequence. Originally averaging ~175 units (P1-P9), the recent 6 periods (P44-P49) have averaged only 23.5 units, with the latest demand at 25. The OR recommendation of 114 units is significantly overestimating demand because it uses the entire historical sample, which includes the much higher initial periods. Given the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period), the goal is to maintain a stock level that covers one period of demand with a safety buffer for volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 42 units. If I expect demand to remain in the 20-40 range, 42 units is already sufficient or nearly sufficient. Ordering an additional 114 units would result in excessive holding costs. I will adjust the order to 0 to burn through the excess inventory, as 42 units covers almost twice the recent average demand and the 0-day lead time allows for immediate replenishment in the next period if demand spikes.",
