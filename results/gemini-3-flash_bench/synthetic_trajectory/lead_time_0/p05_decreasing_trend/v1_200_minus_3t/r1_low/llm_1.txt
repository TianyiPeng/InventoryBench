Based on the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 which seem to be provided as training/prior data), the demand for this SKU ranges from 131 to 217, with an average of approximately 182 units. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 will arrive and be available to satisfy demand in Period 1. There is currently 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. To maximize reward, I must order enough to cover Period 1's expected demand plus a small buffer, while being mindful that holding costs are equal to the profit ($1.0), making overstocking as costly as understocking.
