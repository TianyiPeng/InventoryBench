Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips (Regular)' with a profit and holding cost both at $1.0/unit. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185. The average demand is 182 and the standard deviation is 34.7. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we have no historical lead time data yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while excluding potential earlier noise, setting our baseline for the first decision. Given profit=holding_cost, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will be close to the mean demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 182 units based on a lead time of 0. The shipment arrived promptly (lead_time=0 confirmed), but demand was 217 units, resulting in 35 lost sales. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The historical demand data (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) shows a mean of 182. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (0.5 service level). I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time since the first period confirmed the promised L=0. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture all available historical samples to stabilize the mean forecast against the high demand seen in Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the promised lead time of 0 is being met (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). However, realized demand in Periods 1 and 2 (217 and 213) has consistently exceeded the orders generated by the initial default parameters (182), leading to stockouts and lost profits. The historical data provided (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) suggests a mean demand around 182, but recent actual demand is significantly higher (~215). To prevent further stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this upward shift in the most recent periods, while maintaining the L=0 lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. Historical demand for the first three periods was 217, 213, and 163 (Mean = 197.6, Std Dev = 29.9). In Period 3, we finally saw an ending inventory of 42 units, providing a buffer. However, initial inventory was depleted in Periods 1 and 2, suggesting we were under-ordering relative to demand spikes. Since L=0, we are managing a Base Stock level for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility while acknowledging the downward trend in demand (217 -> 213 -> 163). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 1-period demand expectation plus a safety factor derived from the observed standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period (P1-P4). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility across the first 5 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, and the P5 sample of 185). The current mean is approximately 192 units. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (17 units) and there are no units in-transit. I will use the 'default' method for lead time to maintain the observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent regime while smoothing out the high period-to-period variance. This ensures the base stock reflects the current historical average and dispersion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some variability but generally centers around a mean of ~182 units (calculated from Period 1-5 demand: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177). The standard deviation across these periods is approximately 22. Given that the lead time is 0 (one-period coverage), the base stock calculation targets (1+L) periods. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which maps to z=0 (the mean). The OR backend's safety stock logic using z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 will thus primarily order to the mean of demand unless I adjust parameters. Since periods 1-2 saw stockouts (sold < demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history and ensure the mean reflects current consumption, while setting lead time to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 0-period performance.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is currently 0 with no items in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 189 units per period (217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193). The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with the game history, every order placed has arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. Currently, the system has experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in periods 1, 2, and 6. To ensure better service levels while accounting for the recent demand volatility, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (all observed periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This uses the recent demand regime to set the order level for Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with no units in-transit. Over the first 7 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 191 units (averaging all historical samples: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202). Specifically, recent demand in periods 6 and 7 (193 and 202) suggests a slight upward trend or return to the initial high levels seen in periods 1 and 2. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level q = 0.5, which sets the base stock at the mean demand. However, to avoid stockouts which occurred in periods 1, 2, 6, and 7, I will use a conservative estimate of the mean. Using all 7 observed samples for the mean and standard deviation provides a stable baseline for the OR engine's base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is low (11 units). Historical demand over 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 191 units (217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202, 182). I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stable mean of approximately 191. Since L=0 and the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, this will result in a base stock level targeting the mean demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to account for the observed volatility (std dev approx 18). This approach balances the stock-out risk seen in Periods 1, 2, 6, and 7 with the high holding cost ($1.0/unit, which equals the profit/unit).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability with a slight downward trend and some volatility. Historical demand values are [217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202, 182, 158]. The mean demand of all samples is approximately 187, while the more recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 180.6. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally be the median demand. Since current inventory is 33 and lead time is 0, the backend will target covering the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the overall mean while remaining responsive to the recent slight dip, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the parameters are currently stable.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the observed demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 187 units and a standard deviation around 18.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals within the same period (P1 through P10). However, the system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit entering Period 11, despite a history of stockouts or near-stockouts in periods 1, 2, 6, 7, and 10. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, which the OR backend will target. To ensure we capture the demand mean and volatility accurately for this stable regime, I am using the last 10 periods (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 183 units and a standard deviation of about 15 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders arrive within the same period (lead_time = 0). There is a high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $1.0), yielding a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will naturally target using the base-stock policy. Demand has remained relatively stable in a range between 158 and 213 (excluding initial seed data). I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full observed history from Period 1 to Period 11, as there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals yet to justify a shorter window or 'explicit' overrides. L=0 calculation is verified.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 12. Current on-hand inventory is 30 units. Demand has been relatively stable, with values ranging from 158 to 217. The recent 5 periods (P8-P12) show mean demand of 174.4 and a standard deviation of 14.3. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.5), the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full history since no major regime shift is detected, and use the 'default' lead time method since it aligns with observations.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms this (actual lead time has been 0 in all 13 periods). Current inventory is low (on-hand: 9). Demand over the last 13 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 183 units. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy (using z=0) will target the mean demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial sample seeds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since Period 1. Observed demand from the last 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 181 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profitability relative to holding cost (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. To maintain adequate stock while avoiding excessive holding costs (current on-hand is 23), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the most stable recent demand profile. This will calculate mu_hat as (1+0)*mean(last 14) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+0)*std(last 14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods. The historical demand samples (including the initial 5 and the 15 gameplay periods) show a mean of approximately 179 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At this service level, the base stock objective is simply the median (or mean for symmetric distributions) of the demand over (L+1) periods. Currently, L=0, so the backend will aim to cover demand for a single period. Looking at the last 15 periods, the mean demand is 179. demand has fluctuated between 158 and 213. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime and ensure the OR backend has enough data to calculate an appropriate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but has shown a slight downward trend over the last few periods (most recently 125, following a series in the 150-180 range). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 156.8, which is lower than the long-term average. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To prevent overstocking given high holding costs (equal to profit), I am shifting to a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels and volatility. This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock level downwards to match the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable downward trend over the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17), moving from an average of ~180 to ~140-150. Specifically, the last two periods saw significantly lower demand (125 and 124). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the median demand. To react to the recent drop and avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting around Period 16: average demand decreased from ~180 to ~125 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward shift starting around Period 16. Comparing the historical average (~180 units) to the last three periods (125, 124, 145), the new regime average is approximately 131 units. The carry-over insight from Period 18 confirms this shift. The actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Operating with on-hand inventory of 5 units and no in-transit units, I need to set the base stock level to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means we need to cover 1+0=1 period). I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to recent variability. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the OR engine's capped policy and base stock logic will naturally balance this.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand spiked to 172 units, which is significantly higher than the average since the regime shift (approx. 125 units) and even higher than the previous long-term average. This high demand exhausted the on-hand inventory (132 units), resulting in stockouts. While the carry-over insight noted a decrease in demand, the most recent observation suggests either high volatility or a potential reversal. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for recent volatility, I will use recent_N (N=5) to captures the low-demand periods (16-18) and the high-demand spike in Period 19, while providing a moderate buffer. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the backend computes via the capped base-stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again. From P16-P18, demand was low (~131 avg), but in P19 and P20, it spiked to 172 and 182, causing stockouts. The carry-over insight from P18 regarding a sustained decrease is no longer valid. I am increasing the demand forecast to reflect this recent surge. Given the 1-to-1 ratio of profit to holding cost ($1 each), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR base-stock model (q = p / (p+h)) naturally targets. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and the higher average demand (last 5 periods: 125, 124, 145, 172, 182; mean 149.6). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals (P1-P20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 19: demand rebounded from ~130 units/period (P16-P18) to ~177 units/period (P19-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear regime rebound. After a dip in Periods 16-18 (avg ~131), demand has returned to a higher level in Periods 19-21 (172, 182, 162; avg ~172). In the last three periods (P19-21), we have stockouted or reached zero inventory every period because the ordered quantity (based on the previous low regime) was insufficient. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0, results in a 50% service level target), I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=3 to capture this latest high-demand regime (Periods 19, 20, 21). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with shifting regimes. After a rebound to ~177 units in Periods 19-21, Period 22 dropped significantly to 112 units. This suggests the demand has not stabilized at the higher level and remains inconsistent. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To manage this volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302, which captures the recent high demand periods (19-21) and the most recent drop (22), balancing the risk of stockouts against the risk of high holding costs. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will be roughly equivalent to forecasted demand. Given the high variance in the last 4 periods (172, 182, 162, 112), using a short window for sigma_hat (N=4) ensures we don't under-reserve for the volatility seen in the rebound phase.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shown significant volatility recently: after a brief rebound (P19-P21 average ~172), the last two periods have dropped significantly (P22: 112, P23: 130). Because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the mean (z*=0). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent fluctuation and the shift back to lower volume compared to the P19-P21 peak, while maintaining enough sensitivity to the higher demand seen just three periods ago. I am not adding a new carry-over insight yet as the current low-demand trend has only lasted 2 periods, failing the 3+ period consistency threshold.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high degree of volatility following a rebound in Period 19. While demand peaked around ~177 units (P19-P21), the last three periods (P22-P24) have seen a significant drop to an average of ~117 units (112, 130, 108). This suggests the previous rebound was temporary or the regime has shifted again. Given the equal weight of profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, making it crucial not to overstock. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-P18 behavior (averaging ~144 units), which balances the high rebound periods with the current dip. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility observed in this segment.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected at Period 22: avg demand decreased from ~172 (P19-P21) to ~117 units (P22-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the actual demand was 165 units, which is a significant rebound from the average of ~117 units (P22-P24). This pattern of volatility suggests a likely regime shift back towards a higher mean, similar to the behavior seen in Periods 19-21 (mean ~172). Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and profit/holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%. Setting parameters to cover a slightly higher suspected mean (approx 150) will mitigate the risk of stockouts without incurring excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the recent volatility which includes both the low-demand trough and the current rebound (averaging ~125 across P19-P25 is too low given the P25 spike, so I will weight towards the most recent evidence). I'm choosing N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the full cycle of the last two shifts (P19-P25).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at Period 25: demand increased to 165 units, suggesting a shift away from the Period 22-24 low-demand regime (~117 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with recurring regime shifts. After a low period (P22-P24 avg ~117), Period 25 saw a spike to 165, but Period 26 dropped back to 112. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 125.4. However, the last two periods (P25 and P26) have an average of 138.5. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, which theoretically suggests a base stock equal to the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatile regime (stabilized around ~125-135 units) while maintaining responsiveness to the high fluctuation observed between P25 and P26. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and frequent regime shifts. Most recently, demand dropped from 165 (Period 25) to 112 (Period 26) and 79 (Period 27). This suggests the 'rebound' seen at Period 25 was transient and we are currently in a lower demand regime or experiencing a downward trend. In Period 27, demand was only 79 units, following a 112-unit period. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent downturn (avg of P25-P27 \u2248 118.6). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals (all orders through P27 arrived with lead_time=0). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current high volatility in this new lower regime. This strategy aims to reduce ending inventory while remaining responsive if demand stabilizes slightly above the most recent low of 79.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with a significant downward trend observed between Periods 25-27 (165, 112, 79 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and a downward trend over the last several periods (Period 26: 112, Period 27: 79, Period 28: 90), following a spike at Period 25. The current on-hand inventory is 29 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the demand is currently in a lower-regime-but-volatile phase, I am selecting a recent_N window of 3 periods to capture the latest downward shift (avg \u2248 94 units). This helps prevent over-ordering and high holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), while still providing enough base stock to cover immediate demand given the 0-period lead time. Setting L to default (0) as deliveries are immediate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: average demand decreased from ~140 to ~94 units (-33%) based on periods 26-28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained decrease. From Period 26 to Period 29, demands were 112, 79, 90, and 89, averaging approximately 92.5 units per period. This follows a high-volatility period and represents a clear downward shift compared to the previous regime (Period 22-25 average was ~128). The promised lead time of 0 remains consistent as arrivals have reliably occurred in the same period they were ordered. To align with this new lower-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (given profit $1.0 vs holding cost $1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety margin reflecting recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~130 to ~93 units (-28%) based on sustained lower demand across Periods 26-29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand spiked to 149 units, which is significantly higher than the average of approximately 93 units observed during the low-demand regime of Periods 26-29. This suggests either high volatility or a potential rebound in demand similar to those seen in Periods 19 and 25. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock equivalent to the expected demand for the period. To avoid under-ordering if a rebound is occurring, while acknowledging the recent low-demand regime, I will use a restricted window (N=5) for mu_hat. This balances the recent low periods (26-29) with the most recent spike (30), resulting in a more conservative but responsive forecast. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 30 (149 units), suggesting a potential exit from the Period 26-29 low-demand regime (~93 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a confirmed low-demand regime from Periods 26-29 (avg ~93), Period 30 saw a spike to 149 and Period 31 moderated to 108. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 104.5. Given the target service level (q = 0.5 because profit $1.0 = holding cost $1.0), the base stock model targets the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this most recent volatile phase, which reflects the current shift better than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0, the OR backend will order up to the calculated base stock to cover expected demand in Period 32.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand regime shift at Period 30 remains uncertain but average demand over P26-P31 has stabilized around 105 units, up from the P26-P29 average of 93.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of lower consumption (P26-P29 avg ~93) followed by a return to slightly higher, albeit volatile, levels from P30 onwards (P30-P32: 149, 108, 89; avg ~115). Period 32 demand was 89 units, which ended with 16 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 32 conclude' message (ordered P32, arrived P32). Given the significant demand volatility and the recent fluctuation around a mean of ~115 units, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift behavior starting from P29, while using a wider window for sigma_hat (N=7) to better estimate the standard deviation given the mix of low (79-90) and high (149) values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 115 units/period starting at Period 30, following a low-demand regime of ~93 units (P26-P29).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 30. The demand values for the last four periods are 149, 108, 89, and 121, resulting in an average of approximately 117 units per period. This aligns with the previous insight that the regime stabilized around 115 units. The actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in the history. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current regime's mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock will be set exactly at the expected demand (mu_hat) for the (L+1) period (which is 1 period here). Using recent_N=4 ensures we ignore the previous much lower demand regime (P26-P29) and the higher historical levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 30) shows an average demand of approximately 113 units per period (149, 108, 89, 121, 98), compared to the prior lower regime of ~93 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., Period 34 order arrived in Period 34). Currently, there are 19 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable post-spike regime. This window covers the data from Period 30 to Period 34. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent evidence ensures the base-stock level accounts for the current demand level while providing a buffer for the observed volatility, balancing stockout risks against holding costs given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 30-35) shows an average demand of approximately 108 units (149, 108, 89, 121, 98, 83), which is a shift from the previous low-demand regime of ~93 units. However, there is a clear softening in the last two periods (98, 83). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use a window of the last 6 periods (Period 30-35) to capture this current regime while factoring in the recent volume. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of ~108 units. Given the high volatility observed (std dev ~23 for the last 6 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to cover demand spikes while minimizing excessive holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 30) shows an average demand of approximately 108 units (149, 108, 89, 121, 98, 83, 113). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Given the high volatility in the recent period (standard deviation is significant), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time 'L' will remain 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 30 has stabilized at an average of ~108 units/period (P30-P36).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~108 units per period since Period 30 (P30-P37 demand: 149, 108, 89, 121, 98, 83, 113, 101). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. With equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median demand to balance service levels and holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current stable regime (P30-P37). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the volatility of this specific period segment. L remains at the default (0) as no lead-time drift or lost orders are present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent downward fluctuation, with Period 38 recording a low of 69 units, bringing the average for the current regime (starting at Period 30) down slightly. The average demand from Period 30 to 38 is approximately 104 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 39 units. Since the lead time has remained consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N), I will continue to use the 'default' lead time of 0. For mu_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (covering the period from the known regime shift at P30 to the latest data at P38) to capture the current mean of ~104 units. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the recent volatility (ranging from 69 to 149 units in this period). This strategy aims to satisfy demand while managing holding costs, especially given the recent dip in sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime starting Period 30 has softened slightly with recent lower observations (P38: 69 units), bringing the regime average (P30-P38) to ~104 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 104 units (calculated over the regime starting at P30). Specifically, P39 recorded a demand of 111, confirming that the low of 69 in P38 was a temporary dip rather than a sustained downward shift. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To adapt to the current regime (P30-P39), I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the relative stability of the last 10 periods while excluding the significantly higher demand values from earlier in the game. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will aim for using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 30 has been characterized by an average of approximately 104 units per period (P30-P38). However, the last two periods (P39: 111, P40: 54) show extreme volatility. The Period 40 demand of 54 is the lowest observed in this regime, following a fairly strong Period 39. This suggests a potential softening or at least high variance that needs to be managed. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 51 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (tracking from Period 30 to present) to capture the current regime's mean and variance while smoothing out the recent trough in Period 40. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand volatility increased significantly in P39-P40 (111 and 54 units), though the regime average since P30 remains near 100 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility within the regime established around Period 30. Although the average demand since Period 30 is approximately 100 units, recent periods have fluctuated between 51 and 111. Period 41 ended with 0 on-hand inventory after a demand of 110 units, indicating we are sensitive to stockouts when demand peaks. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods (same-period arrival). To balance the high profit ($1.0) against the high holding cost ($1.0), which implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (targeting the median demand), I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (P30-P41) to capture the current regime's average. Given the increased volatility (standard deviation), sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 12 periods to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed spikes without over-stocking during the low-demand dips.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 30 has shown high volatility but remains centered around a mean of approximately 100-105 units. Recent demand observations for Periods 39-42 were 111, 54, 110, and 101. The average demand for the last 13 periods (P30-P42) is roughly 103 units. Given the high volatility (standard deviation remains significant), I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the characteristics of this specific regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 30, though with significant period-to-period volatility. The average demand since Period 30 (Periods 30-43) is approximately 98.7 units per period. The most recent three periods (P41-P43) show a slight softening (avg 91.3), but this is within the expected volatile range. I will use a recent_N window of 14 periods to capture the stability of this post-P30 regime while smoothing out the high variance seen in recent weeks (e.g., 54 in P40 vs 110 in P41). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. The OR backend will use these settings to determine a base stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost, effectively targeting a 50% service level which is appropriate given the 1:1 cost-benefit ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new lower-demand regime starting around Period 40. Demand in the last five periods (P40-P44) has been 54, 110, 101, 63, and 61, averaging 77.8 units/period. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime average (P30-P39) which was approximately 104. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median demand to minimize the sum of lost profit and holding costs. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adopt a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent downward shift while maintaining sufficient volatility coverage using recent_N for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected at Period 40: average demand decreased from ~104 (P30-P39) to ~78 units (P40-P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower regime starting around Period 40. The average demand across the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 75 units (54, 110, 101, 63, 61, 60), confirming the previous insight of a shift down from the ~100 range. Specifically, the last three periods (P43-P45) show a very stable cluster around 60-63 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median of the demand distribution. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since demand has stabilized significantly at the lower level over the last few periods, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower mean while accounting for the volatility spike in P41. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 75-80 units of demand for Period 46, adjusted for the 18 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 40 confirmed at a lower level: Period 43-45 average demand is ~61 units, consistently lower than the previous P30-P39 average of ~104.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 40. From P40-P46, demand values are 54, 110, 101, 63, 61, 60, and 61. While P41 and P42 showed higher demand, the last four consecutive periods (P43-P46) have stabilized strikingly around an average of 61.25 units. This confirms the 'low-demand' regime identified in the carry-over insights. Actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this new regime starting from P40, filtering out the older, much higher demand levels. This should prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 43 has stabilized significantly: average demand is ~61 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) with very low variance compared to previous periods.

chips(Regular): ordered=59, arrived=59 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=73, demand=64, sold=64, ending on-hand inventory=9
Daily Profit: $64.00, Daily Holding Cost: $9.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown high stability over the last five periods (P43-P47), with demand values of 63, 61, 60, 61, and 64 respectively. This confirms a significant shift to a lower-demand regime with an average of approximately 62 units per period and very low volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 47 conclude' message (order placed P47, arrived P47). Given the high level of stability and the low variance in this specific regime (N=5), I am using 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects this new, lower-demand environment without carrying over the noise from previous higher-demand periods.

Daily Profit: $62.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly lower level starting Period 43. Over the last 6 periods (P43-P48), demand has been 63, 61, 60, 61, 64, 75, averaging approximately 64 units per period with relatively low volatility until the slight uptick in P48. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting L to default (0) and using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this specific low-demand regime. This provides a base stock that covers the expected demand while minimizing holding costs in this lower-volume environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime starting Period 43 reaffirmed with an average of ~64 units (P43-P48), showing much lower mean and variance compared to the P30-P42 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new, stable regime starting at Period 43. Over the last 7 periods (P43-P49), demand has averaged 62.6 units (values: 63, 61, 60, 61, 64, 75, 54) with significantly lower variance compared to earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To respond to this stabilized lower demand, I am using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend's base-stock calculation on the current regime's mean and volatility, preventing over-ordering based on the higher historical demand seen before Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 10 units, and there are no units in-transit.
