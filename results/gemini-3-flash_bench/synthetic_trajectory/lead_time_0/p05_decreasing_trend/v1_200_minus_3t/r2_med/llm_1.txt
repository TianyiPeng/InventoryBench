{
  "rationale": "The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple item. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Analysis of the recent demand regime (Periods 40-49) shows a significant decrease in average demand to approximately 74 units per period, compared to earlier periods. The last five periods (P45-P49) have seen demand figures of 55, 72, 40, 56, and 71, creating an average of 58.8. However, the slightly longer window (P40-P49) suggests a mean closer to 74. Given the holding cost ($1.0) versus profit ($4.0) and the high volatility previously seen in this SKU, I will maintain a target inventory level (order + on-hand) of approximately 110 units. This allows for protection against a return to a 100+ unit demand spike while minimizing holding costs for the current low-demand regime. With 34 units currently on hand, an order of 76 units brings the available inventory for Period 50 to 110.",
