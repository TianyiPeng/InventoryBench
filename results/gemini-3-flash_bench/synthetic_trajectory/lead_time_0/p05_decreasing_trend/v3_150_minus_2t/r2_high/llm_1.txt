Based on the 5-period historical demand data provided (130, 147, 128, 116, 161), the average demand is 136.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in the same period to meet Period 1 demand. To maximize total reward, I need to cover Period 1's expected demand plus a safety margin to account for volatility (approx. 1.5 - 2 standard deviations).
