The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of the same period. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates an average of approximately 136 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). As this is the first period and on-hand inventory is 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Since profit equals holding cost (1:1 ratio), the optimal service level is generally around the median/mean to avoid excessive holding costs while capturing sales. Given the recent demand samples, I will target the higher end of the range to ensure I don't lose sales on the first day, forecasting demand around 140-150 units for Period 1.",
