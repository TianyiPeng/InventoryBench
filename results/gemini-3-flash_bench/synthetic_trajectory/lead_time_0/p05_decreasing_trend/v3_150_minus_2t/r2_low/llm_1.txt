Historical demand over the last 5 periods was 130, 147, 128, 116, and 161, which averages to ~136 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover the expected demand for Period 1 while accounting for the target safety stock. Given the average of 136 and a recent peak of 161, I will target 160 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I will order 160 units to satisfy Period 1 demand and potentially leave a small buffer for Period 2.",

Historical demand samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) suggest an average demand of approximately 136, but recent periods (P5 of samples and P1 of game) show higher values (161 and 165). Given the 0-period lead time, I can adjust inventory safely to meet demand within the same period. Since holding costs ($1.0) equal potential profit ($1.0), carrying excess stock is not ideal, but stockouts are worse for total reward when demand is high.
