To satisfy the expected demand for the current period (using the Period 1 historical sample of 204 as a baseline for the start of the simulation) and maintain a buffer, I will order enough to cover the initial high-side demand.

I will forecast demand for Period 2 at approximately 160 units (a conservative middle ground between the high P1 demand and the historical mean) and subtract the 3 units on-hand.

Given the trend (207 -> 126 -> 88 -> 72), demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level. Total demand needed for the current period (P4) is 72. I already have 72 on hand. However, to avoid a stockout if P4 demand is higher than the sample or to prepare for P5 demand (sampled at 108), I should order. Calculation: On-hand(72) - Expected Demand P4(72) = 0.

(b) Demand regime analysis: Filtering out the high initial launch values (P1-P2), demand from P3 to P16 (14 periods) is as follows: 88, 84, 96, 81, 64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38, 82, 46, 62, 75. The mean for this period is 71.1 units with a standard deviation of 15.8. Recent demand (P13-P16) has shown higher volatility (82, 46, 62, 75), averaging 66.25. (c) Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals (P16 order of 62 arrived in P16). (d) On-hand inventory is 10 units, with 0 in-transit. (e) Final order logic: With a lead time of 0, I only need to cover Period 17's demand. Target stock is set slightly above the mean to account for recent volatility (approx 75-80 units). Given 10 units on hand, an order of 75 units targets a total availability of 85 units, which provides a safe buffer while minimizing holding costs if demand returns to the mean of 71.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in Period 50. Since this is the final period of the game, any remaining inventory beyond what is sold this period will incur a holding cost ($1.00/unit) without any future opportunity for profit (since there is no Period 51). The current demand regime (Phase 5) shows a high-variance pattern with a recent mean of approximately 28 units/period (P43-P49). The last three periods have seen demands of 18, 28, and 25. On-hand inventory is currently 20 units. To maximize total reward, I should aim to satisfy expected demand while minimizing leftover stock. Given the mean of ~25-28 units and the costs involved (Profit $19 vs. Holding $1), it is safer to order a small amount to cover potential demand up to the recent average, but not so much as to risk significant holding costs on the final day. Ordering 8 units brings total availability (on-hand + new arrival) to 28 units, matching the recent demand mean and minimizing terminal waste.",
