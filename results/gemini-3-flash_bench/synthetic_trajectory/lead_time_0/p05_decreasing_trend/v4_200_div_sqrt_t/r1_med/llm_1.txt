The average demand over these 5 periods is 134.6, with significant volatility (high of 204, low of 72). As a 'Regular' chip snack, demand is likely to be relatively steady but can be influenced by local events. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now arrives during the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and can fulfill Period 1's demand. Since current inventory is 0 and I have 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand plus a safety stock buffer to account for the high variance observed in history. I will target a stock level of approximately 200 units to avoid stockouts in the event Period 1 demand matches the historical peak of 204.",

Following the game history provided in the 'GAME HISTORY' section as the source of truth for inventory state: I ended P3 with 72 units. If demand in P4 is expected to be around 72-90 units, I already have 72 units on hand.
