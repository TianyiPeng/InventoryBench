Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a critical ratio q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which corresponds to a z-score of 0 (the base stock level will target the mean demand). We have 5 historical demand samples (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) with a mean of 134.6 and a standard deviation of 51.5. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no specific calendar dates or product seasonality context beyond the raw samples, I will use a conservative approach. Demand has shown a downward trend in the last few samples (72, 108), but since this is only Period 1 and the data is limited, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history while allowing the model to adapt as more periods conclude. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0) as we have no evidence of delays yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 135 units based on a lead time of 0. The demand was 207, far exceeding our supply and resulting in 72 units of lost sales. The actual lead time was indeed 0 as promised. Historical demand samples (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) show high volatility and a mean around 135, but the most recent realized demand in Period 1 (207) suggests we are in a higher demand state than the last few samples of the provided history. Since profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To prevent stockouts seen in Period 1, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to weigh the recent high demand more heavily while using the full history for volatility. I'll set L to default (0).

Daily Profit: $126.00, Daily Holding Cost: $3.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, there was a stockout (135 units provided vs 207 demanded), while Period 2 had a slight surplus (starting inventory 129 vs 126 demanded). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is [204, 155, 134, 72, 108]. Analyzing these 5 samples, the mean is 134.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 50.7. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Since the current period is Period 3, and we have the full demand data sequence provided in the prompt [204, 155, 134, 72, 108], I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent trend (134, 72, 108) which suggests a decline compared to the initial two periods. I will set the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods, where L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first three periods was 207, 126, and 88, showing a clear downward trend. Based on the provided historical demand samples (Period 1-5: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108), demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level compared to the initial spike. The promised lead time is 0, and 'Period conclude' messages confirm that orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). We currently have 59 units on-hand. Given the declining demand trend, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~95 units/period) while maintaining enough stock to prevent stockouts if demand fluctuates back up. L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is consistently observed.

Daily Profit: $84.00, Daily Holding Cost: $57.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. The demand history across the first four periods is 207, 126, 88, and 84. (Note: The provided samples 204, 155, 134, 72, 108 slightly vary from the game history; I will rely on the game history for the local demand regime). There appears to be a significant downward shift in demand after Period 1 (207 units). The average demand of Periods 2-4 is approximately 99 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. With an ending inventory of 57 units and no units in transit, we need to order enough to cover Period 5 demand. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~99) and L=0 ensures the base stock formula reflects the current lower demand regime, preventing overstocking given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Period 1 was high (207), while Periods 2-4 stabilized at a much lower mean (avg ~99).

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear downward shift after Period 1. The initial demand was 204 or 207 units (based on data inconsistencies, but distinctly high), whereas Periods 2 through 5 have averaged approximately 98.5 units (126, 88, 84, 96). Period 1 appears to be an outlier or part of a different initial regime. The 'Period 5' carry-over insight already noted this shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the high Period 1 value, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, focusing strictly on the stabilized regime (Periods 2-5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows a stable demand regime following the initial spike in Period 1. Historical demand from Periods 2-6 is 126, 88, 84, 96, and 81, yielding a mean of 95. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true across all six periods (all orders arrived same-period). The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 5 correctly identified the shift; however, demand has remained consistent around the ~95 mark for 5 consecutive periods now. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime (Periods 2-6) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. With lead time L=0, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+0=1 periods). Current on-hand is 18 units, so the system will order enough to meet the base stock requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 2-6 mean is 95 units, significantly lower than Period 1 (207). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation confirms a sustained low-demand regime. Since Period 2, the demand has fluctuated between 64 and 126, with an average of approximately 89.8 over the last 6 periods (P2-P7). The most recent period (P7) showed the lowest demand yet (64). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this lower regime (Periods 2-7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as Period 1 (207) is an outlier compared to subsequent data. This ensures we don't overstock based on the initial spike while maintaining enough inventory for the current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following Period 1. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (P2-P8), the mean demand is approximately 87.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 20.4. Specifically, demand in the last three periods has been 81, 64, and 76. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in all 'conclude' messages (P1-P8 orders arrived same-period). Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 14. I will use the recent 7 periods (N=7) to capture this stable post-spike regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L=0 as it is reliably delivered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 2-8 mean is 88 units (standard deviation ~20), consistently lower than the initial Period 1 spike. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods over 8 consecutive observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 2. The mean demand for Periods 2 through 9 is 84.25 units, which is significantly lower than the initial Period 1 outlier (207). Recent trends (Periods 7-9) show even lower demand averaging 66.3 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which creates a target service level of 50%, the OR backend needs to be conservative to avoid excessive inventory. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike regime (Periods 2-9) while excluding the Period 1 outlier. Lead time is consistently 0, so the default method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Periods 2-9 mean is 84 units (std ~23), significantly lower than Period 1 (207). Current 3-period trend (P7-P9) is lower at 66 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 2. After reflecting on the history, the mean demand from Period 2 to Period 10 is approximately 82.5 units (std ~22), far lower than the Period 1 spike of 207. A shorter-term look at the last 4 periods (P7-P10) shows an even lower average of 64.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by 10 consecutive observations. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable regime from P2-P10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach accounts for the current stable demand level while ignoring the initial outlier spike. Since the critical fractile q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5, the base stock will target the median demand (z=0), providing a balanced approach to service levels and holding costs for this 0-lead-time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 2-10 mean is 82.5 units (std ~22). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a high spike in Period 1. Since Period 2, the demand has averaged approximately 82.5 units. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) shows a further cooling trend with an average of 64.8 units (64, 76, 59, 59, 66). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 11 consecutive observations where orders arrived in the same period they were placed. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), the system should avoid overstocking. Focusing on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) for the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) will better capture the current lower demand trend and volatility while maintaining a sufficient buffer against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the lower regime; recent 5-period average (P7-P11) is 64.8 units compared to the P2-P10 average of 82.5. Lead time is reliably 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has demonstrably stabilized into a lower regime. The initial Period 1 demand (207) was an outlier. Looking at the history, Periods 2-12 show a significantly lower mean. More specifically, the last 6 periods (P7-P12) show a further downward trend with an average demand of approximately 55 units (64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I will use the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this lower volume, and use 'default' for L since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened: Periods 7-12 average demand is ~55 units (std ~12), compared to the previous stabilization at ~83. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked to 82 units, significantly higher than the previous 6-period average of ~55. This resulted in a stockout (sold 61 units, 0 remaining). The historical mean for P2-P13 is approximately 79 units, but demand has been volatile. Given the stockout and the recent jump, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P7-P13) to capture the recent low-demand regime while factoring in the most recent spike (Avg P7-P13 \u2248 58.4). However, to satisfy the critical need to avoid lost sales when profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, meaning base stock equals mean), I must ensure mu_hat is sufficient. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand behavior and its volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand regime check: Recent 7-period mean (P7-P13) is 58.4 units. Period 13 saw a significant demand spike (82) resulting in a stockout from 0 ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a spike in Period 13 (82 units) followed by a drop in Period 14 (46 units). The historical mean after the initial Period 1 outlier has fluctuated, but a more recent demand regime (P7-P14) averages approximately 61 units with a standard deviation around 15. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5), which implies the OR base stock will target the median (\u03bc\u0302). I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture the mean and volatility of this current regime (P7-P14) while ignoring the very high early data points. This helps the OR system set a base stock that covers expected demand while protecting against the recent variability observed in P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), demand has stabilized into a lower regime with a mean of 59.3 units and a standard deviation of 12.8. Recently, however, demand has shown some volatility: a spike in P13 (82) led to a stockout, and P15 (62) again depleted all on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am using a recent_N window of 9 periods (P7-P15) to capture this lower/stable regime (mean ~60, std ~13) better than the full history, which is still skewed by the high initial demand in P1 (207). This will set the base stock level to roughly 70-75 units, providing a buffer against recent volatility without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P7-P15): Mean demand has decreased to approx 59.3 units with a standard deviation of 12.8, down from the P1 peak of 207 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand was 75 units, but we only had 62 units available, resulting in another stockout. Historical demand shows a significant shift from the initial Period 1 peak (207) to a much lower but fluctuating regime. However, recent demand (P13-P16) has shown higher volatility and higher peaks (82, 46, 62, 75) compared to the stable period between P7 and P12. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is 62.7 units. Given the high criticality (service level q = 0.5 as profit=holding cost, but stockouts indicate a need for more buffer), I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture this increased volatility and mean shift. The lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with no units in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 7, following an initial high spike in Period 1. The recent average demand from Period 7 to Period 17 (11 samples) is approximately 61.7 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand remains volatile with a spike in P13 (82) and P16 (75), and a mean of 64.2 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 7 units. I will use the recent_N method with N=11 (from Period 7 onwards) to capture this stabilized regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, which balances the recent volatility with the established lower baseline. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly equal to the mean. The OR backend's order cap will provide additional protection against over-ordering while allowing for enough stock to cover the expected demand in Period 18.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime compared to the initial Period 1 spike. Over the last 12 periods (P7-P18), the mean demand is approximately 61.4 units. Specifically, look at the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the average demand is 61.16 units, showing consistent behavior despite occasional spikes (like P13 and P16). The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, confirmed by 18 consecutive observations. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5; the OR backend's base-stock calculation (z* = 0) will naturally target the mean of the distribution to balance the costs. Given the stability of the current regime, I will use a window of the last 12 periods (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variability while excluding the high-demand volatility of the first few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P7-P18): Mean demand is approx 61.4 units with lead time consistently at 0 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since the initial spike in Period 1. Based on historical trends and the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, the demand regime from Period 7 to the present shows a stabilized pattern. The mean demand from Period 7 to Period 19 is approximately 58.4 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 14.8. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed and are confirmed in the following period's report. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level calculation (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) results in a critical fractile of 0.5. This implies the base stock should ideally target the median demand to balance the risk of stockouts against the cost of holding inventory. I will use the last 13 periods (Period 7 through Period 19) to set the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this stable regime while filtering out the volatile early data. Setting L to 'default' reflects the promised and observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued downward trend, with the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 46.8 units (75, 56, 46, 29, 28). This is a significant drop from the mean of the P7-P15 regime (approx 59.3). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by 20 consecutive observations. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be near the median demand to minimize total costs. I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the recent decline and reduce holding costs on the 31 units already on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: 5-period average decreased from ~60 to 46.8 (-22%), indicating a transition to a lower volume phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 207 (P1) then stabilized around 80-90 (P2-P11), then further softened to ~60 (P7-P18). In the last 3 periods (P19-P21), demand has dropped even further to an average of 29 units. Using a lookback window (N=5) for mu_hat correctly captures the lower regime (periods 17-21) while smoothing out the minor volatility. The lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 21 consecutive observations where the order placed in Period N arrives during the same period. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level base stock. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed second demand regime shift at Period 19: 3-period average dropped to 29 units, a ~50% decrease from the previous ~60 unit average seen in Periods 7-18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower volume regime starting around Period 19. The average demand for the last four periods (P19-P22) is 30.75 units (29, 28, 30, 36), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (approx. 60 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history. To align with this lower demand regime and avoid excess holding costs (since profit $1.0 vs holding cost $1.0 implies a critical ratio q=0.5, suggesting a base stock near the median), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current ~31 unit demand level rather than the historical average, which is skewed by much higher early-game demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~31 units (P19-P22) from previous ~60 units, a ~50% reduction.

While the long-term history contains much higher demand values (P1 peak of 207), the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show a much lower average of approximately 33.8 units (29, 28, 30, 36, 46). Period 23 saw a slight jump to 46 units, which caused a stockout due to starting inventory only being 31. This suggests the recent mean is trending slightly upward from the low of ~29, but it is still far below the previous ~60 unit regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 23 consecutive observations. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this newest regime (P19-P23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower volume environment while accounting for the recent volatility seen in Period 23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. A significant regime shift occurred around Period 19, where demand dropped from an average of ~60 units to ~35 units. However, the last two periods (P23-P24) have shown a slight upward tick (46 and 53 units), leading to stockouts because the policy was set too low for this slight recovery. To account for this recent variance and avoid further lost sales while maintaining efficiency, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P19-P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the new lower regime (approx 37 units avg) while reflecting the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 holds, but P23-P24 show a localized increase (avg 49.5) compared to P19-P22 (avg 30.7), suggesting potential higher variance or a minor recovery in the new regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. After the initial high-demand period, it stabilized around 60 units (P7-P18). Starting at P19, it dropped significantly, but recent samples (P23-P25) show a slight recovery/increase (averaging 43.7 units vs. previous P19-P22 average of 30.7). Period 25 demand was 32 units, following higher demand of 46 and 53 in P23 and P24. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (P19-P25) to capture this latest regime including the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 0, so L=0. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, aiming to balance stockouts against holding costs closely.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P23-P25) shows partial recovery from the P19 low-demand shift, averaging ~44 units compared to ~31 units in P19-P22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a transitional state after a significant drop at Period 19. While the average from P19-P22 was approximately 31 units, the last four periods (P23-P26) have seen an increase, with demand values of 46, 53, 32, and 41 (average ~43). This suggests the demand is stabilizing at a level higher than the immediate P19-P22 post-drop period, but still lower than the pre-P19 average of ~60. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent partial recovery and increased variance while avoiding over-stocking, I will use a recent_N window of 8 periods (covering P19-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime while respecting the recent upward trend from the post-drop lows. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend base-stock calculation will target.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shift after P19: Demand partially recovered and stabilized in a new range (avg ~43 for P23-P26) compared to the immediate post-drop low (avg ~31 for P19-P22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 23-27) has stabilized around an average of 42.6 units (Samples: 46, 53, 32, 41, 41), which is a partial recovery from the extremely low dip observed between Periods 19-22 (~31 units). Stockouts occurred in Periods 23, 24, 26, and 27 due to actual demand exceeding the available inventory, suggesting the system is currently underestimating the mean and volatility of this new regime. Given the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock formula simplified to q = 0.5 (since Profit and Holding Cost are both $1) suggests targeting the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this latest stabilized segment (P23-P27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adjust the order quantity to better reflect the 43-unit average and account for the observed variance, reducing stockout frequency while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P23-P27): Mean demand is approximately 42.6 units, following a brief dip to ~31 units in P19-P22. Persistent stockouts in P26-P27 indicate the need for higher stock levels in this range.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime following the partial recovery at Period 23. From Period 23 to 28, the demand samples are 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, and 34. This results in a 6-period mean of approximately 41.2 units with a standard deviation of 7.5. Although Period 28 saw a slight dip to 34, the preceding periods (P26-P27) resulted in stockouts, suggesting that the inventory targets need to remain firm to cover the mean demand of ~41 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by 28 consecutive conclusions. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current regime (P23-P28), and L to default as the promised lead time of 0 is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P23-P28): Mean demand is approx 41.2 units (std ~7.5), following the partial recovery from the P19-P22 low-demand phase (~31 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant drop in Period 19. Since Period 23, the demand has fluctuated between 32 and 53 units, with a mean of approximately 41.2 units as noted in the previous carry-over insight. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given that current on-hand inventory is 9 units and we are in a relatively stable regime with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a target service level/quantile of 0.50), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=7 covers the period from P23 to P29, which accurately captures the current 'recovered' demand level following the P19 dip. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean and volatility while avoiding the influence of the much higher demand seen in early periods (P1) or the deep dip (P19-P22).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a partial recovery from a significant drop in Period 19. From Period 23 to Period 30, demand has averaged 41.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 6.5. This is distinct from the immediate post-drop low (avg ~31). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the current stable regime since P23) to capture the current demand level while filtering out the volatile history from prior regimes. This should provide sufficient stock to prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P23, P24, P26, P27, and P30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following a partial recovery from a significant drop at Period 19. Looking at the data from Period 23 through Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 41.3 units ( (46+53+32+41+41+34+33+42+32)/9 = 354/9 \u2248 39.3, or refined: P28-P31 avg is (34+33+42+32)/4 = 35.25). However, the carry-over insights suggest a stabilization around 41 units with periodic spikes causing stockouts. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high stockout frequency when ordering too conservatively (P23, P24, P26, P27, P30), I will use a recent_N approach targeting the stabilized regime (N=9, covering P23-P31) to capture the current mean and variance while protecting against the observed spikes. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the recent +40 unit demand peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~35-40 units following the partial recovery noted after Period 23. Recent demand observations (P28-P32) are 34, 33, 42, 32, and 18. The average of these last 5 periods is 31.8, though Period 32 shows a significantly lower value (18). Given the previous 'stabilized' regime was closer to 40, this drop might be transient or a new softening. We will use a slightly longer window (N=8) to capture the stable recovery phase (P25-P32), which averages 34.1 units, providing a more robust estimate than the very recent dip while still being responsive. Lead time remains consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 22. The target base stock will be set using recent_N for both mean and variance to align with this current low-to-moderate volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the post-P19 stabilized regime, though Period 32 (18 units) reflects a potential localized dip or further softening compared to the P23-P31 average of ~41 units.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 23, with the recent Period 33 demand returning to the mean levels observed in this phase (avg ~41) after a localized dip in Period 32. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue to use a recent_N strategy for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the behaviors of this stabilized post-P23 regime (n=11 periods from P23 to P33). Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the parameters reflect the current demand level of ~38-40 units while accounting for the recent variance, including the stockout in Period 33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 19, with a partial recovery observed after Period 23. In the most recent 12 periods (P23-P34), demand has averaged 37.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 9.4. Although Period 32 showed a significantly lower demand of 18 units, the following periods (P33-P34) saw demand return closer to the recent average (40 and 26 units respectively). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire history. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture this post-recovery regime (P23-P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the model to adjust to the 35-40 unit range while accounting for the recent variability that caused stockouts in P26, P27, P30, and P33.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stabilized regime following the partial recovery at Period 23. Over the last 13 periods (P23-P35), demand has averaged approximately 36.4 units with a standard deviation of around 9.8. Although there was a dip in Period 32 (18 units) and Period 34 (26 units), recent cycles show demand is relatively consistent within the 30-40 unit range. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history, including the most recent periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (3 units). To address the service level while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am using L=0 and focusing on the recent 13-period demand distribution (N=13) to capture the current stable state and ensure enough stock is ordered to meet immediate demand at the start of Period 36.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 23, following a brief dip around Period 19. Over the last 14 periods (P23-P36), the average demand is 37.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 9.3 units. Period 36 concluded with a stockout (demand 44, starting inventory 37), indicating that recent inventory levels were slightly too lean for the current variance. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. To ensure the backend OR policy adequately covers demand for the current period Plus the lead time (L=0, so 1 full period of demand coverage) while accounting for recent stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 to capture this stable post-dip regime. This provides a balanced \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 that reflects the most recent sustained behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a slight uptick in volatility and mean recently. While the post-Period 23 regime stabilized around 41 units, Period 37 saw a spike to 62 units, resulting in a stockout. Previous periods also show intermittent spikes (e.g., P33, P36) causing stockouts. Because lead time remains consistently 0, the strategy is to provide enough inventory to cover same-period demand spikes. Given the recent variability (P32 was 18, P37 was 62), I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods (starting from P23) to capture the current regime's mean and variance while overweighting the recent volatility to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these statistics to set a base stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus safety stock).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following Period 23 stabilization (avg ~41) is showing increased volatility, with recent spikes (P36: 44, P37: 62) leading to stockouts. Transitioning from a 10-period to a 15-period lookback to better capture this variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility in the recent regime (P23-P38). After a period of relative stability (avg ~41), we saw spikes (P36: 44, P37: 62) followed by a sharp drop in P38 (11). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high unit holding cost ($1.0) and high profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, which naturally leans towards lower inventory. However, to account for recent volatility and avoid the frequent stockouts seen in P36-P37, I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This lookback period (P24-P38) captures the full range of recent demand fluctuations (from 11 to 62), providing a more robust estimate of current variance while moving past the extremely low dip in P19-P22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility in the post-Period 23 stabilization phase. While the long-term average for this regime (P23-P39) is approximately 36 units, recent levels have fluctuated sharply between 62 (P37) and 11 (P38, P39). This high variance led to stockouts in P36 and P37. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which theoretically means the base stock should align with the median/mean. However, the OR backend's capped policy and the recent high volatility necessitate a stable lookback. I will use a recent_N of 17 (P23-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full variance of the current regime while discounting the much higher demand seen in the first 20 periods. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P39: Continued high volatility (range 11-62) with a mean of ~36 units; standard deviation has increased due to recent spikes and dips.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 17 units. Demand analysis over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) shows a mean of approximately 32.5 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. There is significant volatility, as evidenced by large swings (e.g., 62 units in P37 vs. 11 units in P38). The carry-over insights correctly identified this increased variance. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (base stock = \u03bc) before factoring in volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's volatility while maintaining stability against the recent sharp drops in P38-P40.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 14 over last 15 periods) despite recent low demand (P38-P40 avg ~14). Maintaining 15-period lookback to buffer against volatility seen in P36-P37.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility despite a recent softening in volume. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 24.8, but this follows significant spikes in P36 (44) and P37 (62). Over the last 15 periods (P27-P41), the mean is 32.7 with a standard deviation of approximately 13.8. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock (mu_hat) should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using a 15-period lookback (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a sufficient buffer against the intermittent demand spikes seen in the latter half of the game, while recognizing the overall lower mean compared to earlier regimes. This balances the risk of stockouts (as seen in P36-P37) against holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) (Periods 38-42) shows a shift towards lower volume (averaging 17.2 units) compared to the previous volatile period (P23-P37 avg ~38 units). Although there were significant spikes in P36-P37, the last five periods have consistently recorded demand between 11 and 24 units. I will use a lookback period (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This choice balances the need to respond to the recent low-demand cluster while maintaining a safety buffer based on the high volatility observed in P36-P37, which led to prior stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Recent 5-period average (P38-P42) is 17.2 units, a significant decrease from the P23-P37 average of ~38 units, though high volatility from P36-P37 remains a consideration for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower, yet highly volatile regime starting around Period 38. The most recent demand (Period 43) was 42 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the preceding five periods (17.2 units), confirming that volatility remains a major factor despite a lower mean. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the stockout in Period 43 (ending inventory 0), I need to set parameters that provide adequate safety stock for this volatility. I will use a 10-period lookback (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to balance the recent softening trend (P38-P42) against the periodic spikes observed (P36-P37, P43). This lookback captures the high-variance behavior (range 11-42) better than a very short window, while still being responsive to the overall lower demand level compared to the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high within the low-volume regime: Period 43 spike of 42 units follows a 5-period average of ~17 units, maintaining the pattern of unpredictable spikes causing frequent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to display a high-volatility, low-volume regime. Recent history shows that despite several periods of low demand (P38-P42), spikes like P43 (42 units) and P44 (32 units) lead to stockouts because the inventory position based on short-term averages is insufficient. The current inventory is 0. To protect against these recurring spikes while responding to the lower base demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 (covering P38-P44) to capture the most recent mean of ~22.8 units. However, I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 for sigma_hat to maintain a larger safety buffer based on the higher volatility observed over the last 15 periods (which includes the significant spikes in P36-P37 and P43-P44). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: High demand volatility persists in the low-volume regime; demand spikes (e.g., P43: 42, P44: 32) frequently exceed the short-term mean, requiring a wider lookback for volatility (N=15) to maintain service levels.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a low-volume regime. Recent demand (P43-P45: 42, 32, 37) has consistently exceeded the immediate short-term preceding average (P38-P42: ~17), leading to three consecutive periods of stockouts. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To address this volatility and minimize stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will maintain a recent_N lookback of 15 periods for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This capture period (P31-P45) includes both the quiet Phase (P38-P42) and the recent spikes, providing a more robust base stock level to satisfy the current upward pressure in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 43-45 demand (avg 37) represents a significant increase compared to the Period 38-42 average (17.2), resulting in sustained stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility within a low-volume regime. Recent demand (P43-P45) saw a spike (avg ~37 units), leading to stockouts, while P46 dropped significantly to 11 units. This fluctuation underscores the need to maintain a wider lookback to capture volatility and ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer. I am setting L=0 as consistently observed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P37-P46) to balance the high-volume spike in P37 (62 units) against the more recent low-volume behavior, providing a stable estimate that accounts for the frequent unpredictability in this regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a generally lower-volume regime. Recent demand has fluctuated between 11 and 42 units over the last five periods (P43: 42, P44: 32, P45: 37, P46: 11, P47: 18), yielding a mean of roughly 28 units. While this is higher than the immediate low of 17.2 seen around Period 42, it is still lower than the earlier stabilizing range of ~40 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. To capture the current volatility while acknowledging the moderate recovery from the P42 low, I will use a recent_N lookback of 10 periods for mu_hat (covering the transition from the P38-P42 low into the recent spikes) and a wider recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against the frequent spikes that have caused stockouts (e.g., P43-P45).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand volatility remains significant; recent 5-period average (P43-P47) has recovered to 28 units from the Period 42 low (17 units), but remains unpredictable (range 11-42).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits high demand volatility within a low-volume regime. Recent demand (P43-P48) has fluctuated between 11 and 42 units, with an average of approximately 28 units, recovering from a lower dip around P42 but remaining unpredictable. Stockouts occurred in P43, P44, P45, and P48, indicating that our recent inventory levels were insufficient to handle the spikes even with a lead time of 0. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, but consistent stockouts suggest we are under-forecasting volatility. I will maintain the 15-period lookback (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high-demand spikes of P36-P37 and P43-P45, which helps buffer against the 'unpredictable spikes' noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a generally lower-volume regime that started around Period 38. Recent demand (P45-P49) has fluctuated between 11 and 37 units. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P38-P49) is approximately 23.6 units with a standard deviation of 10.4. Period 49 demand was 25 units, leaving 3 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 43-45 and 48, I will use a 12-period lookback (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the most recent regime shift and the significant variance that has characterized it, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following Period 38 remains volatile but stabilized at a lower volume: P38-P49 mean is ~23.6 units with significant fluctuations (range 11-42).
