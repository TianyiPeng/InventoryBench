Historical demand data shows the first five periods had demands of 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108, averaging approximately 135 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is prudent to cover the highest historical demand observation (204) plus a safety buffer to avoid stockouts, as we start with zero inventory. Our objective is to satisfy current demand and arrive at a healthy ending inventory for Period 2.
