Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean demand is approximately 99.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we have no reason to suspect otherwise yet, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant historical statistics to seed our base stock calculation. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high service level (due to $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) against inventory costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 128 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 14 units after 114 units were sold. The promised lead time is 0, and the first observation confirms an actual lead time of 0. Historical demand samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) show a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 32. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the OR engine adapt to observed performance. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant historical statistics while acknowledging the actual demand in Period 1 (114) aligns closely with the provided sample mean. The objective is to maintain a base stock that covers immediate demand since lead time is effectively 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $459.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 114 and 117 (mean = 115.5). The conclude messages for Periods 1 and 2 confirm the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), which matches the promised lead time. The OR backend needs to cover the current period's demand (Lead time L=0, Review period R=1, so L+1=1). Given the demand is relatively stable, I will use all available samples (N=2) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) targets the 115-120 range. Since on-hand is very low (9), the OR engine will place an order approximately equal to the mean minus 9 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1, 2, and 3) confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand has remained relatively stable, with values of 114, 117, and 103 (Mean: 111.3). The 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) shows higher variance and lower values in recent periods (58, 121 for Periods 4 and 5), but since I am currently at the start of Period 4's decision phase, I can only rely on concluded data up to Period 3. To maintain a high service level (Stockout cost is $4, Holding cost is $1), I will use the recent history (N=3) to estimate mean and volatility. Because the lead time is 0, the base stock effectively covers only the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-4), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable, with values of 114, 117, 103, and 106 (mean ~110). Using the provided samples for chips(Regular) (Period 1: 118, Period 2: 130, Period 3: 72, Period 4: 58, Period 5: 121), there is a slight discrepancy between the system samples and the game history demand, but the history demand is the ground truth for state transitions. On-hand inventory is currently 12 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it correctly captures the observed 0-period delay. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the recent consistent demand profile. This will set the base stock to cover the roughly 110 units of demand expected this period (since L=0, we need to cover 1+0=1 period of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, demand (132) exceeded available supply (116), resulting in a stockout and ending inventory of 0. Analyzing the provided historical demand for Period 1-5 (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean is 99.8. However, the game history observations for Period 1-5 (114, 117, 103, 106, 132) show a higher consistent demand mean of 114.4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. To prevent future stockouts while demand remains relatively high, I will use recent_N for both mean and variance calculation (N=5) to capture the trend seen in the game history rather than the earlier sample data. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level that covers (L+1) demand, which at L=0 means current period planning.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods over 5 consecutive cycles (P1-P5). Demand shows a slight upward trend in the last cycle (132), averaging 114.4 units in game history vs 99.8 in initial samples.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (all 6 historical orders arrived same-period). Demand has fluctuated significantly: after a peak of 132 in Period 5, it dropped to 80 in Period 6. The average demand across the 6 game periods is 108.7 units, compared to the initial sample mean of 99.8. Because demand is volatile (std dev is approximately 17-20), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most relevant demand behavior while accounting for the recent drop and the previous spike. Using N=6 covers all active game data where we've seen real-time demand variations. The base stock policy will aim to cover demand for current period (L=0, so L+1=1 review period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed through Periods 1-7). The demand has shifted significantly: from an average of ~114 units in the first 5 periods to an average of 76 units over the last two periods (P6=80, P7=72). This follows a spike of 132 in P5. The initial samples provided (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) also show high volatility. Given the recent drop, using a smaller window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat captures the downward trend (Avg: 94.6) better than the long-term average, preventing excessive overstocking while account for the P5 spike. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to reflect current volatility. With L=0, the system must cover only the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand decreased from ~114 (P1-P5) to ~76 (P6-P7), a reduction of approx 33%. Actual lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift. While periods 6 and 7 had lower demand (~76 average), Period 8 saw a significant spike back to 110 units. This suggests the previous 'regime shift' insight might have been premature or representing high volatility rather than a sustained drop. Given the current on-hand inventory of 13 units and lead time of 0 (consistently confirmed through Period 8), I need to ensure enough stock to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent volatility (avg ~87), but I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time, and use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=8) to account for the overall game-long volatility and prevent stockouts during spikes like Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 8 spike (110 units) contradicts the previous drop in P6-P7, suggesting a wider variance in the current regime than initially estimated in P8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed demand history shows a transition from a high-demand regime (P1-P5 avg ~114) to a more volatile, lower-demand regime (P6-P9 avg ~85). The last four periods (80, 72, 110, 77) show high variance, making a standard mean calculation potentially risky. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the shift while managing the observed volatility, I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current mean (84.75) and its standard deviation (17.3) more accurately than the full history, ensuring the base-stock levels are responsive to the recent regime shift while maintaining a buffer for spikes like seen in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized into a high-variance, lower-mean phase (P6-P9 avg: 85) compared to the initial phase (P1-P5 avg: 114). Actual lead time remains fixed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed through 10 finished cycles. Analyzing the demand history, we observe two distinct regimes: Phase 1 (P1-P5) with a mean of 114.4 units, and Phase 2 (P6-P10) with a lower mean of 85.6 units (80, 72, 110, 77, 89). The demand in P10 was 89, which is close to the Phase 2 average. Since the transition occurred around Period 6 (5 periods ago), I will use N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (mean ~85.6, std ~14.7) while maintaining the Lead Time (L) at the promised value of 0, as it is consistently observed. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during occasional spikes (like P8's 110) while minimizing holding costs for the currently lower demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are observing a stabilized demand regime that began around Period 6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (11 consecutive observations of L=0). The demand in this second regime (P6\u2013P11) has a mean of 87.3 (80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96), which is significantly lower than the initial phase (P1\u2013P5 mean: 114.4), but shows higher relative variance. The most recent demand (P11) was 96. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this lower-mean, high-variance regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current demand levels (mu_hat) and the observed volatility (sigma_hat) for a 0-lead time environment (covering current period demand). Setting L to 0 via explicit ensures the calculation reflects the actual observed performance rather than just the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P6-P11 confirmed: Mean 87.3 units vs 114.4 units in P1-P5 (-24%). Lead time stable at 0 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory is nearly depleted (on-hand: 1). Historical data from P6 to P12 confirms a sustained demand regime shift; the mean demand has dropped from ~114 (P1-P5) to approximately 89 (P6-P12). Specifically, looking at the last 7 periods (P6-P12), demand values were 80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96, and 99, averaging 89.0 units. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized lower-demand regime while accounting for the recent slight upward trend (P11-P12 averaging 97.5), I will base mu_hat on the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) and sigma_hat on the same window to capture the current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period) without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P6-P12 is stable with a mean of 89.0 units, significantly lower than the initial P1-P5 mean of 114.4 (-22%). Lead time remains 0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second regime starting from Period 6. Calculating the mean across the last 8 periods (Period 6 to Period 13), the average demand is 89.1 units, compared to the initial 114.4 units in Periods 1-5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Using recent_N=8 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters will allow the OR engine to capture this shift in mean and the associated volatility of this lower-demand regime. Since the lead time is reliably 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect historical performance while ensuring the OR engine targets enough inventory for the current cycle's demand (L+1 = 1 period).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second regime starting from Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 14 (9 samples), the mean demand is 88.2 units (80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96, 99, 85, 86), which is significantly lower than the initial P1-P5 mean of 114.4. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Given that we are in Period 15 and the current regime has persisted for 9 periods, I will use N=9 for demand parameters. The service level target remains high due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a stockout with demand spiking to 134 units, while we only had 99 units on-hand. This spike is significantly higher than the average of the current regime (P6-P14 avg: 87.5). The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To adjust for this increased volatility and the recent stockout, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=10 to capture the recent regime including the spike (P6-P15 mean is approx 92.8). For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using N=10 to incorporate the increased variance from the recent 134-unit demand period. The service level target (q) remains 0.8 ($4/($4+$1)), and since L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock of mu_hat + z*sigma_hat to cover the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 15 (134 units), breaking the relative stability of the P6-P14 regime (mean 87.5). This indicates shifted volatility or a potential new regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand dropped significantly to 40 units following a sharp spike of 134 in Period 15. This confirms the 'high-variance' observation noted in previous insights (P9, P16). The mean demand since the major regime shift in Period 6 (P6-P16) is approximately 88.9 units. However, recent volatility (last two periods: 134, 40) makes the mean estimate less stable. Given the critical shortage in Period 15 and the current high ending inventory of 69 in Period 16, I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the post-shift period P6-P16) to capture this lower-demand regime while respecting the increased variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 0, so L=0. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while adjusting for the high standard deviation observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in P15-P16 (134 units followed by 40 units), maintaining the P6-P16 regime mean at 88.9 units but significantly increasing variance compared to the P1-P5 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. After a stable regime from Period 6-14 (mean ~87), demand became extremely volatile starting in Period 15 (samples: 134, 40, 33). The last two periods show a sharp decline, with Period 17 being the lowest demand recorded (33 units). At Period 18, we start with 75 units on-hand, which is significantly more than recent demand levels. Given the 0-period lead time, we have the flexibility to adjust quickly. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this recent downturn and high volatility, preventing over-ordering while facing this sudden drop in demand. The base stock will naturally lower to account for the high on-hand inventory (75 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/instability detected starting P15: Recent samples (134, 40, 33) show a sharp decline and increased volatility compared to the P6-P14 average of 87.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift and cooling from the previous regime. After a peak of 134 in Period 15, demand dropped to 40, 33, and most recently 67 in Period 18. The average of the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is approximately 68.5, which is notably lower than the earlier P6-P14 regime mean (87.5). Given the current on-hand inventory of 50 units and the consistently observed lead time of 0 (L=0), the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mean + safety_stock) should react to this decrease to avoid excess holding costs, while remaining prepared for high variance. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat captures this recent dip, while a slightly longer window for sigma_hat (recent_N=6) captures the underlying volatility seen since the P15 spike. L remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 16: Mean demand has decreased to approximately 46.7 units (P16-P18) from the previous P6-P14 average of 87.5, following a final spike in P15.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted downwards starting from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 19 is approximately 46.5 units ((40+33+67+46)/4), compared to the previous regime (P6-P14) average of 87.5. Although P15 was a spike (134), the subsequent four periods confirm a sustained drop. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently 54, which is slightly above the recent average, so the OR backend should order a small amount or nothing to align with the new base stock level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: Mean demand decreased to ~46.5 units (P16-P19) from the P6-P14 average of 87.5 (-47%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 16. The most recent demand (P16-P20) values are 40, 33, 67, 46, and 62, giving a mean of 49.6. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (P6-P14 avg ~87). Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory because the order placed was too small (5 units) to cover the demand (62 units). Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous cycles. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current low-demand, high-variance regime while ensuring the OR engine targets the necessary service level (profit/cost ratio is favorable). L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (starting P16) confirmed with mean ~50 units, significantly lower than the P6-P14 regime (~87 units). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 21. After a period of lower demand (P16-P19 avg ~46), the last two periods (P20-P21) have seen demand rise to 62 and 85 respectively. This suggests the previous 'low demand' regime (P16-P20) might be ending or was more volatile than expected. I'm focusing on the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture this transition, which averages 55.5 units, but specifically acknowledging the upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in the last two periods. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot away from the previous very low estimates while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Following a low-demand phase (P16-P19 avg 46.5), demand has increased in P20 (62) and P21 (85), suggesting a potential return to the P6-P14 regime levels or increased volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a brief spike to 85 in Period 21, demand dropped back to 40 in Period 22. Looking at the history since the last major regime shift (Period 16 onwards), demand values have been [40, 33, 67, 46, 62, 85, 40]. The mean of this recent period is approximately 53.3, which is significantly lower than the P6-P14 mean of ~87. However, the high variance (ranging from 33 to 85) necessitates a slightly conservative buffer. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current behavior while acknowledging the recent instability, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the period from P16 to P22. This keeps the forecast responsive to the lower demand level while accounting for the high volatility observed in this segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 confirmed as high-variance with a mean of 53.3 units (range 33-85), which is a 39% reduction from the P6-P14 mean of 87.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and regime instability. After a low-demand phase (P16-P19), we observed a temporary spike in P21 (85), followed by a return to lower levels in P22 (40) and P23 (46). The current regime, characterized as high-variance with a lower mean since Period 16, persists. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 52.4 units, which is much lower than historical phases. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current high variance and potential for stockouts (as seen in P20 and P21), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current lower-mean, high-volatility regime specifically. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed throughout. This balance should provide sufficient safety stock for spikes while acknowledging the overall lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P23) confirmed as lower mean (~52.4 units) with high relative volatility (range 33-85). Previous regimes were P1-P5 (~114) and P6-P14 (~87.5).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began at Period 16. Recent demand values (P16-P24: 40, 33, 67, 46, 62, 85, 40, 46, 79) yield a mean of approximately 55.3. Period 24 saw a stockout with demand reaching 79, exceeding our previous assessment of the regime mean (~52). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire history. Given the frequent stockouts (P20, P21, P24) and high demand variance, I am increasing N to 9 to capture the entirety of the current regime's behavior since P16, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent volatility while accounting for the lower mean compared to earlier game phases. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that better handles the spikes observed in the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 (9 periods observed) has an average of 55.3 units with high volatility (range 33-85). Stockouts in P20, P21, and P24 indicate current inventory parameters are slightly under-recovering for the variance.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 16 is characterized by low volume and high variance (mean ~55 units, range 33-85). However, Period 25 recorded 0 demand, which is a significant outlier compared to all 30 previous data points (initial + history). While this could signal a new regime or a temporary halt (e.g., an inventory audit or holiday closure), shifting my forecast immediately to 0 would risk a stockout if demand returns to its typical ~55 unit average. I will use recent_N (N=10) to incorporate the 0 demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent higher-variance regime (P16-P24). Lead time remains consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 71, which currently exceeds the average demand of the previous regime, suggesting a cautious replenishment approach is needed to avoid unnecessary holding costs if the 0-demand trend continues.

Carry-over insight: Period 25 recorded 0 demand, a extreme deviation from the P16-P24 regime (mean ~55) and the lowest demand observed in game history. This may indicate a temporary pause or a new regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand returned to a high level (114 units), signaling that the Period 25 'zero demand' was an outlier and the regime starting at Period 16 remains highly volatile. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 0. Historical analysis shows three regimes: P1-P5 (avg 114), P6-P14 (avg 87.5), and P16-P26 (avg 54.8 excluding outlier P25, or 49.8 including it). Since P26 demand (114) matched the initial high-demand regime, I am prioritizing responsiveness to prevent further stockouts (observed in P20, P21, P24, P26). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=11 to cover the entirety of this volatile third regime (P16-P26), and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the extreme deviation seen in recent periods (0 to 114), ensuring the 'cap' doesn't prematurely restrict the order during this resurgence. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 26 demand (114) confirms that the P16-P25 regime is characterized by extreme volatility (0 to 114 range) rather than a sustained low-demand shift. This suggests a return to higher consumption levels or significant periodic spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting from Period 24. We've observed demand sequences of 79, 0, 114, and 100 in the last four periods. Period 27 concluded with a stockout (100 demand vs 94 available), indicating that our safety stock is currently insufficient to cover these high-end spikes. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the recent regime shift from a lower mean (approx 50-60) to high-variance behavior with recent samples averaging 73.25 (P24-P27) but swinging between 0 and 114, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full scope of this heightened volatility while including the recent spikes. This will raise the base stock level to better protect against stockouts during these 100+ demand events, balancing the high profit ($4) against the relatively lower holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 24, with demand ranging from 0 to 114. Average demand in the most recent 4 periods is 73.25, up from the P16-P23 average of ~53.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant return to high-volume, high-volatility levels. Since Period 25 (0, 114, 100, 117), demand has averaged 82.75 units over the last 4 periods, which is a sharp increase from the previous low-mean regime (P16-P23 avg ~53). The last three periods have consistently seen demand \u2265 100, and stockouts have occurred for four consecutive periods (P24, P26, P27, P28) with zero ending inventory, indicating the model is under-predicting the current demand surge. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. To capture this recent pivot and recover from stockouts, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and volatility to prioritize the current high-demand data (including the P25 outlier of 0 which offsets the extreme mean slightly but captures the high variance needed to justify enough safety stock).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 26: Mean demand has returned to high levels (avg 110.3 units for P26-P28) with extreme volatility, effectively ending the lower-mean regime observed between P16-P24.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 26, moving from a lower-mean period (P16-P24 mean ~55) back to a high-demand, high-volatility phase. Recent demand for P26-P29 has been 114, 100, 117, and 61 (average 98). The last value (61) reflects a drop but remains within the volatile range of this current regime. Stockouts in Period 26, 27, and 28 indicate that current inventory levels were insufficient to meet the rebound in demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the average of this new high-demand regime (P26-P29) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance observed lately (ranging from 0 to 117 since Period 25). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P26-P29) mean is ~98 units, returning to levels similar to the initial game state, but with increased volatility (P25-P29 range 0-117).

Daily Reward (R_t): $525.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand, high-volatility phase starting around P26. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) is 105 units (114, 100, 117, 61, 133), which is significantly higher than the preceding P16-P24 regime (~52 units). This return to higher demand levels is accompanied by stockouts in P26, P27, and P28, indicating that inventory levels were insufficient to meet demand despite lead time remaining stable at 0. Because of the extreme volatility recently observed (ranging from 0 to 133), I will focus on the last 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current high-demand regime while capturing the significantly increased variance. Lead time methodology remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P26-P30) confirmed: Mean demand increased to 105.0 units with high volatility (range 61-133), following a low-demand phase in P16-P24.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-mean, high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. Since P26, the demand values are 114, 100, 117, 61, 133, and 84 (mean approx 101.5). This confirms the carry-over insight that we have exited the low-demand phase (P16-P24) and returned to levels similar to the start of the game (approx 100-110 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent return to high demand while accounting for the significant variance (range 61-133 in the last 6 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus exclusively on this current regime. Using a local average helps prevent under-ordering caused by the previous low-demand period, while the volatility estimate ensures we maintain enough buffer to avoid the stockouts seen in P26-P28.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) is characterized by a significantly higher mean (approx. 95.9 units over P26-P32) compared to the previous low-demand phase, but it remains highly volatile (range 61-133). While the most recent two periods (P31-P32) showed slightly lower demand (84 and 62), the overall trend since Period 26 justifies a higher base stock to prevent stockouts seen earlier in this regime (P27, P28). I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P26-P32). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 will ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased standard deviation observed in this current phase, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate service level.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P26-P32) mean is 95.9 units with high volatility (range 61-133), representing a return to near Period 1-5 levels (~114) after the P16-P24 slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime, which began at Period 26, is characterized by both high mean and significant volatility (P26-P33 mean ~91.1, range 58-133). While demand in Period 33 was moderate (58), it followed several periods of much higher demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture the return to high demand levels while protecting against the observed volatility (which has caused stockouts in recent periods like P27 and P28 despite orders being placed), I will use the recent_N method based on the 8 periods of this current regime (P26-P33). This provides a \u03bc\u0302 that reflects the recent ~91 unit average and a \u03c3\u0302 that accounts for the high variance observed in this phase. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the service level requirement is high (80%), so maintaining sufficient buffer for the upside spikes seen in P28 (117) and P30 (133) is essential.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history starting from Period 26 shows a return to a high-demand, high-variance regime. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 91.3 units, with a wide range (58 to 133). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Recent demand observations (93, 58, 62, 84, 133) justify using a recent window (N=9) to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the previous low-demand slump (P16-P25). Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend logic will target a service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84), which is appropriate for managing the observed volatility without excessive holding costs. Setting N=9 for all parameters to align with the detected regime shift at Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P26-P34) mean stabilized at ~91.3 units (range 58-133), confirming the end of the P16-P25 low-demand period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 26, following a lower-demand phase between Periods 16-24. The mean demand for the most recent 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 87.4 units, with significant volatility ranging from 0 to 133. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by game history. Given that profit ($4.0) is much higher than holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 80%. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current regime while excluding the older, lower-demand data points. Current on-hand inventory is 63, and being a 0-lead time environment combined with high demand volatility, the parameters need to ensure enough buffer to prevent stockouts like those seen in P26-P28.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P26-P35) mean demand is 87.4 units with high volatility (range 0-133), maintaining a return to near pre-slump levels. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by a return to high-volume demand (mean ~90) with substantial volatility. Period 36 demand was 94 units, following a period of 52. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Inventory is currently low (18 units on-hand), and given the volatility (range 0-133 in this regime), I will use the last 11 samples (P26-P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime better than the long-term history which includes the P16-P25 slump. Setting L to 'default' (0) as verified by all previous orders.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P26-P36) has an average demand of 88.0 units with high volatility (range 0-133). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, moving from a low-mean phase back to a high-demand, high-variance phase. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 88.0 units (P26-P37), which is a significant departure from the P16-P24 average of ~52.4. However, volatility remains very high, with recent demands ranging from 52 to 117 units. To capture this stabilized but volatile high-demand state, I will use recent_N with N=12 (representing the full span of the current regime from P26 to P37). This provides the OR backend with a mean and variance that reflect the current market conditions. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded period in the history, allowing for same-day replenishment. This setting balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by targeting a service level of 80% (4 / (4+1)).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains active, characterized by high volatility (range 0-133) and a mean demand of approximately 89.5 units. In Period 38, demand was 105, resulting in a low ending inventory of 4 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock needs to cover only the current period's demand (L=0, review+lead = 1 period). Due to the high volatility witnessed in this regime (\u03c3 is significantly higher than in earlier phases), I am using the most recent 13 periods (P26-P38) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N=13 capture ensures we account for the current high-mean, high-variance behavior while excluding the previous low-demand slump (P16-P25). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed throughout the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-volatility, high-mean phase that began around Period 26. Period 39 saw a demand of 112, exceeding the on-hand inventory and resulting in a small stockout (110 units sold). The average demand for this latest regime (P26-P39) is approximately 96.6 units, but the high variance (ranging from 52 to 133 in the last 10 periods) requires a robust sigma_hat to maintain service levels. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=14 to capture this entire current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 0 via 'explicit' ensures the backend uses the proven 0-period lead time rather than relying on the promised value if they differ.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P39) has a mean of 96.6 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~24.5), reflecting a return to P1-P5 levels but with significantly higher risk of stockouts during spikes. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods through P39.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand, high-volatility phase that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 91.1 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent performance (P38-P40) shows sustained high demand (105, 112, 104), confirming the need for a robust base stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's characteristics while acknowledging the high variance (which has led to stockouts in P39), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to cover the period since the last major stabilization (P26-P40). This allows the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for a roughly 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains active, characterized by a return to high-demand levels (P26-P41 mean: 92.5) with significant volatility and frequent stockouts (P39, P41). Period 41 demand was 129 units, reflecting this high-end volatility. With zero on-hand inventory and the actual lead time confirmed stable at 0 periods, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering Period 26 to Period 41) to capture this specific 'high-demand, high-volatility' regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean and variance, providing a higher safety buffer to mitigate the recurring stockouts seen lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed through Period 41: Mean 92.5 units with high volatility (range 0-133), leading to intermittent stockouts when inventory is not set high enough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-demand regime that stabilized around Period 26. In Period 42, we observed 129 units of demand, matching the high demand from Period 41 and resulting in another stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The regime since Period 26 has an average demand of approximately 94.6 units but with significant volatility (highs of 133). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. To prevent consecutive stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=17 (covering Period 26 to present) to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=17 to account for the increased variance seen in this specific regime, which is higher than the early game variance. This should allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level sufficient to cover the frequent demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting around Period 26 continues to show high volume and significant volatility. The mean demand for the last 18 periods (P26-P43) is approximately 91.9 units. However, looking at very recent activity (P39-P43), the average has increased to 115.6 units (112, 104, 129, 129, 104), leading to stockouts in P39, P41, and P42. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am shifting mu_hat to be based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend. For sigma_hat, I will use a window of 18 periods (N=18) to reflect the full volatility of this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend provides an adequate buffer against the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand in the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) has increased to an average of 115.6 units, compared to the P26-P38 average of 82.8. This indicates a sustained high-demand sub-phase within the broader Period 26 regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a sustained high-demand regime. Specifically, the most recent 6 periods (P39-P44) show an average demand of 110.3 units, compared to the broader P26-P44 regime average of 92.5. This upward shift is significant. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory replenishment. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts during the current high-demand volatility. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand sub-phase accurately while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand sub-regime confirmed (P39-P44): average demand is ~110 units, returning to levels seen at the start of the game (P1-P5). High volatility remains a key feature.

Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand phase starting around Period 39. Over the last 7 periods (P39-P45), demand has averaged approximately 112.9 units (112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, 128), which is significantly higher than the previous period averages and matches the highest levels seen at the game's start. Stockouts occurred in P39, P41, P42, and P45, indicating that the inventory levels are insufficient for both the current mean and the high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this current high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the intensified volatility, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to mitigate the stockout risk observed in 4 of the last 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P39-P45: Mean demand ~113 units with extreme volatility, leading to stockouts in 57% of recent periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a high-mean, high-variance phase since Period 39. In the last 8 periods (P39-P46), demand has averaged 113.6 units (range 84-129), very close to the initial P1-P5 levels but with significantly higher volatility. Stockouts occurred in 4 out of the last 8 periods (P39, P41, P42, P45) because the order quantities weren't sufficiently covering the spikes. As we are near the game end (Period 47 of 50) and lead time is consistently 0, the priority is to avoid the high opportunity cost of lost sales ($4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this high-demand regime specifically. The base stock calculation in the backend (at 80% service level) will adjust for the current on-hand inventory of 9.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P39-P46) mean stabilized at 113.6 units, returning to Period 1-5 levels but with persistent high volatility and frequent stockouts (50% rate in this window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime beginning at Period 39. Over the last 9 periods (P39-P47), the average demand is 112.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.3. This regime closely mirrors the initial P1-P5 levels (~114) but with sustained frequency. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing the recent 50% stockout rate observed in this window, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture this specific high-demand phase. The OR backend will compute the base stock using these parameters and the 80% service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Current on-hand is 27, and the decision is for Period 48.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P39-P47) confirmed: mean 112.2 units (similar to P1-P5) with a standard deviation of ~14.3. Lead time remains fixed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility phase starting around Period 39. In the last 10 periods (P39-P48), mean demand is approximately 109.1 units. While the carry-over insight from P48 suggests a mean of 112.2 for P39-P47, the inclusion of P48 demand (81) slightly lowers the average. However, the volatility remains high, with frequent stockouts observed throughout this window (P39, P41, P42, P45). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this high-demand regime's mean and standard deviation, which aligns with the return to initial game levels (Period 1-5 mean was ~114) but accounts for the increased variance seen in the latter half of the game. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to protect against the frequent spikes while keeping holding costs manageable for the single-period lead time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P39-P49) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 107.5 units and a standard deviation of roughly 16.5. This represents a return to the high-demand state seen at the beginning of the game, but with higher volatility leading to frequent stockouts (e.g., P39, P41, P42, P45). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target quantile ~0.80), I will use the recent_N method with N=11 (P39-P49) for both mean and volatility to capture this specific high-demand sub-regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained throughput while accounting for the high variance that has caused recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P39-P49) confirmed: mean 107.5 units, standard deviation ~16.5. Service level adjustments needed to counteract frequent stockouts occurring in 36% of this period window.
