Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical 'conclude' messages to infer the actual lead time, so we must rely on the promised lead time of 0. Initial demand samples (Period 1-5 provided in history) show a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of 32.5. Since we are at the start of the simulation, I will use all available historical data (N=5) to set the baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures that the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the immediate demand of the current period, given that lead time is 0 (order arrives before demand resolution in same period).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 periods (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). The demand in Period 1 was 89 units. Looking at the provided historical demand samples (P1: 118, P2: 130, P3: 72, P4: 58, P5: 121), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period at each decision point. Currently, we have 65 units on hand. I will use the 'default' method for lead time since 0 is confirmed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to encompass the known 5 historical samples provided to establish a stable baseline, as there is not yet enough internal game history to detect a regime shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 89 and 41, respectively. Although the provided system historical samples list demand as 118 and 130 for Periods 1 and 2, the actual game history logs show lower realized demand (89, 41). The promised lead time is 0, and the previous two orders (P1, P2) arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming that the actual lead time currently matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy at 104 units on-hand. Since it is only Period 3, we have very few data points; however, the downward trend in realized demand from P1 to P2 suggests using a shorter window for averaging to avoid over-ordering while still maintaining a safe buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent behavior, and 'default' for lead time as '0' is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1670.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows moderate volatility with samples of 89, 41, and 91 (averaging 73.67). The user-provided external demand data (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) suggests a slightly higher average (~100), but I will prioritize the observed game environment values for the baseline. Given the limited history (3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most relevant demand statistics. Since lead time is 0, the OR engine will target the base stock to cover demand for the current and next period (L+1). Current on-hand is 59 units. No shipments are currently in transit. I will use the default calculation for L as it matches the observations perfectly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1779.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historically, samples provided are 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. In-game observed demand for Periods 1-4 was 89, 41, 91, and 95. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-4 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). Mean demand over the first 4 periods is 79, while the historical samples provided in the prompt average 99.8. Given the volatility (standard deviation of ~25 in-game), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the actual in-game demand distribution which is slightly lower than the initial historical samples. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand (L=0) while considering the observed variance to maintain the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1819.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward trend over the last three periods (91, 95, 97 units) compared to the earlier periods (89, 41). The current mean demand across all 5 periods is 82.6, but the 'recent_3' mean is 94.3. Given the steady rise, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the broader pattern while acknowledging the recent stability around 95 units. Since on-hand inventory is low (24 units), setting the parameters to reflect the recent demand levels will ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to avoid stockouts. The service level target (q) is high (19/(19+1) = 0.95), justifying a robust base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1798.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P6 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand samples provided (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) were initially volatile, but realized demand over the last three periods (P4, P5, P6) has stabilized remarkably at 95, 97, and 96 respectively (mean ~96). I will use recent_N=3 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization and reduce over-ordering or under-ordering based on the earlier, more volatile samples. With a lead time of 0 (L=0), mu_hat (1+L) should target the demand of the upcoming period. The service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 is high, justifying a base stock that covers the mean plus significant safety stock, though the stable recent history suggests lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~96 units/period between Period 4 and Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand increased to 112, exceeding the available inventory of 98, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 concluded periods. Since Period 4, demand has shown a stabilized or slightly increasing trend (95, 97, 96, 112). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime (average ~100) while moving away from the lower initial samples. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent trend will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock to prevent future stockouts while accounting for the current zero inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand increased from ~75 in early periods to ~100 units/period (P4-P7 average 100). Stockout occurred in P7 due to inventory exhaustion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1686.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed a demand of 90 units, following a peak of 112 in Period 7. The current average demand from the stabilized regime (Period 4 through Period 8) is approximately 98 units per period (95, 97, 96, 112, 90). The previous stockout in Period 7 was caused by underestimating this shift. Given the promised lead time of 0 consistently holds true in the history (confirmed arrival in every period), I will maintain L at the default (0). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the mean of this current 98-unit regime while allowing the OR engine to calculate the appropriate base stock for a 95% service level (~$19 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a very high critical ratio, targeting roughly 1.96 standard deviations).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~98 units/period (P4-P8 average: 98). Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual demand was 141 units, which is a significant spike compared to the previously stabilized average (~98). This spike caused a stockout (only 112 units were available and sold). Over the last 6 periods (P4-P9), the mean demand is ~105 units. However, the last period's spike to 141 suggests increased volatility or a potential upward shift. The confirmed lead time remains 0. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent data to account for this higher mean demand and increase the safety stock (via sigma_hat) to protect against the high volatility observed in P9. The goal is to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 9: Demand spiked to 141 from a previous 5-period average of 98, resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1863.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 100 units, returning closer to the recently established regime mean after the Period 9 spike of 141. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Over the last 7 periods (P4-P10), the mean demand is approximately 104 units (95, 97, 96, 112, 90, 141, 100). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the target service level is approximately 95% (q = 19/20). To capture the recent shift to a higher mean while accounting for the significant volatility seen in P9, I am using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~104 units plus a safety stock buffer based on the recent variance, ensuring we recover from the stockouts seen in Periods 7 and 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime mean for P4-P10 is 104 units/period. Period 9 spike (141) indicates high volatility must be managed despite the returning mean of 100 in Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1646.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 demand was 89, which aligns with the return to the mean observed in Period 10 (demand=100) after the Period 9 spike (141). The mean demand for the current regime (P4-P11) is 102.5 units/period. The lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the stable mean but high recent volatility (Period 9 spike), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the P4-P11 regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to ensure the backend accounts for the increased volatility seen in the last several periods. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (95%), so capturing the recent sigma is critical to avoid stockouts like those in P7 and P9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P4-P11 mean is 102.5 units/period. Lead time confirmed at 0 periods consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2622.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, a significant demand spike of 153 occurred, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). This follows a previous spike in Period 9 (141). The mean demand since the regime shift (P4-P12) is approximately 108. However, the volatility is increasing, necessitating a more aggressive safety stock and demand mean estimate to prevent recurring stockouts. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0. I will use the last 9 periods (P4-P12) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat), as this encompasses the current higher-demand regime and its associated volatility. This aims to maintain a higher service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 12 demand spiked to 153, following a Period 9 spike of 141. The mean demand for the current regime (P4-P12) has risen to approximately 108 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2453.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9-P13) shows high volatility with significant spikes (141, 153, 130), compared to the earlier baseline of ~95-100. P13 demand was 130, and the previous carry-over insight correctly identified a mean increase. Given the 17 units on hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and a confirmed lead time (L) of 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for another high-demand period. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P9-P13) is approximately 122.6. To account for this recent shift while maintaining sensitivity to the volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR engine uses the current, higher-demand data to calculate the base stock and safety stock required to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 9 and 12. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-13 mean demand increased to ~123 units/period (compared to previous ~100), with sustained high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1772.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that demand in Period 14 (97 units) returned to the mean after several high-volatility spikes (130, 153, 100, 141). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 71 units with no units in-transit. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), which encompasses the recent regime shift and high-volatility period, mean demand is approximately 118 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%, the OR engine needs to account for the sustained increase in both mean and volatility. By setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will capture the recent average demand of 118 and the high standard deviation from the spikes in P9 and P12, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts while reflecting the most recent demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods, with spikes in P9 (141) and P12 (153), but the most recent two periods (P14: 97, P15: 84) have seen a return to lower demand levels. The mean demand for the current regime (starting from the shift in P9 through P15) is approximately 113. However, the last 5 periods (P11-P15) average 110.6, while the last 3 periods (P13-P15) average 103.6. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (q = 0.95). Inferred lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the recent cooling but maintain protection against the observed volatility (sigma calculated from the last 7 periods is approx 27), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the regime since the P9 spike, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the current high-volatility environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $701.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand significantly dropped to 43 units, which is a major deviation from the previous regime mean of ~123 units observed between Periods 9-13 and the moderate demand in Periods 14-15 (97 and 84 units). This decline suggests a potential downward shift in demand or a return to earlier patterns. Given that the current on-hand inventory is 116 units and demand has dropped sharply in the last period, the inventory level is currently sufficient to cover expected demand without a large new order. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=8 (covering Periods 9-16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and the recent drop, while L remains at the default (0). This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock level to account for both the recent high peaks and the current lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high, but a significant downward trend is emerging: demand dropped from a regime mean of ~123 (P9-P13) to 84 (P15) and 43 (P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significant downward trend over the last three periods (P15: 84, P16: 43, P17: 39), dropping well below the previous regime mean of ~123. The mean of the last three periods is approximately 55.3. While lead time remains consistently at 0, the forecast must be aggressively adjusted downward to avoid excessive holding costs from the high on-hand inventory (125 units). I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent sharp decline and default for sigma_hat to maintain a baseline safety buffer while the new regime stabilizes. Historical lead time is confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand downturn confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~123 (P9-P14) to ~55 (P15-P17), a decrease of over 50%.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a peak around Period 13, demand dropped sharply in Periods 16 (43), 17 (39), and rebounded slightly in 18 (78). The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P15-P18: 84, 43, 39, 78) is approximately 61 units, confirming the downturn identified in Carry-over Insights for Period 18. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the recent upward tick in Period 18, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current lower demand regime (avg ~61) and its associated volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally maintain a high service level, which is appropriate for this SKU.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to track in a lower regime compared to the mid-game peak. Observations from Period 15 to Period 19 show demand values of 84, 43, 39, 78, and 43. The mean of these last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 57.4 units/period, which aligns with the 'significant demand downturn' noted in the carry-over insights starting at Period 18. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am setting L to default (0) and mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (N=5). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent window (N=5) to capture current volatility without being influenced by the earlier high-demand spikes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 100-120 units, but starting from Period 15, there has been a sustained downturn. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. For the last 6 periods (P15-P20), the demand values are 84, 43, 39, 78, 43, and 51, resulting in a mean of approximately 56.33 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the full history would significantly overestimate demand and lead to excessive holding costs. L is set to default as the promised and actual lead times are 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand downturn sustained: P15-P20 mean demand is ~56 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~123.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1051.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 15. Over the last 7 periods (P15-P21), the mean demand is approximately 56.4 units (84, 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57). This is a sharp contrast to the earlier regime (P9-P14) which averaged ~123. Recent demand (P19-P21) is 43, 51, 57, showing a slight uptick but remaining within the low-demand regime (~50-60 range). Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs on this lower demand, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand stability (P15-P21). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime starting from Period 15. The recent demand samples are: P15: 84, P16: 43, P17: 39, P18: 78, P19: 43, P20: 51, P21: 57, and P22: 42. Comparing the last 8 periods (P15-P22), the mean demand is approximately 54.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 21 regarding the sustained downturn. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this specific low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using these parameters allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer (z* ~ 1.94 for the given profit/holding cost) while avoiding excessive holding costs from overstocking in this lower demand environment.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 15. Over the last nine periods (P15-P23), the mean demand is approximately 57.8 units/period (84, 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80). Period 23 saw a slight uptick to 80 units, but the overall trend remains significantly lower than the previous ~120 units/period regime. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. With an ending on-hand inventory of only 4 units and no units in transit, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on this recent regime (N=9) to avoid over-ordering based on older, higher-demand periods while capturing the recent rebound in Period 23. Lead time (L) remains at the default of 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to occupy the low-demand regime identified around Period 15. Since Period 15, the mean demand is approximately 55 units per period (P15-P24), significantly lower than the P9-P14 regime (~123). Recent demand has shown some fluctuations (e.g., 80 in P23, 34 in P24), but stays well within the expected bounds of this lower regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage holding costs while ensuring a high service level for this high-margin product (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (P15-P24), which accurately reflects the current regime's mean and volatility. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1274.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 15 to Period 25 has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 52.6 units/period (compared to earlier regimes of ~100 or ~123). Over the last 11 periods (N=11), demand has ranged from 34 to 80, with recent periods (P23-P25) showing 80, 34, and 68 respectively. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To optimize the service level for a high-profit item (Profit: $19, Holding: $1) while accounting for the lower mean and current volatility, I am setting L to default (0) and using a 11-period window (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior precisely. This will prevent overstocking from the high-demand periods (P9-P14) while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent volatility seen in Period 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a potential new upward shift or at least a significant spike in Period 26 (demand of 106), following a sustained low-demand regime (mean ~56 from Period 15-25). This spike led to a stockout (on-hand is 0). While the Carry-Over Insights emphasize the previous downturn, recent data (P23-P26: 80, 34, 68, 106) suggests increasing volatility and a rising mean. To prevent further stockouts and adapt quickly, I am shifting from a long-term average to a 'recent_N' approach where N=6 (Periods 21-26). This captures the recent trend and the significant Period 26 demand while filtering out the extremely low demand from the earlier part of the downturn regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed increasing from Period 23; Period 26 demand (106) represents a significant upward deviation from the P15-P25 average (~56).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand spiked to 125, following a significant increase to 106 in Period 26, confirming a clear upward regime shift from the previous low-demand period (P15-P25 avg ~56). The system has stocked out for two consecutive periods (Ending Inventory = 0), and currently has 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0. To recover service levels and capture the new higher demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27: 68, 106, 125), resulting in a mean of 99.6. Given the high volatility (sigma) observed during these spikes, I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent 125 peak. This proactive adjustment is necessary to prevent continued stockouts in Period 28.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Demand increased from ~56 (P15-P25) to over 100 units/period (P26=106, P27=125). Consecutive stockouts occurring.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering a new high-demand regime, confirmed over the last three periods (P26: 106, P27: 125, P28: 107). The previous regime (P15-P25) averaged ~56 units, while the current window (P26-P28) averages ~113 units. Stockouts occurred in P26 and P27 because our inventory levels were pegged to the lower historical mean. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0. To capture this upward shift and prioritize service level (given the high profit margin of $19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher volatility associated with this surge. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the elevated demand levels and provides a buffer against the high variance observed in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2189.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upward starting at Period 26. In the last four periods (P26-P29), demand was 106, 125, 107, and 116, resulting in a mean of 113.5 units/period. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P15-P25) which averaged ~56. Two stockouts occurred at P26 and P27 before the order volume was adjusted. Inventory is currently low (15 units on-hand). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To respond to this established high-demand regime, I will use a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current level and volatility (std dev of P26-P29 is ~8.7). This ensures the base stock level is sufficiently high to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (High) confirmed: Period 26-29 mean demand is ~114 units/period (compared to previous ~56), representing a ~100% increase.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-regime starting at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30), the demand values are [106, 125, 107, 116, 117], yielding a mean of 114.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 7.6. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. We continue to observe a lead time of 0 periods (order arrives and is available for sale within the same period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95th percentile). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this current regime's characteristics while filtering out the previous low-demand period (P15-P25). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume regime starting from Period 26. The mean demand for this recent regime (P26-P31) is approximately 120 units/period (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148). The most recent demand (P31) of 148 units resulted in a stockout, as the starting on-hand inventory of 128 was fully depleted. This indicates that volatility is high and the current stock levels are insufficient for the spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the stockout and capitalize on high profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the high-regime mean (~120) and setting sigma_hat using the same period to account for the recent volatility (range 106-148). This will increase the base stock level to prevent further lost sales during this upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime mean for P26-P31 is 119.8 units/period, confirming a sustained high-demand phase. Recent peak demand of 148 (P31) suggests volatility remains a primary risk.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains active with high mean and significant volatility. For Period 33, I have 48 units on-hand and an observed lead time of 0 periods. The mean demand for the current regime (P26-P32) is approximately 116.7 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98). Although Period 32 demand was lower (98), the previous period (P31) hit 148, indicating volatility remains high. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95), I will use the recent 7-period window (P26-P32) to set my parameters, which captures the current high-demand state and its associated variance. L remains at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2136.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 26. The mean demand for this recent regime (Periods 26-33) is approximately 116.6 units per period. Recent observations (P31: 148, P32: 98, P33: 114) confirm sustained high demand and significant volatility, which has caused stockouts in P26, P27, and P31. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current regime effectively, I am using a recent_N of 8 (covering P26-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~117) and the increased variance. With profit=$19 and holding cost=$1, the target service level is high (~95%), so capturing the recent volatility is crucial to minimize stockout risk while the 0-period lead time allows for responsive ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-demand phase that started in Period 26. Analyzing the recent history (P26-P34), the mean demand is approximately 117 units/period (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98, 114, 122). Volatility is high, with demand reaching as high as 148. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the recent 9 periods (P26-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this specific regime's behavior and set a safety stock level sufficient to cover the spikes observed in this period, such as the 148 in Period 31. The current on-hand inventory is low (20), so the order needs to be robust to prevent another stockout during this high-demand phase.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26, moving from a mean of ~56 to a current high-demand mean of ~114-120 units/period. Period 35 demand was lower (88), but recent volatility (P31: 148, P34: 122) suggests we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts, which have been frequent in this new regime (P26, P27, P31). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P26-P35) while maintaining responsiveness to the most recent data points. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) encourages a high service level, which these parameters will support.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P26-P35) mean is approximately 114.4 units/period with significant volatility (Std Dev ~18). Lead time remains 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26, moving from a mean of ~56 to a high-demand phase averaging ~114 units/period. However, the most recent three periods (P34-P36) show a descending trend: 122, 88, and 67. Period 36's demand (67) is the lowest in the current regime, suggesting a possible cooling off or high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P26-P36) to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and standard deviation, but I'll monitor for a potential downward shift. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to reflect the current regime's higher volume and volatility compared to the full history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 26. The mean demand for the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is approximately 108.6 units/period. While recent demand (P36: 67, P37: 95) is slightly lower than the regime peak (P31: 148), the overall regime is significantly higher than the previous low-demand period (~56). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the historical volatility (spikes over 140), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current regime mean and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the actual variance observed in this high-demand phase. This ensures the base stock calculation sufficiently covers potential demand spikes while reflecting the higher average throughput.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 26. The mean demand for this regime (P26-P38) is approximately 108.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Recent periods (P36-P38) show demand of 67, 95, and 108, which are slightly below the earlier peak of 148 but still align with the high-regime mean. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the entire game. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (35 units) and lead time is 0, I will set mu_hat to capture the average of the current regime (N=13 for P26-P38) to ensure the base stock calculation targets around 110 units plus a safety buffer for the 20+ unit standard deviation. This protects against stockouts while managing holding costs for the high-margin SKU (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2379.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P39), the mean demand is approximately 110.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21. Period 39 demand (126) confirms the continuation of this high-volume/high-volatility stage. With an on-hand inventory of only 15 units and a consistent 0-period lead time (meaning orders arrive in the same period they are placed), the target base stock must cover the full Period 40 demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), necessitating a safety stock to buffer against the volatility observed (max demand recently reached 148). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P26-P39) to prioritize the current regime's statistics and L=0 to reflect the stable delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P26-P39 mean is 110.5 units/period with sustained high volatility (Std Dev ~21). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2338.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been consistently high since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 111.4 units/period (P26-P40). Period 40 demand was 124, slightly above this mean, following a Period 39 demand of 126. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. Given the high criticality of stockouts (profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1) and sustained volatility (standard deviation ~21), I will use the recent 15-period window (P26-P40) to calibrate parameters. Setting L=0 explicitly and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on this recent high-demand regime ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 95th percentile of demand (~146 units), providing sufficient buffer against recent spikes like P31 (148) and P39-40 (~124-126).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the high-demand regime established at Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 108.4 units per period (P26-P41). Period 41 demand dropped to 78, which is slightly below the recent average but within the expected volatility (Standard Deviation ~21 since P26). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the current regime length (N=16, from P26 to P41) to capture the sustained high demand. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same N to account for the observed volatility in this regime. L will remain at 'default' (promised 0) as there is no evidence of delay.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains active, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 111 units and sustained volatility. The period 43 order will face a 0-period lead time, meaning it arrives the same period. Since high demand spikes (up to 148 units) occur frequently in this regime, I will continue using a recent_N approach (N=17, covering P26-P42) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the target service level and the risk of stockouts during volatility peaks, while lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1119.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues within the high-demand regime established around Period 26. Since P26, the mean demand is approximately 110 units/period, but recent demand (P41-P43) has shown a slight softening (78, 95, 63). However, volatility remains high (Std Dev ~20-22), and with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1, the target service level is high (95%). Calculated lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the high volatility while acknowledging the recent lower demand points, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the high-demand regime from P26 onwards) to maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=18 as well to capture the regime's characteristic variance, ensuring we don't under-order if demand spikes again to the 120+ range observed in P39-P40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1058.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime desde Period 26 has been high but shows signs of a downward shift in the most recent 4 periods (P41-P44) with demands of 78, 95, 63, and 60 respectively. The mean for P26-P40 was approximately 110.5, whereas the mean for the last 4 periods is ~74. However, volatility remains a concern. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=15 to balance the high-demand history with the recent drop, ensuring we don't under-order if the drop is temporary, while acknowledging the softening demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=15 to capture recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand downturn starting Period 41: Mean demand decreased from ~110 (P26-P40) to ~74 (P41-P44), a ~33% decrease over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2457.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, demand unexpectedly spiked to 130, despite a potential downturn signal noted in previous periods (P41-P44 average was ~74). This suggests the high-demand regime is still active or that volatility remains extremely high. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P26-P45) is approximately 107.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 21.0. Given the low on-hand inventory of 13 units and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods (P26-P45) to capture this regime's characteristics. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 45 conclude'.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary risk: Period 45 spike (130) follows a 4-period lull (avg ~74), suggesting the high-demand regime (P26-P45 mean ~107.5) has not ended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1796.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. In Period 45, we saw a spike to 130, followed by a return to 97 in Period 46. The high-demand regime that began around Period 26 is still active, with a mean demand of approximately 107.5 units and a high standard deviation. Because the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, I am setting L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 (covering Periods 27-46) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean (~109 over this specific window) and the risk of spikes (Std Dev ~22), balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost by targeting a high service level.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2296.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 26. Recent demand data (P45: 130, P46: 97, P47: 122) confirms that the lower demand observed between P41-P44 was a temporary lull rather than a regime shift. The mean demand for the current regime (P26-P47) is approximately 107.5 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 21. Given the high criticality (Profit 19 vs Holding 1), it is vital to maintain a high service level to prevent stockouts, especially as we approach the final periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (22). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 22 periods (since the regime shift at P26) to capture this sustained high-demand period accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1457.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the current regime that started around Period 26. Recent demand data (P45-P48: 130, 97, 122, 80) shows that while there are lower-demand periods, spikes are frequent and significant. The mean demand for the high-demand regime (P26-P48) is approximately 108.6 units with a standard deviation of 20.8. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 19/20 = 0.95), the system should prioritize a high service level to prevent stockouts during demand spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=23) to capture this entire high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=23) to reflect the observed volatility. L remains at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2238.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the current regime that started around Period 26. While Period 41-44 showed a lull (~74 units), demand spiked again to 130 in Period 45 and 119 in Period 49. The mean demand for the high-demand regime (P26-P49) is approximately 107.5 units/period with a significant standard deviation (~20). Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-period), I will set L to 0. To capture the current volatility and mean while smoothing out the most recent fluctuations, I'll use recent_N with N=24 (covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 26 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the sustained mean and the risk of spikes.
