The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival phase and be available to meet this period's demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must place an order immediately to avoid stockouts. To cover the expected demand for the current period (averaging ~100) and establish a small buffer (safety stock) against high-end demand (Period 2 was 130), I will order 130 units. This allows me to meet the probable demand while minimizing potential excessive holding costs if demand hits the lower end (50-70 range).",
