Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no history or conclude messages to analyze. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples for Periods 1-5 (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) show a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 32.7. Given the Lead Time is 0, the review period + lead time is (0+1) = 1. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the average of the provided samples (rounded to 100) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat based on the observed volatility (33) to ensure the initial order covers the expected demand for the first period. Since L=0 is promised and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 100 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time=0 confirmed by 'Period 1 conclude'), resulting in 100 units on-hand. Demand was 89, leaving 11 units. Historical demand across the first 5 samples provided shows a mean of 99.8 (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), while Period 1 demand was 89. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate the confirmed lead time of 0, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the variability shown in the provided historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, on-hand inventory is 53 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 89 and 41, with an overall average of 65. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been confirmed by the arrival history in Periods 1 and 2 (orders arrived same-period). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5) suggests a base stock targeting the median demand. I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time to average observed lead times (both 0) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=2 to react to the available local history while the system stabilizes. This will target approximately 1 period of demand (L+1 = 1) minus current on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (demand=91, sold=65, ending on-hand=0) due to an under-ordered amount based on previous signals. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown significant volatility: P1 (89), P2 (41), P3 (91), and historical samples (P1: 118, P2: 130, P3: 72, P4: 58, P5: 121). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there's nothing in-transit, we need to restock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while relying on the backend to handle the standard deviation using all available data to account for the high volatility. Since lead time is zero and profit/holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I'll stick to L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 4 concluded periods. However, inventory has hit zero in the last two periods (P3 and P4) due to stockouts, as demand exceeded on-hand inventory + immediate arrivals. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (Note: Game History demand reflects fulfilled demand/sales constrained by stock, while 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt provides true demand). The demand mean is approximately 100 with a standard deviation of 31. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0) if using default stats. To prevent further stockouts, I will use a larger N=5 to capture the full variance of the provided samples and ensure mu_hat reflect the average demand of ~100 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 5 periods, the actual lead time is consistently 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand has shown systemic stockouts in periods 3, 4, and 5 because the initial 'mu_hat' and on-hand inventory were insufficient. The average demand across all periods is approximately 82.6 units (89, 41, 91, 95, 97). However, there is a clear upward trend/shift in demand starting from Period 3 (avg ~94.3 for the last 3 periods) compared to the earlier noise. Since the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5; however, given the stockouts, I need to ensure mu_hat reflects the higher recent demand regime to prevent lost sales. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this recent higher demand trend (approx 94 units/period) while keeping lead time at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 3 onwards: mean demand increased from ~65 to ~94 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we face a critical situation with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory after four consecutive periods of stockouts (Periods 3-6). The 'Carry-over Insight' and game history confirm a demand regime shift starting in Period 3. Historical demand for the last 4 periods has been remarkably stable and high: 91, 95, 97, 91 (sold) / 96 (demand). The mean demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 94.75 units. Despite the promised lead time of 0, our recent orders were too low because we were likely using a mean based on the lower early-period demand (Period 1: 118, Period 2: 130 were outliers, but then it dropped to 72 and 58 in the provided samples before spiking again). Based on the most recent 4 periods of consistent high-demand regime (approx 95/period), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this shift. Sigma is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current low volatility at this higher mean. Lead time (L) remains 0 (default) as verified by the 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed from Period 3 onwards: demand stabilized at a mean of ~95 units (Periods 3-6) compared to the initial volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout scenario with 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The history confirms a promised lead time (L) of 0 is being met consistently. However, demand has shifted significantly. Initial periods (1-2) had erratic demand, while a stable, higher demand regime emerged from Period 3 onwards. Analyzing demand from Period 3 to Period 7: (91, 95, 97, 96, 112). The mean demand over these last 5 periods is 98.2 units. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 8.13. Since we have been stocking out (sold units = on-hand units while demand was higher) in Periods 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, we are currently under-ordering. Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation reflects current needs (approx 98 units for a 0-lead time environment).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 3-7 mean demand is 98.2 units, significantly higher than earlier periods and leading to consistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level than initially observed. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 3-8), the mean demand is 96.83 units (91, 95, 97, 96, 112, 90). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. This means the system must cover the current period's demand entirely with the order placed in the decision phase. Since holding cost is equal to profit ($1.00 each), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, which targets the median of the distribution. However, given that we have consistently faced stockouts until Period 8, I will use a window of the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to accurately capture this higher demand regime and ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet current demand levels while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While Periods 1-2 saw lower/fluctuating demand, Periods 3-9 have established a much higher baseline. Specifically, demand in the last 7 periods (P3-P9) has averaged 104.5 units, with a notable spike to 141 in the most recent period (P9). Consequently, there have been frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 6 of the last 7 periods). Lead time remains consistently 0. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5. To capture the recent shift and the P9 spike, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat (to cover the high-demand regime) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in this period. Setting L to default as actual lead time consistently matches promised lead time (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean further increased: Periods 3-9 average is 104.5 units per period (+7% vs previous estimate), with significant volatility (P9 demand reached 141).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 3. Analyzing demand from Period 3 to Period 10, the mean is approximately 103 units per period (sums to 822 over 8 periods). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P7-P10) show a mean of 110.75 units with significant volatility (std ~22), particularly noted by the spike to 141 in Period 9 and 100 in Period 10. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the game history (orders arrive same period). Given that Profit ($1) is equal to Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the mean demand. However, because we have been frequently stocking out (ending inventory of 0 in 7 out of 10 periods), I need to use 'recent_N' to capture this higher mean and ensure mu_hat reflects the current regime. I will use N=8 to cover the stabilized period since P3, capturing the elevated demand levels while smoothing the P9 spike.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 12. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift after Period 2. The mean demand for Periods 3-11 is approximately 101.2 units per period (91, 95, 97, 96, 112, 90, 141, 100, 89), compared to the earlier periods. Period 9 showed a significant spike (141). There is currently an on-hand inventory of 14 units and no items in transit. To set the OR parameters for Period 12, I'm focusing on the recent regime (N=9, corresponding to Periods 3-11) as it better reflects the current higher demand level and its volatility compared to the total historical average. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~101 units while accounting for the high standard deviation observed in recent weeks, minimizing stockouts which have been frequent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. Demand is exhibiting a high-growth or high-volatility regime. Period 12 saw a peak demand of 153 units, leading to a stockout despite ordering 88. Historical analysis shows a clear shift starting from Period 3; the mean demand from Period 3 to Period 12 is approximately 106.5 units, but the most recent 3 periods (10-12) average 114 units, with a very high std. dev driven by the P12 spike. Given a profit (P) of 1.0 and holding cost (H) of 1.0, the target service level q = P/(P+H) is 0.5. However, because demand has frequently exceeded my orders and stockouts are occurring, I need to capture the recent volatility to prevent lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to cover the post-shift regime (starting P3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Promised lead time L=0 is consistently observed. Setting N=10 for mu_hat will reflect the ~106 mean while acknowledging the recent 153 spike in the sigma_hat calculation to buffer against future surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 12 reached a new high of 153 units, pushing the 10-period rolling average (P3-P12) to 106.5 units with significant upside risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 9-13) shows a significant upward trend and increased volatility, with demand values of 141, 100, 89, 153, and 130. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 122.6 units. The inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, so L remains 0. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At this service level, the base stock should roughly equal the mean demand. However, because we have consistently experienced stockouts (demand often exceeding starting on-hand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistics from the last 5 periods (mean ~122.6) to set the base stock and replenish inventory immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 9-13 mean demand increased to ~123 units (+15.5% vs P3-P12 average), characterized by high volatility (IQR approx 40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the conclusion of Period 14. However, demand continues to be highly volatile and has shifted to a higher regime. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the mean demand is approximately 118.3 units (141, 100, 89, 153, 130, 97). The Carry-over insight from P14 highlighted a recent mean of ~123 units for the P9-P13 window. Although P14 saw a slightly lower demand of 97, the volatility remains high (StdDev ~25-30). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but because lead time is 0 (order arrives before demand), any units on hand at the start of the period are purely to satisfy that period's demand. I will set mu_hat using the recent 6 periods to capture the current high-demand regime and use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed recently, ensuring the OR backend's cap doesn't inadvertently constrain the order in the face of potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P9-P14 is 118.3 units with high volatility (range 89-153).

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we review the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. In Period 15, demand was 84, continuing a slight downward trend from the high of 153 in Period 12. However, the 'Period 14-Period 15' period still shows a mean demand of 118.3 units since Period 9. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period). The current on-hand inventory is 35 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent high volatility (ranging from 84 to 153), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 9-15) to reflect the mean of approximately 113. Additionally, I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility of this higher demand state, ensuring the safety stock accounts for the recent distribution without over-penalizing for the lower demand seen in the very early periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand dropped significantly to 43 units, following a lower-than-average demand of 84 in Period 15. This suggests a potential shift away from the high-demand regime (mean ~118-123) observed between Periods 9-14. The last 3 periods (P14-P16) have an average demand of 74.6 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, it is critical to avoid overstocking. The current on-hand inventory is 71 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the recent deceleration in demand (P12-P16 mean: 101.4) while still providing some buffer against previous volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe a significant shift in demand over the last three periods (P15-P17: 84, 43, 39) compared to the preceding high-demand regime (P9-P14 mean: ~118). The recent average is approximately 55 units, indicating a sharp downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs in this lower-demand environment, I am reducing mu_hat by using a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture the recent decline while still accounting for some of the earlier volatility. I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) as well to adjust for the change in variance associated with this lower demand level. This approach balances the risk of rapid stock reduction against the need to satisfy demand if the drop is temporary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand decreased significantly from ~118 units to ~55 units (last 3 periods average) after a peak period of high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) was 43, 39, and 78 respectively, averaging 53.3 units. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (P9-P15) which averaged ~118 units. Period 18 saw a relative spike to 78, but the overall trend remains substantially lower than the mid-game peak. With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently observed as 0, the objective is to cover the current period's demand without overstocking, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to the profit ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new lower-demand regime while weighting the recent uptick in Period 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~118 units to ~53 units (P16-P18 average), a 55% reduction.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 19, the observed values are 43, 39, 78, and 43. This averages to 50.75 units per period, which is a significant reduction (approx. 55%) from the previous regime's average (~118 units). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has high inventory sensitivity because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), resulting in a target service level of 50%. This means the OR backend should target the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower regime precisely. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the recently observed volatility in this new lower-demand state.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a high-demand phase (~118 units) to a much lower level. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 50.8 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51). While there was a slight uptick in P18, the overall trend remains significantly lower than the P9-P15 period. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this new, lower demand regime (mean ~51). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history, so I am using the 'default' method for L. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the service level target q logic in the backend (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) naturally targets a 50th percentile (the median), which is appropriate given the relatively stable recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand for P16-P20 is 50.8 units, a ~57% decrease from the previous regime (P9-P15 avg ~118.3).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a lower regime starting from Period 16. The demand values for the last six periods (P16-P21) are 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, and 57, resulting in a mean of approximately 51.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be consistently met, as evidenced by all orders arriving within the same period they were placed. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, having just stocked out in P21 due to demand (57) slightly exceeding our order (51). To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs (as Profit and Holding costs are equal at $1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (1 / (1 + 1)). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend generates an appropriate base stock to cover current requirements.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 16-22), demand has averaged 50.4 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42). Although Period 18 saw a relative spike (78), the overall trend remains stable at this lower level compared to the previous high-demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To minimize holding costs while meeting demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7 to capture the regime since Period 16). With profit = $1.0 and holding cost = $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate using these parameters.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 23: [43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80]. The mean of this recent regime (N=8) is 54.125 units per period. Period 23 saw a spike to 80 units, which resulted in a stockout. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the OR backend aims to set the base stock at the median. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower but slightly volatile demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 53 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). While Period 23 saw a spike to 80, Period 24 returned to a much lower 34. The current on-hand inventory is 21 units with no units in transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current regime (N=9), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the mean (~52.4) and volatility of this specific phase. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level target (q) calculated by the OR backend is 0.5. Given lead time is 0, the base stock will target the median of the current demand distribution to balance the risks of stockouts and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of approximately 53.5 units (P16-P25 average). Recent demand (P23: 80, P24: 34, P25: 68) shows increased volatility compared to the earlier quiet phase of this regime. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 10-period window (P16-P25) to capture the current regime's mean while accounting for the recent uptick in volatility to prevent stockouts like those seen in P21, P23, and P25.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P25 stabilized with a mean of 53.5 units; however, volatility has increased in the last 3 periods (std dev approx 23 vs earlier 11), suggesting a wider distribution within the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a potential new regime shift or significant spike in volatility. Period 26 demand was 106, which is nearly double the mean of the P16-P25 regime (53.5). While the carry-over insight noted a mean of 53.5 with increased volatility, the sudden jump to 106 necessitates a more responsive forecasting approach to avoid stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use a recent_N approach with N=11 (P16-P26) to capture the stable period plus the recent surge, which effectively increases the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to account for the current upward pressure. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift or significant volatility spike at Period 26: demand jumped to 106 units, compared to the P16-P25 average of 53.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a significant upward shift in demand. After a long period of localized stability around ~53 units (Periods 16-25), demand in Period 26 jumped to 106 and Period 27 reached 125. This clearly indicates a new high-demand regime, possibly seasonal or a trend shift similar to the one seen in Periods 9-14. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0. Since profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are identical, the target cycle service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Using N=3 for the recent shift captures Periods 25-27 (68, 106, 125), resulting in a mean of 99.6 units per period. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-volatility window to ensure enough inventory is ordered to meet this resurgent demand while acknowledging the increased uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean demand has increased from ~53 units (P16-P25) to ~115 units (P26-P27 average), representing a >100% increase. The trend is currently upward (106 to 125).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) has been 106, 125, and 107 units, respectively. This gives a mean demand of 112.67 units for this new regime, which is more than double the previous regime's average (approx 53.5). The stock has been consistently depleted (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods) because orders were based on the old regime's parameters. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this new higher demand level effectively and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the OR engine's forecast to this current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~53.5 (P16-P25) to 112.7 (P26-P28), a 110% increase, with sustained high volume across three consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. Before Period 26, the mean demand was approximately 53 units. From Period 26 to Period 29, the demand recorded was 106, 125, 107, and 116 units, respectively. This results in a new mean of approximately 113.5 units over the last 4 periods, which is more than double the previous regime's average. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all 'Period conclude' messages. Since we are currently at Period 30 and the on-hand inventory is 0, it is critical to set parameters that reflect this new high-demand regime to avoid further stockouts. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this specific new regime. Setting mu_hat to reflects the mean demand of ~113.5 and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility (standard deviation ~8.3) within these 4 periods ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that satisfies the new demand level at the desired service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. Before this, the mean demand was approximately 53.5 units (Periods 16-25), but the last five periods (P26-P30) have seen demands of 106, 125, 107, 116, and 117. This establishes a new, stable high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 114.2 units per period (N=5). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this new mean demand of ~114 units, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the variance in this new regime. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current high demand while minimizing stockouts seen in the transition periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~53.5 (P16-P25) to 114.2 (P26-P30), a ~113% increase, with demand stabilizing around the 115 unit mark over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 26. For the last six periods (P26-P31), the mean demand is approximately 119.8 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148). The most recent period (P31) saw a further spike to 148 units, suggesting possible continued upward volatility or a new shelf. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime median, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility (StdDev ~15.2) observed during this period. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for the recent variance to maintain the service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand for P26-P31 is ~119.8 units, a >100% increase from the P16-P25 average. Period 31 demand (148) suggests a potential further increase in mean or volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 26. For the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the mean demand is approximately 116.7 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98), compared to the previous regime's average of ~53.5. High volatility remains present, particularly with the spike to 148 in Period 31. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand regime while allowing for the observed volatility (standard deviation for P26-P32 is approx 17.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant data for the current high-demand state.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime shifted at Period 26 from a mean of ~53 units to a much higher level. For the most recent period (P26-P33), mean demand is approximately 116.6 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized around this range (P32: 98, P33: 114). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use N=8 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and the observed volatility, minimizing stockouts which have been frequent.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 26. For the period range P26-P34 (last 9 periods), the mean demand is approximately 117 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98, 114, 122). The recent history shows relative stability around this new mean, although individual periods like P31 (148) and P32 (98) indicate sustained volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (as inferred from all historical 'conclude' messages), I am setting L to 'default' (0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistics of this current regime (P26-P34) accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for recent variance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 26 onwards has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the P16-P25 interval. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 115.7 units (P26-P35), with a standard deviation of about 17.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory currently sits at 29 units on-hand. To capture the current regime's behavior (P26-P35), I will use recent_N with N=10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This N covers the entire duration of the current regime shift from Period 26 to Period 35, ensuring parameters reflect the 100%+ increase in demand while maintaining responsiveness to the observed volatility (standard deviation ~17.5). Setting L to default (0) aligns with historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P26-P35 confirmed stable: mean demand ~116 units, standard deviation ~18 units, reinforcing the 100%+ increase from the P16-P25 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a significant increase. For the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is 111.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8 units. The most recent demand (P36) was 67 units, which is a dip compared to the regime average, but consistent with the volatility observed in this category (IQR and range). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand to balance service level and holding costs. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=11 to capture the full extent of this current high-demand regime while filtering out the older, low-demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring from Period 26 onwards. Between P26 and P37, the mean demand is approximately 110 units. However, the last two periods (P36 and P37) have shown a significant decrease (67 and 95 units respectively) from the high of 148 in P31 or the previous mean of ~117 documented in the carry-over insights. Calculating the mean for the most recent regime (P26-P37), we get 112.9 units. Looking specifically at the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the average is lower at 97.2 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which ideally means we want on-hand inventory to equal the expected demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine will calculate orders to maintain the base stock according to mu_hat. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime (P26-P37) while allowing the slightly lower recent demand to pull the forecast down safely.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 26 onwards has stabilized at a mean of approximately 113.8 units (calculated from Period 26 to Period 38), which is significantly higher than the preceding regime (Period 16-25, mean ~53.5). The most recent three periods (36, 37, 38) show demand of 67, 95, and 108 respectively, showing a slight decrease compared to the peak in Period 31 (148) but remaining within the high-demand regime established in Period 26. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per the history. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering Period 26 to 38) to capture the current demand mean and volatility specifically for this regime. This allows the OR engine to maintain sufficient safety stock for the ~114 unit mean while accounting for the observed standard deviation (approx 21.6 in this segment). Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 shows a mean of 113.8 units (P26-P38) with a standard deviation of ~21.6, maintaining a stable but high-volume pattern compared to earlier periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is well-established, with a mean demand of approximately 114.7 units (Periods 26-39) and a standard deviation of 21.3. Recent demand (Period 39) was slightly higher than average at 126 units, resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To accurately capture the current regime while allowing for recent volatility, I will use a window of 14 periods (N=14, covering P26-P39) for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) calculations. This balances the long-term stable mean of this regime with the observed volatility. With Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will naturally target using these parameters.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is well-established, with an average of approximately 114.5 units per period and a standard deviation of about 21. Recent demand (P39: 126, P40: 124) is slightly above this average but consistent with the established range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'concluded' messages. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering P26-P40) to capture this stable high-demand regime while excluding earlier lower-demand periods. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that targets the 50% service level (Profit = Holding Cost = $1) while accounting for the current regime's volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 remains active, with a mean demand of approximately 111.4 units (P26-P41). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Recent demand in Period 41 (78) was lower than the regime average, leading to ending inventory of 33 units. Since demand is volatile (standard deviation stays around 20-25), I will use a recent_N approach (N=16, covering the current regime from P26-P41) to capture the stable but high-volume mean while allowing the OR backend to account for recent fluctuations. Lead time L is set to 'default' as shipments arrive in the same period they are ordered (L=0).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 110 units. Recent periods (P40-P42) show demands of 124, 78, and 95. The average of the current regime (P26-P42) is 109.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (Profit:Holding = 1:1), I will use the recent regime (last 17 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=17 encompasses the period since the last major regime shift (P26). This ensures the OR backend captures the current volume and volatility without being skewed by the significantly lower demand observed between Periods 16 and 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting from Period 26 has maintained a stable mean, with the most recent data showing a potential softening or sustained volatility. The mean demand from Period 26 to Period 43 is approximately 109.8 units. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43), the mean is 97.2, while the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43) average 100.1. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilization around the 100-unit mark while accounting for the recent high volatility (std dev ~22). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 100 units while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 has stabilized further, with Period 34-43 mean at 100.1 units and standard deviation of 22.1, showing a slight decrease in mean compared to the initial Period 26-34 peak (~117).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has been characterized by a higher mean compared to the P16-P25 period. However, recent data (Periods 41-44) shows a stabilization at a slightly lower level than the initial P26-P34 peak. Demand for the last 4 periods was 78, 95, 63, and 60 respectively, resulting in a mean of 74 units. This is a significant decrease from the ~100-117 unit mean observed in the preceding block. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (since Profit=Holding=$1.0, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend logic with cap and base stock usually provides more buffer), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-volume history of the current regime from P26 onwards with the very recent downward trend. L remains 0 as verified by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 41: Mean demand decreased to ~74.0 units (P41-P44) from the previous P34-P43 average of ~100.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 41. While Period 45 saw a spike to 130, the preceding four periods (P41-P44) averaged 74.0 units, contrasting with the previous stable average of ~100. Despite the single-period spike in P45, I will prioritize recent data to reflect this downward shift while accounting for high volatility (std dev of P41-P45 is approx 27). The promised lead time of 0 remains consistent with actual arrival history. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent regime change and current volatility spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected lower mean while buffering against the demonstrated high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~85.2 units (P41-P45) from previous ~100 units, but with significantly increased volatility (P45 spike to 130).

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a transitional state. A regime shift was identified at Period 41, with mean demand decreasing from ~100 to ~85 units. However, recent volatility is high: Period 45 saw a spike to 130 and Period 46 recorded 97, both of which were near or above the available inventory, leading to stockouts. The Period 41-46 average is now 83.8 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Given that lead time is 0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean. To protect against the observed high volatility (Standard Deviation for P41-P46 is ~25) and prevent further lost sales during this end-of-game phase, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average of ~84 units and an explicit sigma_hat of 25 to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to handle demand spikes like the one seen in Period 45.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased during the Period 41 regime: P41-P46 mean is 83.8 with a standard deviation of ~25 units, significantly higher than the initial transition suggested.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 41 has shown significant volatility. While the mean demand for the period P41-P47 is approximately 92.1 units, the last three periods (P45-P47) have seen a consecutive increase in demand (130, 97, 122), averaging 116.3 units. This volatility suggests the downward shift originally noted at P41 was either temporary or is being overridden by a new upward trend or high-variance state. Given we are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining, and profit equals holding cost (1.0 each), the target service level is 50%. However, consistent stockouts in P45-P47 (ending inventory 0) indicate that a 'recent_N' approach focusing on this high-volatility window is necessary to prevent lost sales in the final stretch. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the shift from Period 41, but use a more recent N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the most recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly from Period 45 onwards: mean demand for P45-P47 is 116.3 (vs P41-P44 mean of 74.0), causing consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent periods. While the period P41-P44 showed a clear dip (mean ~74), the subsequent periods (P45-P48) have experienced a sharp rebound with demand values of 130, 97, 122, and 80 (mean ~107.3). This recent surge has caused several stockouts (P45-P47). To avoid further stockouts while responding to this high volatility, I am shifting the focus to the last 8 periods (P41-P48) to capture both the dip and the surge, providing a balanced but responsive forecast. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the base stock formula, but the OR backend's inventory policy (including the z-score for the cap) will allow for a safety buffer. Setting L=0 as promised, mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (mean ~96), and sigma_hat to reflect the high recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified from Period 45: mean demand for P45-P48 is 107.3, compared to 74.3 in P41-P44, representing a 44% increase in the short term.

Daily Profit: $91.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While Period 41-44 suggested a decrease to ~74 units, demand has since spiked and remained high, averaging ~109 units over the last 5 periods (P45-P49: 130, 97, 122, 80, 119). Due to recurrent stockouts and the high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 21), a higher safety stock is necessary. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this latest high-demand cluster and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility and prevent stockouts, given the equal weight of profit and holding cost (z* = 0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand volatility since Period 45: Mean demand for P45-P49 is 109.6 units, reflecting a 47% increase from the P41-P44 average (74.3) and marking a return to the Period 26-40 regime levels.
