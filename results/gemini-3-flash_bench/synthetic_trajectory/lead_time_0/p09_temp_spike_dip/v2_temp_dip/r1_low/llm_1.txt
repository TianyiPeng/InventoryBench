Historical data shows an average demand of approximately 100 units (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), with a standard deviation of about 33. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive during the same period and are available for demand resolution. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 1.
