Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows demand for 5 periods: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. The mean demand is 99.8 units per period. Since this is the very first decision period (N=1) and the promised lead time is 0, the OR backend needs to estimate demand for (1+L) = (1+0) = 1 period. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (the length of the provided sample history) to capture the base demand profile. The high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) implies a target service level of 50%, so the OR engine will lean towards a lean inventory unless variability is high.

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 100 units based on the promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 periods (order arrived and was sold in the same period). Demand for Period 1 was 114, which exceeded our supply of 100, resulting in 14 lost sales. The historical demand for this SKU over the last 5 periods has been [118, 130, 72, 58, 121], giving an average of 99.8 units/period. Period 1 demand (114) aligns with this historical variance. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (meaning base stock should roughly equal mean demand). Given the lead time is 0, we need to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to affirm the observed 0-period behavior and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the recent historical mean while accounting for volatility. Currently, on-hand and in-transit are both 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, demand (114, 117) has consistently exceeded the orders placed (100, 99) because the OR backend is likely underestimating the mean demand or reacting too slowly to the initial historical samples (avg ~99.8). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is 0. However, because demand is served after the order arrives in the same period, we are currently stock-out limited (sold = starting on-hand), meaning true demand is higher than units sold. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the average demand of the first 5 samples provided (approx 100) plus a buffer for the recent higher observations (114, 117, and 118, 130 from history) to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N for sigma to capture the volatility of the observed demand.

Daily Profit: $103.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing the first three periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been 114, 117, and 103 (Mean: 111.3). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. In Period 1 and 2, stockouts occurred because the order quantity (based on initial OR logic) was slightly below actual demand. By Period 3, an ending inventory of 12 was achieved. For Period 4, the demand samples are provided as 118, 130, 72, 58, 121. However, the game history shows recent demand as 114, 117, 103. Averaging the available game history demand (N=3) gives ~111. Standard deviation is relatively low. Given the Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize total cost. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term default, while keeping L at default (0) as verified by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 periods, demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently near 110 units (114, 117, 103, 106), with an average of 110. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 6 units with nothing in transit. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the service level target (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the median demand. I will use the mean of the available 4 periods of historical 'conclude' demand data as the forecast for mu_hat. Given the low on-hand stock and the 0-period lead time, we need to order enough now to cover Period 5 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 114 units per period (samples: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132). All five preceding periods confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The profit and holding cost are both $1.0, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight increase in Period 5, so I will use a larger N=5 for smoothing while ensuring enough stock is ordered to prevent future stockouts which occurred in Periods 1, 2, and 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 6 concluded periods. The observed demand values are: P1:114, P2:117, P3:103, P4:106, P5:132, P6:80. The average demand is approximately 108.7 units. The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 (orders placed in P1-P6 arrived in the same period). Current inventory is 35 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level (critical ratio) of 50%. The OR backend's default base stock calculation (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) will naturally target the median if demand is symmetric. Given the volatility (std dev approx 17), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime and ensures the OR backend is responsive to the recent fluctuation (especially the dip to 80 units in P6). Lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand history for the last 7 periods (114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72) suggests a recent softening in demand after Period 5. The average demand across all periods is approximately 103.4, but the average of the last 3 periods is 94.7, and the last 2 periods are significantly lower (Avg=76). Given the equal cost of underage and overage ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the base stock should target the median demand. To avoid overreacting to the recent two-period dip while still acknowledging the downward trend, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand period (P5) with the low-demand periods (P6-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 8 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a fairly stable pattern with a mean demand of approximately 104.25 units and a standard deviation of 19.8 units. Although there was a slight drop in demand in Periods 6 and 7 (average of 76), Period 8 rebounded to 110, suggesting the overall average remains a reliable predictor. I am setting L to the promised lead time (0) and using all 8 available historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using all samples (N=8) provides a better estimate of variability and mean given the lack of a clear, sustained regime shift or seasonal signal in the current data. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers one period of demand (L+1=1) at a service level dictated by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units. Demand has shown some volatility but no clear structural shift since the start of the game. Historical demand values (including pre-game samples) are: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (pre-game) and 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110, 77 (in-game). The mean of all 14 samples is approximately 99.28 with a standard deviation of 22.8. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use 'default' methods to leverage the full sample set for stable mean and variance estimates, as no significant regime change is detected.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-10 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current demand history shows high variability with no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift (Demand samples: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110, 77, 89). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 100 units. Since Profit is $1.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should align with the median/mean of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand distribution accurately and set L to 'default' as it matches the observed 0-period lead time. This ensures we don't overstock given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 11 periods, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (History mean: 100.36). Every order placed so far has arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. The service level (q) target given $1 profit and $1 holding cost is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (mu_hat). With on-hand inventory at only 4 units and no in-transit stock, I need to ensure the parameters trigger an order sufficient to cover Period 12 demand. I will use the last 11 samples (entire game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonality based on the 'Period_N' labels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since Period 1, with a mean demand of approximately 98.6 units and a standard deviation of about 17.8 over the 12 observed periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all 12 orders arrived in the period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (under a base-stock policy) is q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the median demand. Since demand appears to be in a single stable regime, I will use all available history (N=12) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will then calculate the base stock and order enough to reach that level, accounting for the current inventory and the lead time of 0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, fluctuating between 72 and 132 units. The mean demand across all observed periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 96.5 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive the same period they are placed). With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the desired service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Currently, there are 15 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use the recent 13 periods of data to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the early pre-game samples (Period_4 and Period_5 especially) showed lower demand (58, 72) compared to the active game history where demand is more robust. This will ensure the OR backend captures the current stable demand regime while maintaining a lean inventory profile suitable for equal profit/holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 14 periods, with an average demand of approximately 96 units per period. The recent history (Periods 6-14) shows a slight decrease in demand compared to the initial periods, averaging around 88 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period message (ordered and arrived in the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, which implies the base stock should target the median demand (z* = 0). I will use the recent 9 periods (Period 6-14) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N with N=9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 15 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (range 72-134). There was a notable spike in Period 15 (134 units), which depleted inventory to zero. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio for the service level is 0.5, meaning we aim to cover the mean demand. However, the OR backend's capped policy will adjust this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive to the current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods, particularly with a sharp drop in Period 16 (demand=40) following a spike in Period 15 (demand=134). Over the 16 concluded periods, the average demand is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 24 units. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival), the base stock calculation simplifies to mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning z=0 and the target stock level is just mu_hat. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent regime which includes the extreme high and low points, calculating a balanced average that accounts for current on-hand inventory (60 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the last two periods (Period 16: 40, Period 17: 33) compared to the historical average of approximately 95. Prior to Period 16, demand was consistently higher (e.g., Period 15 was 134). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this local downward trend while maintaining some buffer, as two data points are too few for a reliable new regime estimate. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift detected at Period 16: average demand dropped from ~98 (P1-P15) to ~37 (P16-P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower level compared to the initial regime (P1-P15). Although P18 demand recovered slightly to 67 units, it remains significantly below the P1-P15 average of ~98. The demand in the last three periods (P16-P18: 40, 33, 67) averages ~46.7, confirming the southward demand shift noted in carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to focus on this new lower-demand regime while allowing for the volatility seen in P18. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (promised), so L is set to default. This approach balances the need to reduce holding costs (since profit = holding cost = $1.0) while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg decreased from ~98 (P1-P15) to ~47 (P16-P18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 98. From Period 16 to Period 19, the average demand dropped to 46.5 (40, 33, 67, 46). Although Period 18 saw a spike to 67, Period 19 returned to 46, confirming the lower regime is sustained. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 1, in-transit: 0), and with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, given the extreme shift and the need to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining basic availability, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand level (~47 units). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 1 to 15 was approximately 99.8 units, whereas the average demand from Period 16 to 20 has dropped to 49.6 units (decreased by ~50%). Despite this lower average, Period 20 saw a demand of 62 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0) because the starting on-hand plus arrival (1 + 46) was only 47. Inventory levels need to be adjusted to this new regime while providing enough buffer for the volatility observed (range of 33 to 67 in the new regime). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this new lower-demand state. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P16-P21) showed a distinct regime shift, initially dropping to ~47 but now trending upward (P20: 62, P21: 85). The current inventory is 0. I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture this new demand pattern while acknowledging the recent uptick. The mean of the last 6 periods is approximately 55.5; however, given the consecutive increases from 46 to 62 to 85, a slightly higher forecast is prudent to avoid stockouts, as the base-stock logic uses profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5. I'll use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh this latest regime correctly. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased and volatility increased; recent periods (P20-P21) show a potential recovery/uptrend from the initial P16 drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. After a sharp drop in Period 16 (demand: 40, 33, 67, 46), there was signs of recovery in Periods 20 and 21 (demand: 62, 85), followed by another dip in Period 22 (demand: 40). The average demand from Period 16 to 22 is approximately 53.3 units, compared to the pre-shift average of ~100. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the median demand. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this post-shift behavior while accounting for the recent rebound and subsequent dip. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that reflects the lower, more volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime compared to the first 15 periods. Since the major drop at Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 52 units per period (P16-P23: 40, 33, 67, 46, 62, 85, 40, 46). Although there were spikes at P20 and P21, the most recent values (P22-P23) suggest the trend remains around the 45-50 range rather than returning to the ~98 mean of the early phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I will use a recent window of N=8 (the duration of the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current lower demand profile while acknowledging the increased volatility seen in this period compared to the very first few periods of the drop.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility since a major regime shift at Period 16. Initially, demand dropped from a mean of ~98 (P1-P15) to ~47 (P16-P18). Since then, demand has fluctuated between 40 and 85, with a recent spike of 79 in Period 24. Currently, there is zero inventory on-hand and in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent variability and the slight upward trend compared to the initial drop at P16, I will use a recent window of N=9 (P16-P24) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a mean demand of approximately 55 units. Given the high volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this period), using recent_N for sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to avoid stockouts while managing the equal cost-to-profit ratio (Profit=$1, Holding=$1), which implies a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P16-P24): Demand mean ~55, significantly lower than P1-P15 (~98) but exhibiting high variability (range 33-85).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand was 0, which is extremely unusual compared to the current regime mean (~55). However, this follows Period 24 demand of 79 (high for recent history), suggesting high volatility rather than a complete halt in business. The 'Carry-over Insights' from P25 identify the regime from P16-P24 as having a mean of ~55. Including the zero from P25, the mean for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 49.8. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to account for this recent variance (including the zero demand) without overreacting to a single outlier. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to capture the increased volatility noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, which simplified the pipeline inventory. The high holding cost (equal to profit) makes it crucial not to over-order; a lower mu_hat based on the most recent 10-period regime helps balance this risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed extreme demand volatility in the lower regime (P16 onward), with demand dropping to 0 in Period 25 after a peak of 79 in Period 24.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since the regime shift at Period 16. Recent demand values include 79 (P24), 0 (P25), and 114 (P26), making the 'lower regime' theory less about a lower mean and more about significantly higher variance. The average demand from P16 to P26 is approximately 50. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50. At a 50% service level, the base stock should roughly equal the mean demand. However, given the recent 114 demand spike and the fact that we currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to order to cover the upcoming period. I will use the last 11 periods (P16-P26) to define the current regime (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility phase. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime from P16-P26 is characterized by extreme instability (mean ~50, range 0-114) rather than a simple downward shift.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P27) is characterized by extreme volatility and instability, with demand values ranging from 0 to 114 and a mean of approximately 58. Recent demand in P26 and P27 has spiked back to levels seen in the pre-P16 period (114 and 100 respectively). Because Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median demand to minimize total costs. With actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods, I will set L=0. To account for the recent return to high demand while acknowledging the extreme volatility of the current regime, I will use a recent_N of 12 (covering the entire volatile regime since P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this window ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the lower average of the regime and the high variance, preventing extreme stockouts during these new spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand spikes in P26 (114) and P27 (100) suggest the low-demand regime (P16-P25) may be ending or is simply extremely high-variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several shifts. Initially, P1-P15 showed a stable mean around 98. From P16-P25, demand dropped to a volatile lower regime (mean ~50). However, the last three periods (P26-P28) have shown a significant resurgence with demand values of 114, 100, and 117, which matches the initial high-demand regime levels. Given this sustained return to high demand over the last 3 periods, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to reflect this 'recovery' regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest trend and ensure enough stock is ordered to meet this higher demand, while keeping L at default (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period (lead_time 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed at Period 28: Demand in P26-P28 returned to the initial regime levels (avg ~110), ending the low-demand period (P16-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently recovering from a low-demand period (P16-P25). Recent demand values are P26: 114, P27: 100, P28: 117, and P29: 61. This suggests a return to the higher mean observed in P1-P15 (approx. 100) but with sustained high volatility. Period 29's drop to 61 after three periods of ~110 indicates we shouldn't over-order based on the peaks alone. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the recovery starting P26) to capture this 'restored' mean while accounting for the recent variability. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver for the base stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has returned to the higher regime (P1-P15) levels after a low-demand period (P16-P25). Recent demand values demonstrate significant recovery (P26: 114, P27: 100, P28: 117, P29: 61, P30: 133). The average demand of these last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 105, which aligns with the initial pre-drop average (~98). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recovered mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current regime's volatility, which remains high. The lead time is consistently 0 (observed in almost all successful deliveries), so L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed since Period 26: Avg demand P26-P30 is 105, matching the pre-Period 16 regime (~98).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around the original high-demand regime (avg ~100) since Period 26. Historical demand from Period 26-31 shows values of 114, 100, 117, 61, 133, and 84, resulting in a mean of approximately 101.5. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 31 stating that recovery is confirmed. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this current stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend reacts to the average demand of ~102 while accounting for the significant volatility (range 61-133) observed in these recent samples.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its initial high-volume regime after a period of lower, volatile demand (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 96 units, which is consistent with the early-game average (P1-P15) of approximately 98. Recent demand in Period 32 was 62, following a period of 84 (P31) and 133 (P30). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized 'recovered' regime (P26-P32). Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to its original level after a volatile period (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 93 units (114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, 62, 58). Although the most recent three periods (P31-P33) show a slight downward trend (84, 62, 58), this is likely part of the high variance inherent in this SKU rather than a new regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To set OR parameters, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current 'recovery' regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the current mean (~93) and the high volatility observed recently, balancing the high service level required by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target service level = 50% in the base model, but OR logic applies \u03a6\u22121(q)).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime consistent with Periods 1-15 and the recovery observed from Period 26 onwards. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 91 units (Periods 26-34), though it remains volatile (range 58-133). The most recent period (P34) saw demand of 93, resulting in zero ending inventory. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P26-P34) to capture this recovered regime mean while acknowledging the high variance. Lead time 'L' remains consistent at 0 based on all historical concludes. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand level to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs in a high-volatility environment.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around the original higher regime level (average ~98) since approximately Period 26, following a period of extreme volatility and a temporary drop. In the most recent 10 periods (P26-P35), the mean demand is 87.4 with a standard deviation of 30.7. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P31-P35), the mean is 69.8, indicating a slight downward trend or just high variance. The current on-hand inventory is 40. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (base stock = median). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current regime while damping the noise from individual low-demand periods like P35. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to account for the consistently high volatility observed in recent cycles.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its initial regime levels since Period 26, following a volatile dip between Periods 16-25. In the most recent 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 (range 0-133, though the 0 in P25 and subsequent stockouts affect visibility). Recent demand (P34-P36) has been 93, 52, and 94. The ending on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime while accounting for the high volatility observed (std dev is significant), I will use the last 11 samples (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire 'recovery' phase starting from Period 26. Since lead time is 0, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR backend will calculate the order to meet this target.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized back at a high-volume level, with an average of approximately 85.5 units per period (P26-P37). This is a significant recovery from the low-demand period (P16-P25). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently at 26 units with 0 units in transit. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the review+lead period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recovery period since P26 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels respond to the current high-volatility, high-demand environment without being skewed by the old low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime P26-P37: Mean ~85.5 with high variance (range 52-133), confirming full recovery from the P16-P25 dip.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized with a mean around 88 units and significant volatility. Period 38 saw a demand of 105, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I am using a base-stock policy that targets the recent regime mean and variance. I'll use the last 13 periods (P26-P38) to define this regime, as this period marks the recovery from the previous dip. L is set to 0 as confirmed. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N (N=13) to capture the current demand distribution accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime following the recovery in Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 89 units per period, with a range between 52 and 133. This aligns with the pre-Period 16 levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in-transit. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is q = 0.5, which the OR backend approximates using the base-stock policy. To respond to the current regime and allow for the detected volatility, I am using a recent window (N=14) encompassing the data from Period 26 to Period 39 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the forecast is grounded in the current stabilized recovery phase while accounting for recent high-demand peaks (P38: 105, P39: 112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after a period of volatility and a dip between P16-P25. The regime recovery established around P26 has continued through P40, with recent demand (P38-P40) showing values of 105, 112, and 104 respectively. This suggests a current demand mean around 100-110. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Inventory ended at 0 in P40 despite an order of 90 units, indicating stockouts. To maximize profit and meet this higher demand (\u03bc \u2248 100), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture the stable behavior since P26 while filtering out the volatile low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime P26-P40: Mean approximately 90-100 units/period, showing recovery to initial levels (pre-P16) with consistent Lead Time of 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a recovery from a mid-game dip. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 91.1 with a standard deviation of 26.6. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. For Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. Using recent_N (N=16, covering the stable regime since P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend captures this recovered demand level and its associated volatility. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during demand spikes (like Period 41's 129 units) against holding costs in a high-variability environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 38 to 42 shows a clear upward trend and consistently high demand (105, 112, 104, 129, 129), with the last two periods peaking at 129. The demand regime from Period 26 onwards is established, but the most recent 10-15 periods provide the best estimate for the current 'high' recovery state. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recovered mean and the high volatility observed in this regime, while keeping L at default (0) based on perfect historical consistency. This choice ensures we maintain enough inventory (on-hand 0, in-transit 0 currently) to meet the sustained demand of ~100-130 units and avoid stockouts seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a higher level (avg ~110-120) over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), exceeding the previous regime average of ~90.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 38/39, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) showing an average demand of approximately 115.6 units (112, 104, 129, 129, 104). We are currently ending in stockouts frequently (ending inventory is 0 for the last 5 periods), suggesting that our previous parameters were slightly too conservative for this plateau. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward while avoiding stockouts in the final periods of the game (P44-P50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime (P38-P43) and set lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher plateau (avg ~115) from Period 39 to Period 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 39. Over the last six periods (P39-P44), demand values were 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, and 84, resulting in a mean of approximately 110.3 units. This represents a sustained higher plateau compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To account for this stabilized but higher demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture this specific regime. Since lead time is 0, base stock needs to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 39, with an average demand of approximately 110-120 units. Specifically, the last seven periods (P39-P45) show demand values of 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, and 128 (average ~113). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by terminal 'conclude' messages for every order placed. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. To capture the most recent stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the volatility of the earlier P16-P25 period, I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance from the current high-demand state to set the order quantity for Period 46.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher plateau (avg ~113) from Period 39 to Period 45, following the recovery from the P16-P25 dip.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after recovering from the Period 16-25 dip. Since Period 39, the average demand is approximately 115 units (P39-P46 mean: 113.6). Although individual periods like P44 saw a dip to 84, others like P41, P42, P45, and P46 are consistently high (119-129). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize the sum of stockouts and holding costs. I will use the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this most recent stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current mean (~114) and sigma_hat accounts for the observed volatility in this window.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 39, with an average demand of approximately 115 units per period. The last ten periods (P38-P47) show a mean of 111.5. Despite high variability, the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean and variance of this current stable regime (P39-P47). The system is currently holding 13 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while accounting for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher plateau following its recovery from the Period 16-25 dip. Since Period 39, demand has consistently averaged around 110-115 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 32 units on hand and 0 in transit. To maintain sufficient stock levels for this established high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 (covering periods 39-48), which captures the current average of approximately 110 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which the base stock logic will naturally target. This strategy ensures we cover the current demand trend while avoiding excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P39-P48 stable with mean ~110 and standard deviation ~16.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from around Period 39. Over the last 11 periods (P39-P49), the mean demand is approximately 109 units (112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, 128, 119, 101, 81, 91). Although there is some fluctuation, the recent N approach with N=11 provides a reliable estimate for this current regime. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (\u03bc\u0302) to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs. Setting L to default (0) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the backend reflects the current stable but high-volatility environment.
