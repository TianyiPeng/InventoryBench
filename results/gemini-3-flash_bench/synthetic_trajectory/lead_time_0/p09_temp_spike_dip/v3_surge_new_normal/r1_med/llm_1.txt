  "rationale": "The simulation is at Period 50, which is the final period. In most inventory management simulations, the goal is to maximize total reward, which includes profit from sales and minus holding costs for ending inventory. Since Period 50 is the terminal period, any units ordered will arrive during the period (lead time 0) and be available to meet demand. However, any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur a holding cost without any possibility of being sold in future periods. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to order exactly enough to satisfy expected demand while avoiding excess ending inventory. Looking at the recent demand regime (P26-P49), the average demand has been approximately 125 units with a recent range between 108 and 147. Period 49 had a demand of 133. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I will order 130 units, which is close to the recent average and aligns with the demand levels seen in the last 20 periods, aimed at fulfilling demand while minimizing leftover stock penalties.",
