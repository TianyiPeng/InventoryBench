Starting with 0 on-hand inventory, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand immediately. I will target a slightly conservative amount near the average of the initial samples provided to minimize stockouts while managing the risk of the $1.0 holding cost, which equals the unit profit.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable post-spike regime since Period 39. Over the last 11 periods (P39-P49), demand has averaged approximately 118 units, with a range between 94 and 151. Recent demand (P47: 151, P48: 126, P49: 117) suggests the mean is slightly higher than the previous estimate of 113. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period. Since this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy the expected demand while minimizing leftover inventory, as any remaining stock at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs without the possibility of future sales. I will target the recent average demand of 120 units. Current on-hand is 28. To reach 120, I need to order 92 units. Ordering 92 units ensures I cover the expected demand while minimizing exposure to holding costs at game end.",
