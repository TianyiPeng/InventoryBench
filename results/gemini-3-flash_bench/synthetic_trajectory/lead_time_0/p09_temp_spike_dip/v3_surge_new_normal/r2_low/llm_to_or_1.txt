Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we are at Period 1 with no order history and only 5 data points for historical demand (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean demand is 115.4 and the standard deviation is 36.17. The promised lead time is 0. Since on-hand inventory is 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the parameters for the OR engine. The OR engine will calculate the base stock for a (L+1) period (1 period in this case since L=0) and place an order to satisfy the high profit relative to holding cost (though here profit/holding cost is 1:1, resulting in a 0.5 service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 116 units which arrived immediately (lead time 0). Demand was 140, leading to a stockout (116 sold, 0 remaining). The historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant variance. The most recent demand (Period 1 actual: 140) aligns closer to the higher end of the sample set. Since lead time is 0, the base stock formula simplified is mu + z*sigma. With $1 profit and $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning z* is 0. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) to capture the demand mean and standard deviation from the available sample periods, adjusting for the fact that Period 5's data point (59) appears to be an outlier or part of a different regime compared to the current observed demand (140). However, per the instructions to be conservative and follow the sequence, I will use recent_N=5 for demand to balance the samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Periods 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand (140, 136) has consistently exceeded the orders placed (116, 115), resulting in stockouts and lost profits. The historical demand data provided (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) shows high volatility. My objective is to increase the base stock to cover the high demand and avoid ending with zero inventory, especially since the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), suggesting a critical ratio (q) of 0.5 (z=0). However, the capped policy in the OR engine uses a 0.95 service level for the cap. Given the recent demand samples in the 'GAME HISTORY' (140, 136) are higher than the long-term mean of the provided seed data, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the most recent demand more heavily. For sigma, I will use 'default' to capture the broader volatility seen in the seed samples (range 59-150) to ensure the safety stock is sufficient.

Daily Profit: $92.00, Daily Holding Cost: $46.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have 46 units on-hand from the previous period (Period 3), where demand dropped significantly to 92 units compared to the starting periods (~140). The average demand over the first three periods is approximately 122 units. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), the critical ratio is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)), which means the base stock target should be the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility and the recent drop, balancing the initial high demand with the recent low. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current standard deviation of the demand arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 140, 136, 92, and 58. The provided demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show a notable drop in the most recent period (Period 5), consistent with the 'conclude' message for Period 4 (demand=58). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 65 units on hand. Given the significant downward trend in demand over the last two periods (92 followed by 58), using a full historical average would overestimate needs. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while maintaining enough stock for potential volatility. L remains default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 5 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arrived in the same period as ordered). The demand has shown significant variability (range: 58 to 140). Specifically, demand samples are: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118 (Mean: 108.8, Std Dev: 33.7). The previous system-calculated order in Period 5 (ordered 31) resulted in a stockout (sold 96, ending inventory 0), indicating the need for a higher base stock to cover demand volatility, especially since lead time is short but demand is swingy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for Mu and Sigma to capture the full history available which reflects the current variability, while keeping L as 'default' (0). Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50. The OR engine will set a base stock around the median demand, but the 'cap' mechanism usually provides some safety buffer. Given the stockout in Period 5, I want to ensure the mean estimate is robust.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 concluded periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant fluctuations: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, and 106. The mean demand is approximately 108 units per period. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which means the OR backend will aim for the median demand. Currently, we have 3 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since lead time is 0, the base stock only needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use the default lead time (0) and define mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods of historical demand to capture the most recent volatility without over-reacting to the low period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from periods 1-7 confirms a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Demand over the last 7 periods has been 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96, with a mean of ~106.6 and a standard deviation of ~27.7. There was a temporary dip in demand around periods 3-4, but it has stabilized back toward the ~100 range in periods 5-7. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is consistently 0. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent history while recovering from the low-demand dip. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to provide a balanced buffer. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock level (Inventory Position) to meet demand within the same period while accounting for the $1.0 holding cost vs $1.0 profit (targeting a ~50% service level due to equal costs).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, implying an target service level of 50%. This means we should aim for a base stock level near the median demand to minimize the total cost (stockout vs. holding). Based on 'Period X conclude' messages, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand from Period 1 to 8 shows a mean of 108.5 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) is 108.0 units (106, 96, 122). No sustained regime shifts or seasonal trends are yet evident since demand remains volatile but centered around the same mean. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (consistently 0) and the 'recent_N' method (N=8) for demand parameters to capture the full recent history while allowed for flexibility in future periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has averaged approximately 108.7 units per period. The inventory consistently hits zero (stockouts in periods 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9), suggesting that while the OR engine is ordering, the current parameters might be slightly underestimating demand or volatility. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. To improve service level and minimize lost sales (which currently occur frequently), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~110 range), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the same-period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 18 units with no in-transit stock. Historical data from periods 1-10 shows demand ranging from 58 to 140, with an average around 107. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) suggest a 50% service level target (critical ratio = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which mathematically directs the base-stock level toward the mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent market behavior (Periods 6-10 avg demand \u2248 105.6), while keeping L at default (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since Period 6. From Period 1 to Period 5, demand was volatile (ranging from 58 to 140, mean ~108.8, std ~32.4). From Period 6 to Period 11, demand has been much more consistent (ranging from 93 to 122, mean ~105.0, std ~11.1). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$1, Holding=$1), the target service level (q) is 50%, meaning the OR engine will target the mean demand. Since there's a clear reduction in volatility, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the more stable demand regime and prevent over-ordering due to the higher variance seen in early periods. This will result in a lower sigma_hat and more efficient inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: demand variance decreased from ~32.4 to ~11.1; mean demand remains stable around 105 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. A lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in all concluded periods (P1-P12). The carry-over insight from period 12 notes a demand regime shift at Period 6, where mean demand stabilized around 105 units with significantly reduced variance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to focus on this stable regime (Periods 6-12). This captures the lower volatility (std \u2248 15.6) and average demand (mean \u2248 101.5 in the last 7 periods) compared to the initial noisy period (P1-P5). With Profit ($1.0) and Holding ($1.0) being equal, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock (mu_hat) should target the median demand for lead time + review period. Using recent_N helps the OR backend compute a more accurate mean and standard deviation for this current regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the current on-hand inventory is 46 units with 0 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 1 to 13 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand since Period 6 has shown a mean and standard deviation shift compared to the initial periods. Over the last 8 periods (Period 6-13), demand samples are [106, 96, 122, 111, 93, 102, 73, 55]. However, the most recent two periods (73, 55) show a significant drop from the previous average of ~105. To avoid overstocking due to this potential downward trend while still respecting the longer-term regime identified in the carry-over insights, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Setting N=8 for mu_hat captures the regime since Period 6, but to be more sensitive to the recent volatility and potential downward shift in demand, I will use recent_8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current environment. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand was 98 units, and we ended with 0 inventory. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The historical demand starting from Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units (98, 55, 73, 102, 93, 111, 122, 96, 106). However, the last few periods (P12-P14) have shown lower demand (73, 55, 98), slightly pulling down the recent average. Since the promised lead time is 0, the base stock formula simplified for q=0.5 (where profit=holding cost) targets the median demand to cover the current period. To avoid stockouts seen in P14 while respecting the stable demand regime from P6 onwards, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the regime from P6 to P14) to capture the current mean more accurately than the global mean, which is skewed by higher initial demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 6 through Period 15 indicates a relatively stable mean with a slight downward trend in the last few periods (Period 12-15). Specifically, the demand sequence is: 106, 96, 122, 111, 93, 102, 73, 55, 98, 77. The average for the last 10 periods (since the regime shift identified in Period 12) is 93.3 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every arrival in the history. To handle the increased volatility seen in recent samples while maintaining responsiveness to the stabilized mean, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime while filtering out the noisier early data (Periods 1-5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 305 units, far exceeding the recent stable mean of ~105 units. This suggests a potential structural shift or a localized demand peak. The current inventory (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 0) is insufficient to meet any sustained increase. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use an explicit value based on this recent spike, while acknowledging that a single period of 305 might overstate future demand if it was an outlier. However, since the cost of stockouts (Lost Profit + Demand) is high, I will set mu_hat (for 1+L periods, where L=0) to 250 to buffer against a sustained high-demand regime, while using recent_N for sigma to capture the increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand spiked to 305 units, deviating significantly from the prior mean of ~105.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 305 units, and Period 17 confirmed this new high-demand regime with 322 units. This is a sharp departure from the previous average of ~105 units observed between Periods 6-15. Effectively, demand has tripled. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this sudden shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 data points (Period 16 and 17) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current peak demand levels and prevents further stockouts. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that covers the expected 300+ units of demand for Period 18.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged ~313 units, compared to the prior mean of ~105 (+200% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods was 305, 322, and 219 (average 282). Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~105. Period 18 saw a relative drop to 219, but this remains significantly above the old mean. With on-hand inventory at 95 and a lead time of 0 (consistent throughout history), we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean of this high-demand segment (Period 16-18) while discounting the older low-demand history. Lead time L remains at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 16-19), demand underwent a massive spike: 305, 322, 219, and 194 units respectively. While the initial spike was over 300, the last two periods suggest a stabilization or slight cooling around the 200-unit mark. The mean demand for these 4 periods is approximately 260. Given the high volatility in this new regime (fluctuating between 194 and 322) and the Profit/Holding cost ratio of 1.0 (50% service level target), I will focus on the most recent 4-period window to capture this high-demand state while acknowledging the downward trend toward ~200. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 16-19) average demand is ~260, characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~64). Demand appears to be cooling slightly from a peak >300 to ~200.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-demand regime that started in Period 16. However, demand has cooled from its initial spike (>300) to a more stable yet volatile range between 194 and 235 over the last three periods. The mean demand for the high-demand regime (Periods 16-20) is approximately 255. Applying the 'recent_N' method with N=5 captures this specific regime shift while accounting for the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 57) observed during this window. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical concludes. With profit and holding costs equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, essentially ordering to the mean plus a buffer for volatility. Given the 'On-hand' inventory is only 25 units and demand is averaging ~255, we need to maintain high targets to avoid stockouts while acknowledging the slight cooling trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 (avg ~235 units/period) is continuing, although demand has stabilized lower than the initial peak of >300 seen in Periods 16-17. The last four periods (Periods 18-21) show demand of 219, 194, 235, and 195, averaging approximately 211 units with a standard deviation of 20. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the critical ratio q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) is 0.5 (1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0)), the OR backend will set the base stock at the median of the demand distribution (z* = 0). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the high-demand regime while excluding the extreme initial spike of Period 16-17 to avoid over-ordering as the pattern cools. This covers (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 210 units (Periods 18-21) following the initial hyper-peak (Periods 16-17). Variance has decreased relative to the start of the spike.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the demand was 252 units, which is higher than the previous stabilization estimate of ~210 units but still lower than the initial spike (>300). Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has been 219, 194, 235, 195, and 252, averaging 219. This suggests a relatively stable 'high demand' regime following the initial surge in P16-17. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, necessitating a full order to meet demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand level (approx 219 units) and its associated volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in high-demand regime, averaging 219 units over Periods 18-22 (P16-17 hyper-peak excluded).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 18, following a hyper-peak in Periods 16-17. In the most recent six periods (P18-P23), demand has averaged 217.67 units (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211) with a standard deviation of approximately 23.5. We are currently at Period 24 with on-hand inventory of only 8 units and no items in transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows orders arriving within the same period (total lead time = 0). Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand. I will use the last 6 periods (the stable high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we cover this new mean while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the high-demand regime that began at Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 18-24), demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 221 units (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237). Although the system ended Period 24 with 0 on-hand inventory due to demand (237) slightly exceeding the total available (218), the supply chain remains responsive with a lead time of 0 periods. To capture this stabilized 'high' regime and filter out the initial hyper-peak of Periods 16-17, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the baseline reflects the current ~220 unit average and recent volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 220 units (Periods 18-24) with consistent 0-day lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift starting around Period 16. While the initial spike (Periods 16-17) exceeded 300 units, the demand subsequently stabilized into a high-demand regime. Over the most recent 8 periods (Periods 18-25), the average demand is approximately 230 units (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237, 294), with a notable uptick to 294 in Period 25. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To account for the stabilized high demand and the recent upward trend, I am using a recent_N approach with N=8. This captures the current regime's mean (~230) and variance while excluding the initial hyper-spike from Period 16-17. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand profile without over-reacting to the historical low-demand period (P1-P15).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Period 18-25 average demand is 230 units (approx. +120% vs original baseline), with Period 25 showing a renewed spike to 294.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped significantly to 113 units, contrasting with the high-demand regime of ~230 units observed between Periods 18-25. This sharp decline could be a one-time outlier or the start of a cooling-down phase following the extended peak period. Given the on-hand inventory of 117 units, which is already sufficient to cover this lower demand level, I am cautious about over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the average demand from the current high regime (starts Period 18) while incorporating this latest drop (P26). This balances the risk of a sustained lower mean vs. the potential for a rebound to the ~230 level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a more volatile phase following the high-demand regime that began in Period 16. After peaking over 300, demand stabilized around 220-230, but the last two periods (P26-27) show a sharp drop to 113 and 145 respectively. This suggests either a return to the original baseline (~105) or a new intermediate regime. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR engine targets a 50% service level (z=0), meaning we aim to stock the mean demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this recent downward shift while maintaining some protection against another spike, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the lower trajectory of the last two periods (113, 145) and the spike before them (294), resulting in a mean of approximately 184 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility seen in these fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: demand dropped from a stable ~225 to an average of 129 over the last two periods (P26-27), indicating a cooling of the previous high-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant shift away from the high-demand regime (which averaged ~230 units) back towards a lower level. Period 26 demand was 113, Period 27 was 145, and Period 28 was 184. While Period 28 shows a slight uptick, the average over these last three periods is approximately 147 units, significantly lower than the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this cooling demand while remaining responsive to the slight upward trend in Period 28, I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~147. This avoids over-ordering based on the older ~230 average while providing enough stock to meet demand levels similar to Period 28. Sigma_hat is set to the same N=3 window to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: demand dropped from ~230 to an average of 147 over Periods 26-28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context has shifted from a high-demand regime (Periods 16-25, avg ~235) to a lower, cooling regime starting around Period 26. Demand for the last four periods (P26-29) was 113, 145, 184, and 133, averaging 143.75 units. This is significantly lower than the previous ~230 average but higher than the original baseline of ~105. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new cooling demand regime. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period 29 conclude' message showing same-period arrival. Given Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1), the service level target is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver for the order. Setting N=4 for sigma_hat as well to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: four-period average (P26-29) is 143.75 units, a clear reduction from the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 26. The average demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 131 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80). The most recent observation (Period 30) shows demand dipping to 80, which suggests either continued volatility or a potentially even lower baseline. Given the high-demand period (P16-P25) averaged around 230 units, this is a significant sustained reduction. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime (approx 131 units per period). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 5 to reflect the current volatility within this new regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages (every order from P1 to P30 arrived in 0 periods), so L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed and sustained: 5-period average (P26-P30) is 131 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units. Period 30 demand (80) is the lowest since the start of the high-demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear regime shift starting at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 26-31), the demand values are 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, and 81. The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 122.7 units, which is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units. The last two periods (30 and 31) specifically show very low demand (80 and 81), suggesting the 'cooling' noted in earlier insights is continuing or settling at a new, lower baseline. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the mean and variance of this current lower-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, ensuring we can respond quickly to these shifts. The on-hand inventory is 50, and since L=0, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock for the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: 6-period average (P26-P31) is 122.7 units, showing a sustained cooling from the previous ~230 unit average. Demand in the last two periods (P30-P31) stabilized near 80 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. Since then, the demand has been much lower compared to the previous high-demand period (~230 units). Specifically, looking at the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is 123 units, but the last three periods (P30, P31, P32) show even lower values (80, 81, 126), averaging 95.6 units. Given the shift confirmed in Period 32, I will use a window of last 7 samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained cooling while providing some buffer for the recent uptick in P32. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime stabilization post-cooling: 7-period average (P26-P32) is 123 units, suggesting a return toward the original baseline (~105) but with higher intermittency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a post-peak regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand samples are: 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126, 133. The latest 8-period average is approximately 124.4 units, which is much lower than the previous high-demand regime (~230) and closer to the original baseline (~105). Period 33 demand was 133, slightly above this new average. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this stabilized cooling regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same N=8 period to account for the current volatility (std dev \u2248 34.6). This approach balances the risk of stockouts at low on-hand inventory while avoiding excessive holding costs as the market cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization post-cooling: 8-period average (P26-P33) is 124 units, indicating a return to a lower-demand state relative to the P18-P25 peak.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 26. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 127 units, a significant reduction from the high-demand peak (Periods 18-25, ~230 units). Recent demand (P32-P34) has ticked up slightly with values of 126, 133, and 146, suggesting the current mean is closer to 130-140 than the extreme low of 80 seen in P30-P31. With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently being 0, the strategy is to move the forecast window to capture this established lower-demand state. Using N=9 for mu_hat (P26-P34) focuses on this entire post-peak cooling period, resulting in a mean of ~127. sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-cooling: 9-period average (P26-P34) is 127 units, with recent upward trend (P32-P34 avg: 135).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a post-peak regime since Period 26. The 10-period average (P26-P35) is 127.2 units, significantly lower than the P18-P25 average (~230) but slightly higher than the original baseline (~105). Recent demand (last 4 periods: 126, 133, 146, 111) shows an average of 129 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N to capture this stabilized 'new normal' regime, setting N=10 to cover the data since the drop in Period 26, which balances the recent slight upward tick with the lower observations from Periods 30-31.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P35) average is 127 units, reflecting a stable state significantly lower than the P18-P25 peak but ~20% higher than the initial P6-P15 baseline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a stable regime following the significant spike between Periods 16-25. Since the localized regime shift starting at Period 26, the demand has been lower but shows slight volatility. The 11-period average desde Period 26 is approximately 125 units. The most recent demand (Period 36) was 127 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand (127) slightly exceeding starting inventory (126). Since actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 11 to capture the entirety of the post-peak demand regime (Periods 26-36) which provides a more accurate representation than the long-term or peak-period history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-peak regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 37, the mean is approximately 122 units per period. The most recent three periods (P35-P37) show demands of 111, 127, and 85, averaging 107.7. However, the broader stabilization since the cooling from the hyper-peak justifies using a slightly larger window to capture variance. Lead time consistently remains 0. I will use recent_N with N=12 to cover the entire 'post-cooling' period (P26-P37) as it represents a coherent demand regime distinct from the previous spike, providing a stable estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat while accounting for recent fluctuations.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the post-peak stabilization regime that began around Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 34-38), demand has been 146, 111, 127, 85, and 131, resulting in a 5-period average of 120 units. This is consistent with the sustained cooling observed since the Period 18-25 high-demand peak, settling slightly above the original Period 6-15 baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages for every period in history. Given the inventory is currently at 0 and the demand is relatively stable but volatile (Standard Deviation of ~25 over the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering the stabilization regime from P26-P38) to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this modern average rather than the historical hyper-peak or the ancient baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization regime (P26-P38) average demand is 121.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 28 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a post-peak regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the data from Period 26 to Period 39 (14 data points), the average demand is approximately 121.36 units with a standard deviation of 28.5. This period overlaps with the previously identified 'post-peak stabilization regime'. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 111, 127, 85, 131, 115) averages 113.8. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median/mean demand to minimize total costs. I will use the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we account for the observed volatility while tracking the lower mean relative to the P18-P25 peak.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-peak regime starting around Period 26. Since Period 35, the demand has been relatively consistent: P35(111), P36(127), P37(85), P38(131), P39(115), P40(110). The average for this most recent sub-segment (P35-P40) is ~113.2 units, with a standard deviation of ~16.5. This is lower than the broader P26-P38 average of 121.5 but confirms the return toward the original baseline (~105) while maintaining some elevation. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while keeping safety stock at a level that handles the observed variance, ensuring we don't stock out as we did in Period 38.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization (P35-P40) indicates a tighter demand range around 113 units with reduced volatility (Std Dev ~16.5) compared to the earlier P26-P34 period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-peak regime since Period 26. As recorded in the carry-over insights for Period 41, the recent demand (P35-P41) has averaged approximately 111.4 units with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P26-P34 window. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently at 15 units on-hand with no units in transit. Given the stability of the current regime, I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent stabilized performance (P35-P41), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the current low-volatility environment.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a stable post-peak regime starting around Period 35. Over the most recent 8 periods (P35-P42), average demand is approximately 115 units with a standard deviation of about 19 units. In the most recent period (P42), demand was 143, which is the high end of this range but consistent with the underlying volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while filtering out the high-demand volatility from previous periods (P16-P25). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand (mu_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'post-peak' regime that began around Period 26, though with some internal shifts. In the most recent period (P43), demand was 94 units, relative to an average of approximately 113-115 units since Period 35. Over the last 9 periods (P35-P43), the average demand is 112.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. This represents a return toward the original baseline (~105) but remains slightly elevated. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current stabilized yet slightly volatile behavior, I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P35-P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-stabilization regime. Lead time L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization (P35-P43) confirms a demand mean of ~113 units with a standard deviation of ~18.5 units. This extends the previous Period 41 insight with additional evidence of stability.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable in a post-peak stabilization regime since Period 35. The mean demand from Period 35 to Period 44 is approximately 113.6 units with a standard deviation of 18.2. Period 44 saw a demand of 118, which is consistent with this regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history of the game. Ending inventory for Period 44 was 0, meaning we have no on-hand stock and no units in-transit for Period 45. To satisfy demand for Period 45, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P35-P44). Method 'calculate' for L will confirm the observed 0-period lead time.

On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we must order to cover the demand for the upcoming period. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a post-peak stabilization regime that began around Period 35. Over the last 12 periods (P35-P46), the average demand is approximately 114 units with a standard deviation of 18 units. The most recent demand at Period 46 was 106 units, and looking at the window from Period 41 to 46, the average is 115 units. Given the stability of this regime, I will use a window of N=12 for demand forecasting to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the noise from the prior high-demand peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent stable period, the OR backend will maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand and a reasonable safety buffer without excessive holding costs.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'post-peak stabilization' regime that began around Period 35. Over the last 13 periods (P35-P47), the mean demand is approximately 117 units. Recent demand has shown a slight uptick (P47 demand was 151), but it remains consistent with the established range (approx. 85-151). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in the history. I will continue using a window of N=13 (P35-P47) to capture this stable regime's mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while buffering against the observed volatility (Std Dev ~19.5).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization (P35-P47) confirms a sustained demand mean of ~117 units with a standard deviation of ~19.5 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable post-peak regime since approximately Period 35. Over the last 14 periods (P35-P48), the mean demand is 117.2 units with a standard deviation of 18.5. The most recent sequence (P42-P48) has shown a slight uptick in mean demand to 124 units. Given this consistency, I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current stable regime's statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 48 conclude'. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, requiring the base stock to track the mean closely to avoid excess holding costs while preventing stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable post-peak regime since approximately Period 35. Over the last 15 periods (P35-P49), the mean demand is 115.3 units with a standard deviation of 18.4. Recent performance (last 5 periods, P45-P49) shows a slightly higher mean of 126.0 units due to higher peaks in P47 and P48, but effectively aligned with the established stable range of ~117 units noted in the Carry-over Insights at Period 48. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory is nearly 0 (1 unit), the OR parameters must accurately capture this stable demand to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit). I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime's statistics accurately while allowing for the moderate volatility observed.
