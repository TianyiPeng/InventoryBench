The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Historical demand data shows a range between 59 and 150 units, with an average of approximately 115 units over the five provided samples. Specifically, the first historical sample (Period_1) was 146. Since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00), I aim to cover the immediate demand without excessive overstocking. I will order 150 units to safely cover a high-end demand estimate for the first period, accounting for the fact that demand resolution happens after my order arrives (if lead time is indeed 0).",
