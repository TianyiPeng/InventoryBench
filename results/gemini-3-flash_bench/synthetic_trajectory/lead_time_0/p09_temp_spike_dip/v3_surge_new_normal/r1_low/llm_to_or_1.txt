Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) shows a mean of 115.4 and significant variance (std deviation ~35). The most recent period (Period 5) saw a sharp drop to 59, which might be a change in regime or just noise; however, with a 5-period sample, 'default' settings cover the full available history. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet Period 1 demand. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full historical sample set for calculating the base stock level (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all 5 provided data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 88 units. The promised lead time of 0 was confirmed as the order placed in Period 1 arrived within the same period. The historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant variability with an average of approximately 115. However, the last sample (59) and the actual demand in Period 1 (88) suggest a potential downward shift or high volatility. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level target is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reinforce the 0-period observation and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most relevant recent volatility while maintaining enough samples to estimate variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 25. Looking at the history, the actual lead time for Periods 1 and 2 was 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows: P1=146, P2=110, P3=112, P4=150, P5=59 (note: the 'historical demand data' section provided separate samples from the game history logs, I will prioritize logs for recent behavior and historical samples for baseline). In the game history logs: P1 demand was 88 and P2 demand was 79. This is lower than the historical sample mean (115.4). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z*=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the recent slightly lower demand observed in the logs (avg ~84), which helps prevent overstocking since holding costs are high relative to profit. I'll maintain L=0 as 'default' since it's consistent so far.

=== Period 3 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $84.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand spiked to 121 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 84, ending inventory 0). The demand history so far is 88, 79, and 121. The mean demand is 96, but the recent jump to 121 suggests a potential shift or higher volatility. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will maintain L=0. To recover from the stockout and account for the higher recent demand, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased mean and variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a higher base stock to meet current demand levels while considering the risk of further spikes.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, the demand was 103, but because we only had 96 units on hand (from the Period 4 order), we sold out and ended with 0 inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods is holding true (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand over the first 4 periods has been 88, 79, 121, and 103, showing an upward trend and higher volatility than initially expected. The mean demand is approximately 98 units with a standard deviation around 18. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. However, to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 3 and 4, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand level while providing a slight buffer via sigma_hat calculation. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-5 confirms that all orders arrived in the same period they were placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been consistently exceeding supply over the last three periods (P3-P5), resulting in zero ending inventory and lost sales. The historical demand samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) differ significantly from the 'conclude' messages (88, 79, 121, 103, 111). I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages as they reflect the actual realization in the simulation. The mean demand of the last 5 periods from conclude messages is approximately 100.4. Since demand is relatively stable but has lead to stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this level. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the volatility (Std Dev \u2248 17). Lead time L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable yet high demand pattern (P1-P6 demand: 88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130), with an average of approximately 105 units and a significant increase observed in the last four periods (average 116). However, the system has consistently under-ordered or faced stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P3, P4, P5, P6), leading to lost sales. The promised lead time is 0, which has been confirmed by arrival data in all 6 concluded periods. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock should roughly equal the mean demand. Given the recent higher demand readings, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current trend (average ~116) and a standard deviation calculated from those same 4 samples to protect against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time is 0 periods based on all 6 concluded periods. Consistent stockouts since Period 3 indicate the OR backend's default parameters were insufficient for the demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase in recent periods compared to the initial historical profile. In the last 5 periods (P3-P7), demand has averaged approximately 115.2 units (121, 103, 111, 130, 111), contrasting with an earlier average. Although the historical demand seed ranges from 59 to 150, current operational results show frequent stockouts when the system uses default parameters. Periodic concluding data confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit, I am setting L to 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime (average ~115). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=5 to capture recent volatility. Given Profit=HoldingCost=$1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), but because we have 0 lead time and have been hitting zero inventory too often, ensuring mu captures the recent mean is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: average demand increased to ~115 units per period. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 3. Looking at the demand from Period 3 through Period 8 (121, 103, 111, 130, 111, 101), the mean is approximately 112.8 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Despite this, there were significant stockouts from Period 3 to Period 6 because the inventory levels (on-hand + order) were insufficient to meet demand surges. The current on-hand inventory is 15. The OR backend needs to set a base stock that covers the imminent demand of Period 9. With Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) being equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand). To ensure we don't stock out given the recent variability (std dev ~10.5), I will use the last 6 periods (the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect the current demand level of ~113 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a significant demand drop to 56 units in Period 9, compared to the mean of ~115 units observed between Periods 3-8. This follows a streak of stockouts that ended in Period 7. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The Profit ($1.0) to Holding Cost ($1.0) ratio implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)), meaning the OR engine will aim to stock the median demand. However, historical samples provided in the prompt (before game history) showed high volatility (up to 150), and Periods 3-8 averaged ~113. Period 9's drop to 56 is an outlier or a potential new regime shift downward. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime from Period 3 onwards while incorporating the recent drop. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for a single period (1+0). I will set L=0 explicitly to ensure the system doesn't revert to any hidden default longer than the observed 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 9 demand (56) dropped significantly below the Period 3-8 average (~113). Monitoring for a downward regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand spiked significantly to 156 units, which is a record high for the series, following a sharp dip in Period 9 (56). This extreme volatility confirms my prior insight regarding high variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the spike exceeding the safety stock. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (order placed in P10 arrived in P10). Because demand is swinging wildly (low of 56, high of 156 in the last two periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (P3-P10) to capture the higher mean of the current regime (~111), but I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 35 to capture the recent volatility seen in the P9-P10 swing, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to buffer against these 50-100 unit fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in Period 10, with a range of 56 to 156 over the last two periods (~178% increase), confirming that the current demand regime is highly unstable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be highly volatile with a current mean of approximately 106 units over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), with a standard deviation around 26. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. In Period 10, a stockout occurred because demand spiked to 156, exceeding the starting inventory of 105. Period 11 saw a stabilization (demand 109), but on-hand inventory is now only 3. To prevent future stockouts in this high-volatility environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (the detected 'high volatility' regime starting at P3). This helps the OR backend establish a more robust base stock level (target inventory) that accounts for the frequent demand spikes observed since Period 3 while respecting the 0-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units since the low point in Period 9 (P10: 156, P11: 109, P12: 103). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. The previous volatility (range 56-156) warrants a wider sigma but the recent mean is fairly consistent. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the behavior post-Period 9 dip, including the high-demand Period 10 and the more moderate P11-P12. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to incorporate the high variance from P10 into the safety stock while filtering out the very low P9 value. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level q is 0.5; however, given the stockout history, I want the base stock to robustly cover the current mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Period 9 dip has stabilized around a mean of ~122 (P10-P12 avg), though P10 was a significant outlier (156).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand was 92 units, which is slightly below the recent mean but within the expected variance for this SKU. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Looking at the demand history post-Period 9 (which was a significant low outlier), the values have been 156, 109, 103, and 92. This averages to approximately 115 units per period. The standard deviation in this recent window is relatively high due to the Period 10 spike. To maintain service levels while accounting for this volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the stability post-spike, and an 'explicit' sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine doesn't undershoot demand during spikes. A sigma of 30 covers the range observed in 75% of the post-dip periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be stable following a period of high volatility. Since Period 11, demand has been 109, 103, 92, and 97, yielding a four-period mean of 100.25. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by all visible history. Using a shorter lookback (N=4) for mu_hat better reflects this current stabilized demand level compared to the longer-term average (which is skewed by earlier stockouts and the Period 10 outlier of 156). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture the current reduced volatility (std \u2248 7.3) while maintain a safety buffer. Setting L=0 ensures the OR engine focuses on covering the immediate period's demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level, making precise mean estimation critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~100 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) compared to the P3-P10 era (~113).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand surged to 128 units, exceeding the available on-hand inventory and resulting in a stockout. This highlights that demand remains volatile despite the lower average observed in periods 11-14. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during such spikes while considering the high holding cost (profit:holding is 1:1), I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 6 (Periods 10-15), which averages ~114 units, capturing both the recent lower mean and the periodic high spikes (156 and 128). sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 6 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility persists: Period 15 showed a spike to 128 units after a 4-period period of relative stability, indicating the need for higher safety stock even when mean demand appears to drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand spiked massive to 263 units, which is significantly higher than any previous sample. This appears to be a major demand shock or a new regime. The current historical average of ~113-115 is now severely underestimating potential demand. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has been 103, 92, 97, 128, 263 (mean: 136.6). However, the spike to 263 is an extreme outlier (over 2x the recent mean). I will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to prevent catastrophic stockouts, using an explicit mu_hat reflecting a weighted anticipation of high demand (forecasting ~150 to bridge the gap between the previous stable regime and the current spike) and explicit sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen in P16. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike observed in Period 16 (263 units), more than doubling the previous average. This signals a potential high-demand event or new regime requiring immediate safety stock adjustments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 concluded with a second massive demand spike (223 units), following the Period 16 spike (263 units). These two periods redefine the demand profile significantly compared to the previous average of ~100-110 units. We are likely in a high-demand seasonal peak or a new regime. The inventory stockouts in both Period 16 and 17 resulted from parameters that did not anticipate this extreme level of demand. To capture this new regime and prevent further stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the periods where the shift occurred (P15-P17: 128, 263, 223). Since L=0, the backend will calculate base_stock as (1+0)*mu_hat + z*sqrt(1+0)*sigma_hat. By isolating the last 3 periods, the mean demand per period (mu_hat) will be approximately 204.6. This aggressive adjustment is necessary to match the current demand velocity. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16 (263) and Period 17 (223) show a massive increase in demand (~200%+ compared to previous baseline). Average demand for the last 3 periods is ~205.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a dramatic regime shift starting at Period 16. The last three periods of demand are 263 (P16), 223 (P17), and 245 (P18), resulting in an average of approximately 243.6 units per period. This is a ~120% increase over the previous stable baseline of ~110. The system has stocked out for three consecutive periods because the base stock calculation, which heavily weights historical data, is too low. With Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit during this high-demand surge, I am applying 'recent_N' with N=3 to mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-volume regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, but 'calculate' is used to ensure the backend uses the latest empirical data.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: average demand jumped from ~110 to ~244 (+122%). Significant stockouts occurring due to rapid regime change.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 263, 223, 245, and 218, which creates a mean of 237.25 units. This is a massive shift from the previous average of ~110. Although Period 19 showed a slight decrease to 218, it remains very high. Stockouts were severe between Period 16 and 18, and only resolved in Period 19 because the OR backend's order finally caught up to the higher mean. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to ensure the OR engine targets this new regime's mean and captures the high volatility from the initial spike. This should maintain a high service level while the SKU is in this high-velocity phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand was 247, which exceeded the inventory of 238, continuing the trend of high demand that began in Period 16. The high-demand regime is firmly established, with demand values of 263, 223, 245, 218, and 247 over the last 5 periods. This results in a 5-period average of approximately 239.2. To capture this regime shift and minimize stockouts (which have occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. I am also using recent_N with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new level. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method for L.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16 onwards) remains stable at ~240 units/period (P16-P20 avg: 239.2). Consistent stockouts indicate demand is often exceeding the capped order policy's initial estimates for this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is not only sustained but shows signs of further escalation or extreme volatility. Period 21 saw a demand of 324 units, which is a new peak (previously 263). The mean demand from Period 16 to 21 is approximately 253 units. Despite ordering quantities around 240, we have stocked out in 5 of the last 6 periods, indicating that we are underestimating the upper bound of this regime and the 'cap' logic in the OR backend may be restricting necessary inventory. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this high-demand era (approx. 253 per period), and L will remain 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to increase safety stock, as demand has range from 218 to 324 in this period (std dev ~38), but given the stockout history, I want the OR backend to be more aggressive in its base stock calculation to prevent constant sold-out states.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P21) avg increased to ~253 units. Significant volatility peak in P21 (324 units) indicates ongoing risk of stockouts if using only previous regime means.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 persists. The demand for Period 22 was 239 units, following a peak of 324 in Period 21. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 251 units (P16-P22). However, looking at the last 5 periods (P18-P22), the average is higher at ~254.6 units. Given the persistent risk of stockouts (observed in P16, P17, P18, P20, P21), I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (the start of this regime) to capture the trend, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (e.g., the 324 unit spike in P21). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, which is too low given the high penalty of stockouts (lost profit). By providing a robust mu_hat and a high sigma_hat, I push the backend's base stock calculation higher to provide a better buffer against the observed volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) average is ~251 units, with significant volatility (high of 324, low of 218). The regime has stabilized at this elevated level for 7 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. In the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged 248.6 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline. While the recent average is stable, there is considerable volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 34.6), including a peak of 324 units in Period 21. Period 23 saw demand of 248 units, which is almost exactly at the regime average. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since the on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) and we are in a high-demand regime with $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the base stock formula, though the capped policy behaves more conservatively), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand periods. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent sustained pattern (Period 16 onwards).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) average confirmed at ~249 units/period, with high volatility (range 218-324). Mean remains +125% higher than the P1-P15 baseline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the period from P16 to P24, the average demand is 250.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units (excluding the P16-P17 transition spikes). The most recent demand (P24) was 244, closely aligning with this regime's average. Stockouts have been frequent when the order cap was too low, so I will continue using recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture the current mean and volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 24 demand (244) and the regime average (~250) are stable, N=9 is appropriate to provide the OR backend with the relevant local statistics to prevent under-ordering while accounting for the high volatility (range 218-324) observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the initial baseline. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 25 is approximately 251.4 units. In the most recent period (Period 25), demand was 263 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms that we are still in the high-demand regime and current stock levels are barely sufficient. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we satisfy this elevated demand and avoid stockouts, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 10 periods (N=10), which corresponds exactly to the start of this high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards). sigma_hat will also be calculated using this 10-period window to capture the volatility of this specific regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a major shift. After a sustained high-demand regime (P16-P25) where average demand was ~251 units, Period 26 observed a significant drop to 119 units. This drop follows a period of heavy sales and could indicate either an outlier or a downward regime shift. Given the product is 'Regular chips', demand is usually stable but subject to spikes. I will set the OR parameters to be responsive to this potential decrease while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the previous high regime's volatility if it returns. I'm using recent_N=11 for mu_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime plus the current drop (P16-P26), which averages ~239. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'explicit' at 50 to ensure the OR backend provides a sufficient buffer against the high variance seen recently (range 119-324). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand dropped to 119 units after a 10-period high-demand regime averaging ~251 units. Monitoring if this reverts to the old ~110 baseline or stays at a new intermediate level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the discovery in Period 27, Period 28 confirms a significant demand regime shift. Demand in Period 26 was 119 and Period 27 was 135. This is a sharp departure from the previous 10-period high-demand regime (Periods 16-25) which averaged ~249. It appears demand has returned to a level closer to the Period 1-15 baseline (~110-120). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures Period 26, 27, and the first sample of the drop Period 25 which was high) is a transition, but given the 100+ ending inventory, I will explicitly target a lower mean of 130 to prevent excess holding costs while demand settles. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of this shift without being over-penalized by the extreme highs of the previous regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed downward demand regime shift starting Period 26: Demand dropped from a ~250 average (P16-P25) to ~127 average (P26-P27), signaling the end of the high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is now firmly established. After a 10-period 'high demand' phase (averaging ~250 units), the last three periods (P26, P27, P28) have recorded demands of 119, 135, and 110 respectively. The average of this new regime is ~121.3 units, which is significantly lower than the previous phase but slightly higher than the original baseline of ~110. For Period 29, I am setting N=3 for the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this downward shift immediately and avoid excessive holding costs from over-ordering based on the previous high-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by 28 consecutive periods of zero-day arrivals. The on-hand inventory is currently 20 units; using recent_N for the OR backend will calculate a base stock suited to the ~121 average, resulting in an order that covers the gap.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Demand average dropped from ~250 (P16-P25) to ~121 (P26-P28), a decrease of approximately 52%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 26 is now firmly established. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 123.0 units (119, 135, 110, 128), which is a significant drop from the previous 10-period average of ~250. Period 29 ended with 0 on-hand inventory because the order placed in Period 28 (25 units) was too small, reflecting the OR backend's adjustment to the high ending inventory from Period 27. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new, lower-demand regime (P26 to P29). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock relevant to the current ~123 unit demand level while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: 4-period average (P26-P29) is 123.0 units, down from ~250 units in the P16-P25 period (-51%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new lower regime after the high-demand peak (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the demand samples are 119, 135, 110, 128, and 144. This yields a 5-period average of 127.2 units per period, which is a significant drop from the previous ~250 average but higher than the pre-spike baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent upward trend in the last few periods (110 -> 128 -> 144), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent regime shift (P26) while capturing the current volatility to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the lower regime that started in Period 26. The 6-period average (P26-P31) is approximately 119.2 units, which is a significant drop from the ~250 average seen during the P16-P25 interval. Recent demand was 79 (P31), following 144 (P30), showing a downward movement or at least high volatility around the new mean. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to specifically capture the mean of this current regime (P26-P31). Given the high volatility observed in P30 (144) versus P31 (79), I am using sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to ensure the safety stock is appropriately sized for this regime's variance without being influenced by the outdated high-demand period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the downward regime that started at Period 26. Since Period 26, demand observations have been: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, and 126. The average demand for this latest 7-period regime (P26-P32) is approximately 120.1 units per period. The recent drop in Period 31 (79) followed by a rebound in Period 32 (126) demonstrates ongoing volatility despite the lower mean. Stockout occurred in Period 32 because the order was based on a low previous period (Period 31 demand was 79). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N = 7 to encapsulate exactly this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from Period 26 to Period 32 confirmed: average demand is 120.1 units (range 79-144).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new regime since Period 26. Analyzing demand from Period 26 to Period 33 (8 samples), the average is 118.0 units (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103). This represents a significant and sustained drop (approx -53%) from the high-demand period observed between Periods 16-25 (avg ~250). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adjust for this stable regime while accounting for moderate volatility (std dev approx 19.8), I will set N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N=8 ensures the OR backend uses the current regime statistics (starting Period 26) to determine the base stock, preventing over-ordering based on the historical Period 16-25 peak.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stabilized regime starting from Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has averaged 115.8 units with a range between 79 and 144. The most recent three periods (P32-P34) show values of 126, 103, and 98, suggesting the mean is stable or slightly softening. Since Period 26, lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture this specific post-peak regime and sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the moderate volatility observed within this period (std dev approx 19). The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a stable regime that began around Period 26, following a massive high-demand spike (Periods 16-25). Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 118.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. Period 35 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout (demand 131 vs on-hand 116), confirming that the current logic is leaning too lean given the volatility. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current stable regime while excluding the previous high-demand outlier period. This will balance the inventory to meet the ~120 unit mean while providing enough buffer for spikes up to ~140-150 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime Period 26-35: average demand is 118.3 units (range 79-144, std ~19.3). Lead time remains 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a stable regime following the significant drop at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 118.4 units per period (sum = 1302 / 11 periods), with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current period starts with 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is 0, the order must cover the immediate demand of Period 37. I will use the recent_N method with N=11 to capture this stable regime (P26-P36) while ignoring the preceding high-demand period (P16-P25). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock relative to the current mean (~118) and provides sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility within this regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a major downward shift from the high-demand period (P16-P25). Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), demand has averaged 121.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. In Period 37, demand was 144, resulting in a stockout (sold 119, ending inventory 0). This suggests that while the mean is stable, we need to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters reflect this most recent regime to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized regime (Period 26 to Period 37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized around 121 units (P26-P38 average is 120.3) with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by all history up to Period 38. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. To maintain the service level across this regime while accounting for the moderate volatility (range 79-144 since P26), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at P26 through P38). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical variance of this specific stable period, minimizing stockout risk while managing balancing holding costs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable regime since Period 26, following a major high-demand period. For the last 14 periods (P26-P39), demand has averaged approximately 121.3 units, with a range of 79 to 144. The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a mean of 124 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 39 concluded cycles. Since the current regime has been stable for 14 periods, I will use recent_N with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while filtering out the previous high-demand noise. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 121-124 units per period with appropriate safety stock for the observed variance (std \u2248 17.5 in this regime).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 26, following the high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current period (P41), the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P40 where demand (149) exceeded available stock (119). The demand average over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) is 122.13 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.9 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P37-P40) have seen a slight uptick in average demand (127.25 units) and volatility. Given the 0-period lead time is consistent and the product has a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (implying a 50% critical fractile), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this post-peak regime's mean and volatility. This setting allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer appropriate for the observed 119-149 unit range, addressing the recent stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P40) confirmed stable at ~122 units/period (range 79-149). Periodic stockouts occur when demand exceeds 140 units, suggesting volatility persists despite a lower mean compared to P16-P25.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current period (P42), the demand from Period 41 was 124 units, and the average since the regime shift at P26 (P26-P41) is approximately 122 units with a range of 79 to 149. Given that lead time remains consistently 0, the primary goal is to ensure ending inventory is minimized while covering the current period's demand (L=0 means review period + lead time = 1). I will use recent_N=16 to capture the entirety of this post-peak regime (P26-P41) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent stability (average ~122) against the observed volatility (max 149) to prevent the recurring stockouts seen when demand exceeds the mean.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a massive spike during Periods 16-25. The current average demand (Period 26-42) is approximately 122 units with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Despite this stability, the system has experienced stockouts in Periods 40, 41, and 42 because demand (149, 124, 143) occasionally exceeds the starting on-hand inventory. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy aims to cover the mean demand. However, to prevent frequent stockouts during this sustained regime of ~122 units, I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the entire current regime since P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current mean and volatility while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 122 units. Lead time is consistently 0. In the most recent periods (P41-P43), demand has been 124, 143, and 108, which aligns with this 'post-peak' regime. I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering Period 26 to Period 43) to capture the current regime's average and its inherent volatility. This provides a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs, especially since the product has an equal profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.5), making stockouts as costly as ending inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from a high-demand peak. For the last 19 periods (P26-P44), the average demand is approximately 122.5 units with a standard deviation of about 19.5 units. Recent demand in Period 44 (147) was higher than the average, resulting in an ending inventory of 0 and a stockout (as demand 147 exceeded on-hand 122). To minimize the risk of recurring stockouts during this stable but volatile regime, I am using a recent_N window of 19 periods (matching the start of this regime at Period 26) for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This aligns the OR backend's safety stock calculations with the current demand level. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, following a massive spike during Periods 16-25. For the current period (Period 46), I am analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 45. The mean demand in this window is approximately 122 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 45 because demand (126) slightly exceeded the starting on-hand (123). To maintain a high service level while balancing the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime and its inherent volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~122 mean plus a safety stock buffer to cover the periodic spikes above 140 units observed recently.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, following the high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the most recent 21 periods (P26-P46), the mean demand is approximately 124.5 units per period. In the last 6 periods specifically (P41-P46), demand has averaged 131.7 units with a range of 108 to 147. There are frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in P40, P41, P42, P44, P45, P46) because the lead time is 0, meaning the arrival happens after the decision but must cover that period's demand. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the service level target is 50%, but since stockouts are costly in terms of lost profit, I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) to capture the stabilized post-peak behavior while ensuring the OR backend accounts for the persistent volatility seen in this regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained remarkably stable since Period 26, following the high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current regime (P26-P47), the average demand is approximately 122.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.1. Recent data (P41-P47) shows an average demand of 129.6, slightly higher than the regime average, but still within the expected variation range (max 149 in P40). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the consistent stockouts whenever demand exceeds ~140, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full stability and variance of this post-peak regime while reacting slightly to the recent mild uptick. This ensures enough safety stock to handle peaks near 150 without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26 onwards) continues to be stable at ~123 units/period with persistent volatility (standard deviation ~19). No new demand shifts detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable post-peak regime since Period 26, characterized by an average demand of approximately 123 units per period (Avg P26-P48 \u2248 122.7). Although the mean has stabilized, the volatility remains significant (standard deviation \u2248 19), often leading to stockouts when demand peaks above 140 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 49, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 23 periods (N=23), which covers the entire duration of the current regime from Period 26 to the present. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the sustained levels of both mean demand and variance observed in this phase, maintaining an appropriate service level to minimize stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 123 units and a standard deviation of about 19. Period 49 showed a demand of 133, which slightly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory (124) resulting in a minor stockout, a common occurrence in this regime when demand exceeds the 120-130 range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. For the final period (Period 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent stable regime (starting P26, N=24) to ensure the OR backend captures this consistent behavior. N=24 is calculated as Period 49 - Period 26 + 1. This should provide a base stock level that covers the expected demand and historical volatility for the final period.
