The average demand is 95.6, with a noticeable upward trend in the last two periods. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in the arrival resolution phase of this same period and can satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize profit while accounting for the recent demand spike (reaching 136 in the latest sample), I will target an inventory level that covers this higher range. Since the lead time is 0, my current period's order must cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period).

While this could be a one-time dip, the volatility in this SKU warrants caution to avoid high holding costs ($1.0/unit). The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, I have 87 units on hand. Given the recent average demand of ~85 but the sharp drop to 28, I will target a safety stock level of approximately 100 units to cover potential demand recovery while minimizing excess inventory. Total units needed = 100. Current on-hand = 87. Required order = 100 - 87 = 13 units. If Period 16 was an outlier and demand returns to ~85, the 100 units (87 current + 13 new) will be sufficient.
