Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand of [82, 89, 65, 106, 136]. The average demand over these 5 samples is 95.6, and the standard deviation is 27.6. Since we have no specific calendar dates yet, I will use these 5 historical samples as a prior to set the base stock level. The promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant historical volatility and average while starting the game. As lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1, so the backend will calculate mu_hat as approximately 95.6 and sigma_hat as 27.6.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 108 units, which is higher than the average of the initial 5 samples (avg: 95.6, std: 26.5). On-hand inventory is currently low (32 units). Given the high demand in Period 1 (108 units) compared to the initial samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), there is high volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (95%). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (incorporating the five historical samples plus the Period 1 observation) to capture a more current demand distribution while acknowledging the zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods (immediate arrival). Demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical data samples (P1: 108 vs 82, P2: 144 vs 89). Consequently, there were stockouts in Period 2 (sold 139 versus demand of 144), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. The original historical samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) average around 95.6, but recent periods P1-P2 average 126. I will use recent_N to emphasize this higher demand trend and increase the safety stock via sigma_hat to prevent further lost sales given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2677.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend over the first few periods (P1: 108, P2: 144, P3: 142). The historical average demand is 131.3 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level (q) is approximately 0.95, meaning the OR backend should be more aggressive in stock-up to avoid lost sales. Looking at the data, the demand shifted after Period 1 (108 -> ~143 avg). Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods of data (P2 and P3) to reflect this higher demand regime. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: mean demand increased from 108 to approximately 143.

Daily Profit: $1596.00, Daily Holding Cost: $62.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1534.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (excluding Period 1) shows a shift toward higher consumption (Avg P2-P4: 123.3 units). Specifically, Period 2 (144) and Period 3 (142) were quite high, while Period 4 dipped to 84. Despite the dip in Period 4, the overall regime since Period 2 suggests a mean around 120-130 rather than the initial 108. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history (all orders arrived same-period). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand parameters to capture this increased mean and volatility while letting the OR engine handle the safety stock calculation based on the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio. This avoids overreacting to the single low data point in Period 4 while acknowledging the earlier spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $933.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Period 4: 84, Period 5: 55) shows a significant localized drop compared to the initial surge observed in Period 2 and 3. On-hand inventory is currently high (112 units), which is enough to cover nearly two average periods of chips(Regular) demand without additional arrivals given a 0-period lead time. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. Given the recent variability and the lower demand in the last two periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (Periods 3, 4, 5) to account for the downward trend while maintaining enough stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Period 2. The OR backend will automatically adjust for the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased; after a peak in Periods 2-3 (avg ~143), the last two periods (4-5) show a potential cooling or lower-regime shift (avg ~70).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1713.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we analyze the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand shows significant fluctuations: P1: 108, P2: 144, P3: 142, P4: 84, P5: 55, P6: 94. The 'carry-over insights' correctly noted a high-demand regime in P2-P3 (avg ~143) followed by a drop in P4-P5 (avg ~70). However, P6 showed a rebound to 94. Averaging the last three periods (P4-P6) gives a mean of 77.7, while the overall mean is 104.5. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level (critical ratio) will be very high (0.95), meaning it will naturally prioritize avoiding stockouts. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in all 6 concluding messages). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the post-initial-spike volatility while excluding the first period, balancing the recent cooling with the possibility of demand returning to the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 6 rebound (94) suggests the 'cooling' seen in P4-P5 (avg 70) may not be a permanent low-regime shift, but rather part of a high-variance pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2112.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear, stable regime. Demand over the last five periods (P3-P7) was 142, 84, 55, 94, and 114, averaging 97.8 units. The initial sample set provided (P1-P5 from user prompt: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136) also suggests a wide range. Current on-hand inventory is 54 units. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring immediate replenishment. Given the high variance and the shift from the low of P5 (55) back towards three-digit figures in P7 (114), I will use a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean more accurately than the long-term average. This choice balances the risk of stockouts during upward swings with the cost of holding inventory during downward swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. Since Period 1, demand has fluctuated between 50 and 144 units with no clear seasonal trend identifiable from the generic period labels. Recent history (P4-P8) shows a lower average demand (79.4 units) compared to the initial peak (P1-P3 avg: 131.3 units). However, given the high volatility (sigma), using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to adapt to the most recent behavior while acknowledging the high variance. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all eight concluded cycles, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor; the average of the last 5 periods (79.4) is significantly lower than the average of the first 3 (131.3), but individual spikes (P7) prevent classifying this as a stable low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2136.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. In Period 9, demand rebounded to 113, following a low of 50 in Period 8. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), the mean demand is 85.2 units, which is lower than the initial periods but characterized by wide swings (range 50-114). The promised lead time of 0 consistently holds true according to game history. With current on-hand inventory at 11 units and no units in-transit, there is a risk of stockout if demand remains high. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods) to capture the current mean of ~85 units while remaining responsive to the volatile nature of the SKU. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to properly account for the high historical variance observed in this recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high without a stable regime: the last 5 periods (P5-P9) show a mean of 85.2, but with a high variance (range 50 to 114), suggesting that a simple historical average may under-predict spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1283.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current on-hand inventory is 66 units with 0 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable within same period N). Demand has been volatile, ranging from 50 to 144. The average demand of all 10 periods is 97.5, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) is 88.4. However, the last two periods saw a sharp oscillation (113 then 71). Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) ($19/$20 = 0.95 critical fractile), the goal is to maintain a high service level to capture demand spikes without excessive overstocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=7 (P4-P10) covers the recent era of high volatility while smoothing out the extreme early peaks from P2-P3. This captures the mean of ~83 and the associated historical standard deviation to ensure a safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P7-P11) shows values of 114, 50, 113, 71, and 107. This represents a mean of 91, which is higher than the previous 5-period average (85.2) and suggests that we are in a high-volatility regime with frequent spikes above 100. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments. I will set the parameters using N=5 to capture this recent volatility while maintaining sufficient responsiveness to the observed spikes. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 5 periods to ensure the inventory levels are robust against the frequent demand increases observed in P9 (113) and P11 (107). Current on-hand is low (19), so a high service level is necessary to prevent stockouts in P12.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows high volatility with no stable regime. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand has been {50, 113, 71, 107, 110}, resulting in a mean of 90.2. This is an increase from the 'cooling' phase noted earlier but still below the initial peak. Given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (~95%), requiring us to protect against the frequent spikes (e.g., periods with demand > 110). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the current mean of ~90, as it reflects the most recent trend of demand stabilizing around this level compared to the all-time average.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a moderately high volatility regime over P8-P12, with a 5-period mean of 90.2, recovering from the P4-P5 low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked to 149, exceeding the starting on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. The current inventory position is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. All historical arrivals have shown a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time remains reliable. Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 110 units (113, 71, 107, 110, 149), which is higher than the previous 5-period average (90.2). Specifically, the last three periods show a rising trend (107, 110, 149). To prevent stockouts like those seen in P2 and P13, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility while maintaining a high service level (profit/cost ratio is very high at ~0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 11: 3-period mean has increased to 122 units from a previous 5-period average of 90.2 (+35%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1124.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Demand in the most recent period (P14) dropped significantly to 64 units, contrasting with the high demand in P13 (149). This high volatility suggests that while a regime shift was noted in Period 14, the actual variance is the dominant factor. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 107.5 units, which is a more stable estimate than the 3-period average previously used. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (approx. 95th percentile). By using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, we provide a balanced reflection of the current high-volatility environment while accounting for the recent spike-and-dip pattern, ensuring enough stock to cover potential spikes without excessive overstocking during dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1775.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 97, which is a return toward the mean after a volatile few periods. The 5-period average (P11-P15) is 105.4, while the 3-period average (P13-P15) is 103.3. There was a spike in P13 (149) followed by a dip in P14 (64), suggesting the higher regime noted in Carry-over Insights (P14) has moderated but remains higher than the P8-P12 average. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean of ~105 while weighting against recent volatility, and sigma_hat using recent_N of 5 to account for the high variance observed (ranging from 64 to 149 in the last five cycles). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover demand spikes while avoiding excessive inventory during dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand dropped significantly to 23 units, representing the lowest demand point in the history. This follows a period of high volatility where demand fluctuated between 64 and 149 units (P13-P15). Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the mean demand is 88.6 units, but the last two periods (64, 97, 23) suggest a cooling trend or simply high variance inherent to the product. Given the current on-hand inventory of 133 units, which is higher than the last 5-period average and much higher than the most recent demand, I will focus on stabilizing the base stock to prevent overstocking while accounting for potential spikes. I'll use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent high volatility and the low P16 demand, ensuring the OR backend can scale orders back while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $953.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows significant volatility. While Period 14 recorded a 3-period mean increase to 122, the subsequent periods (P14-P17) have seen a sharp cooling, with demands of 64, 97, 23, and 56 respectively. The mean of these last four periods is 60.0, a significant drop from the previous high regime. Given that the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, I am setting L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current low-demand phase and prevent overstocking, as ending inventory is currently high (111 units). For sigma_hat, I will use N=7 to incorporate the recent volatility spikes (e.g., the 97 in P15) into the safety stock calculation, ensuring we are protected against a sudden rebound while the mean forecast is adjusted downward.

Carry-over insight: Demand has entered a lower regime or high-volatility lull starting Period 14: the 4-period mean (P14-P17) has dropped to 60.0 units from the previous regime's 122 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory position is strong with 113 units on-hand. Examining the demand history, we are currently in a sustained low-demand regime that began at Period 14. The last five periods (P14-P18) show demand values of 64, 97, 23, 56, and 16, resulting in a mean of 51.2 units. This is a significant drop from the previous peak. The carry-over insight from Period 18 correctly identified this drop (calculated as 60.0 over P14-P17). Including Period 18's demand of 16 further lowers the average. Because the demand is highly volatile but currently trending lower, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime while maintaining a sigma_hat based on the same window to address the high variance. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed by all 18 conclude messages), so L remains at 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: 5-period mean (P14-P18) is 51.2 units, a 58% decrease from the P11-P13 peak of 122 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 14. The last 6 periods (P14-P19) show demands of 64, 97, 23, 56, 16, and 29, with a mean of 47.5 units. This is a significant drop compared to the previous peak of 122 or the long-term average. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) are particularly low (avg 33.6). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 6 (covering the entirety of this low-regime shift). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by the history of same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. The average demand for the most recent seven periods (P14-P20) is 49.4 units, which is a sharp decline from the previous peak of 122 units (P11-P13). Although Period 20 showed a slight uptick to 61 units, the overall trend remains in a lower-demand, high-volatility phase compared to the first half of the game. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units with no items in transit. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this lower-demand regime while still protecting against the high volatility (spikes like Period 20's 61), I will use the last 7 periods (the length of the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 'new normal' rather than the much higher historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 solidified: 7-period mean (P14-P20) is 49.4 units, representing a sustained ~60% decrease from the P11-P13 peak.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 14. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P14-P21) is 45.0 units (64, 97, 23, 56, 16, 29, 61, 14), which is a substantial decrease from the previous peak of 122 units (P11-P13). Period 21 specifically showed very low demand (14). I will use N=8 to capture this entire lower-demand regime while providing enough data points to mitigate the high volatility observed within this period (range 14-97). Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in all historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 83, which already exceeds the recent mean, meaning the OR backend will likely order zero or very few units. The parameters are designed to reflect the current low-demand environment to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for potential spikes back towards the 60-90 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1266.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the low-volume, high-volatility regime that started around Period 14. The 9-period mean demand from Period 14 to Period 22 is 47.5 units, with considerable variance (ranging from 14 to 97). The last two periods (P21: 14, P22: 68) demonstrate this persistent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. Given the current on-hand inventory of 26 units and the observed demand volatility, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (regime since Period 14) to capture this lower average while maintaining a high sigma_hat (also using the last 9 periods) to protect against spikes like those seen in P15 or P22. The inventory currently covers approximately 55% of the recent mean demand, necessitating a replenishment order to reach the target base stock and ensure a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the mean demand is 45.6 units, which is significantly lower than the earlier stages of the game. Despite high period-to-period volatility (ranging from 14 to 97), the overall average has stabilized at this lower level. Currently, there are 67 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to maintain enough stock to cover the upcoming period's demand. The OR backend uses a service level of ~95% (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1)). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't over-order and incur excessive holding costs while still protecting against the observed volatility spikes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 11 periods (P14-P24), the average demand is 45.0 units, with recent fluctuations between 14 and 68. The last four periods (P21-P24) show an average of 37.25 units. Although there are occasional spikes (e.g., P22 at 68), the overall trend remains significantly lower than the early game peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level for potential small spikes while avoiding excess holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 52, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (the duration of this low-demand regime). This N=11 captures the current volatility (std dev approx 19.5) and mean (45.0), ensuring the base stock level covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for the next period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 14 has been sustained for 12 periods (P14-P25), with a mean demand of approximately 43.8 units compared to the earlier high-demand periods. In the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25), the mean demand is 36.0 units with relatively lower volatility compared to the earlier game history. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Given the current on-hand inventory of 58 units, which already covers 1.6 periods of the recent average demand, the goal is to maintain a buffer that accounts for the potential low-regime variance while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $19/unit profit). I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current lower-demand regime while filtering out the high-volume noise from Period 13 and earlier.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P14-P25) stabilized: 12-period mean is 43.8 units, down ~60% from prior average. Volatility has also noticeably decreased within this regime compared to the first half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant demand spike in Period 26 (112 units), which sharply exceeds the previously established low-demand regime (mean ~44). This spike resulted in 0 ending inventory and lost sales (sold 86 vs 112 demand). Given the history of high volatility and regime shifts (e.g., P11-P13), this spike may signal either a temporary outlier or the start of a new higher-demand phase. To ensure adequate service levels while managing high volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent upward trend (P22-P26: 68, 28, 39, 31, 112; mean = 55.6), but I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 35 to account for the heavy-tailed nature of these spikes (the StdDev of those 5 periods is ~35). Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains intense; the low-regime identified since P14 was disrupted by a significant spike in P26 (112 units), suggesting potential for sudden regime reversion or continued high-variance behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $726.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike in Period 26 (112 units) followed by Period 27 (42 units) indicates that while the 'low-demand regime' of P14-P25 (avg ~44) might be shifting, demand remains highly volatile rather than settling into a new high-stable regime. The mean of the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 61.7, whereas the mean since the major shift in Period 14 (P14-P27) is 45.1. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent spike without over-correcting for a single outlier, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 (spanning the late shift period to capturing both the stability and the recent volatility). This balances the low-volume base with enough variance to cover spikes. For L, I continue using 'calculate' as lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in P26-P27; the 12-period stability (P14-P25) has shifted into a high-variance phase with a 3-period mean of 61.7 vs the prior 43.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of high volatility, with significant spikes returning in P26 (112) and P28 (108), disrupting the prolonged low-demand regime seen from P14-P25. The 3-period mean (P26-P28) is 87.3, compared to the prior 12-period mean of 43.8, suggesting a potential reversion to the higher demand levels seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit, making this a critical ordering period to avoid further stockouts (as seen in P26 and P28). I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent spike without overreacting to individual data points, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat (mean ~61.4) and sigma_hat. This balances the recent high demand (112, 108) with the preceding lower values (31, 42). Setting these parameters will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the increased service level requirements driven by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; the stability observed P14-P25 (avg 43.8) has ended with P26-P28 showing a return to high-demand spikes (avg 87.3), indicating a potential regime shift or shift in variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance phase since Period 26, effectively ending the stable low-demand regime seen between P14 and P25. In the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has alternated between significant spikes (112, 108) and moderate lows (42, 52), resulting in a recent 4-period mean of approximately 78.5. This is nearly double the average of the previous stable regime (~43.8). Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers these potential spikes while minimizing holding costs on the lower-demand periods. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent shift in mean and volatility, and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance. This allows the OR backend to calculate a safety stock appropriate for the current high-volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: High-variance regime confirmed Period 26-29: The stable low-demand period (P14-P25) has ended. Current 4-period mean is 78.5 with standard deviation of approximately 36 units, signaling a return to erratic, higher-volume spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1281.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly since Period 26. After a long period of low stability (P14-P25, avg ~43.8), the demand has become highly volatile with a higher mean. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show demand values of 112, 42, 108, 52, and 71, resulting in a mean of 77.0 and a high standard deviation (approx 31.5). This indicates a return to a high-variance, higher-volume regime. To capture this recent behavior without being skewed by the old low-volume regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P30 order arrived in P30). The on-hand inventory is 68, and the backend with these parameters will target a base stock reflecting this higher volatility to avoid the stockouts seen in P26 and P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1150.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a stable low-volume period (P14-P25, mean ~44) into a higher-variance phase starting at P26. The last 6 periods (P26-P31) show a mean of 74.8 units with substantial variability (range 42 to 112). Using a recent window (N=6) captures this return to higher demand levels and increased volatility better than the long-term historical average. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals in the same period of ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-variance regime since Period 26: 6-period mean is 74.8, up 70% from the P14-P25 low-demand period (43.8).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance, moderate-to-high demand phase starting at Period 26. The mean demand of the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 77.4, which is a significant increase from the 43.8 average seen in the prior low-demand cycle (P14-P25). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To address the current high volatility (standard deviation of ~26 in the current regime) and avoid stockouts like those seen in P26 and P28, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 7 most recent samples (N=7). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current spike-prone environment while maintaining the high service level (CR=0.95) required by the $19 profit margin.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a stable low-regime (P14-P25) into a sustained high-variance/high-mean regime since Period 26. The 8-period mean for P26-P33 is 73.9 units, compared to the previous 12-period mean of 43.8 units. The presence of significant spikes (P26: 112, P28: 108, P32: 93) necessitates a higher safety stock. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L is set to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=8 to capture this new regime starting at P26. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the heightened mean and variance observed over the last 8 periods, ensuring better coverage against the current volatility while holding enough inventory to satisfy high-demand spikes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-variance/high-volume regime since Period 26, following the low-demand phase (P14-P25). The 9-period mean from P26 to P34 is approximately 75.7 units (112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93, 69, 88), which is a significant increase from the previous 43.8 average. The variance is also high, with demand frequently spiking around 90-110 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N = 9 to capture this specific regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period), so L will be set to the promised 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently low (31), making a robust base-stock calculation essential to avoid stockouts during the next demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-variance regime since P26 confirmed: 9-period mean (P26-P34) is 75.7, a ~73% increase from the P14-P25 low regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-variance, higher-volume regime that began around Period 26. The 10-period mean from Period 26 to Period 35 is approximately 73.3 units, significantly higher than the previous low-regime average (~43.8). Explicitly, the last 4 periods (P32-P35) have been very stable at a high level (93, 69, 88, 92), with a 4-period mean of 85.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a service level around 95% is optimal. I will use the recent 10-period regime (P26-P35) to set the base stock parameters to capture this increased demand and volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the current high-variance regime while smoothing out the most extreme spikes like Period 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1162.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to fluctuate within the high-variance regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has ranged from 42 to 112 with a mean of approximately 76.5 over the last 11 periods. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P32-P36) show a mean of 81.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable as evidenced by all orders desde P1 arriving within the same period. To capture the current higher volume and moderate volatility while minimizing holding costs (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 11 periods (P26-P36) to define the current regime. This covers the entire duration since the identified regime shift, providing a robust sample size (N=11) for calculating expected demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

LLM Rationale:
Since Period 26, the demand has shifted to a high-variance regime with a mean of approximately 78.4 units. While the last two periods (P36-P37) show demand in the 50-60 range, the historical pattern in this regime includes frequent spikes over 100. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use recent_N=12 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current active regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-variance regime since Period 26. The most recent 10-period mean (P29-P38) is 71.8 units, while the 5-period mean (P34-P38) is 74.2 units. Although the last three periods (P36-P38) show slightly lower demand (64, 56, 71), the inherent volatility observed throughout the game's history (with spikes over 100 units as seen in P26 and P28) suggests maintaining a higher safety stock. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the current high-variance regime at P26) to capture the current mean while smoothing recent noise, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=13 to account for the heightened volatility of this regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against spikes without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-variance regime since Period 26: 13-period mean (P26-P38) is approximately 75.3 units, significantly higher than the P14-P25 low of 43.8 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-variance regime since Period 26, with a 14-period mean (P26-P39) of 76.6 units. The most recent demand (P39) was 94 units, maintaining this higher average compared to the previous low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 39 conclude' message showing the P39 order arrived within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is low (17 units) and there are no units in-transit, I will use a 14-period window (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the detected changepoint at Period 26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical volatility of this current regime while minimizing the risk of stockouts during demand spikes.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-variance regime since Period 26. The 15-period mean (P26-P40) is 76.6 units, which is consistent with the established carry-over insight. In the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), the mean is 72.8 units with a range of 56 to 94, confirming that while volume has slightly dipped compared to the early-P30s spike, volatility remains the primary driver. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Given a high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a service level of ~95% is optimal. I will use a recent_N of 15 periods to capture this specific post-P26 regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory level is robust against the frequent 90+ unit spikes seen in this segment.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-variance, higher-volume regime since Period 26. The 16-period average from P26 to P41 is 78.1 units, with recent demand showing consistent strength (P39: 94, P40: 79, P41: 93). Current on-hand inventory is low at 18 units, necessitating a substantial order to meet immediate demand. I will use the last 16 periods (regime starting P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current level of volatility and mean demand while filtering out the unrelated low-demand period (P14-P25). Lead time is consistently 0, so L=0 is maintained.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-variance regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data shows a 17-period mean (P26-P42) of approximately 75.8 units. The very last 5 periods (P38-P42) show a mean of 76.4 units, confirming stability around this higher level despite individual fluctuations (like P42's 45 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to avoid stockouts during demand spikes while managing mid-range inventory levels. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 17-period regime (N=17) and sigma_hat to capture the elevated volatility of this same period to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high-variance spikes seen frequently since P26. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1409.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains active, characterized by high variance and an average demand of approximately 75 units. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), the mean demand has been 77.4 units (94, 79, 93, 45, 76), which aligns with the overall average of the current high-variance phase. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the relatively low on-hand inventory of 35 units compared to the mean demand and high volatility, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the period from the start of the current regime at P26 to now) to provide a stable yet responsive base stock that accounts for the observed spikes.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a consistent high-variance regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 19 periods (P26-P44), the mean demand is approximately 76.5 units. The last 5 periods (P40-P44) show a very similar mean of 75.6 units, indicating the regime is stable. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (25 units) after a demand of 85 in P44. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=19 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current stable but high-variance regime, ensuring the base stock covers the anticipated 75-80 units of demand while accounting for the significant volatility observed since P26.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in the high-variance demand regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 75.3 units (Period 26-45 mean is 76.7). The last 3 periods (P43-P45) show a mean of 78.0, confirming the regime is stable but volatile. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this current high-variance regime (P26-P45) while filtering out the previous low-demand period (P14-P25). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that accounts for approximately one period of demand (L+1=1) plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility, ensuring we cover potential spikes like those seen in P26 and P28.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently high-variance regime since Period 26. Since P26, the demand mean is approximately 75.8 units (calculated from P26-P46) with a standard deviation of about 19.3. The most recent demand at Period 46 (60 units) is slightly below this mean but within the expected high-variance range. Lead time has been remarkably stable at 0 periods throughout the entire game. Given that we are near the end of the game (Period 47 of 50), I will prioritize maintaining enough inventory to satisfy this high-variance demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=21 to capture the entirety of this stable high-variance regime starting at P26. Since lead time is consistently 0, L=0 (default) is appropriate. This configuration allows the OR backend to target a base stock level that accounts for the observed ~76 unit mean plus a safety buffer derived from the recent volatility (z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-variance regime since Period 26. The mean demand for this recent regime (P26-P47, 22 samples) is approximately 75.8 units with a standard deviation of roughly 20.8. The latest performance (P43-P47) shows a consistent mean of 74.4, aligning with the P26+ average. Given the game ends in Period 50, and actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the current high-variance regime (starting from P28) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the average volume and the characteristic spikes, minimizing stockouts like those seen in P26 and P28.

Carry-over insight: High-variance regime (P26-P47) confirmed stable: mean demand ~76 units, standard deviation ~21. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49. The demand in Period 48 spiked to 143, which is significantly higher than the previous 23-period mean of ~76 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The high-variance regime identified since Period 26 is still active, but this recent spike suggests a possible upward shift or extreme volatility. Since this is the penultimate period (49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy the remaining demand for Period 49 and Period 50 without over-stocking at the very end. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the regime from P26-P48) to capture the current mean and variance while reflecting the recent spike in the calculation. This balances the risk of another spike in the final periods against the cost of leftover inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand volatility remains significant within the P26 regime, evidenced by a Period 48 spike of 143 units (approx 2x the regime mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1243.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The demand regime has been categorized as high-variance since Period 26, with a 24-period mean of approximately 77.0. The recent spike in Period 48 (143 units) confirms that while the mean is stable, the variance remains high. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. For this final period, I will use a recent_N of 24 to capture the entire current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring sufficient stock to cover potential spikes without excessive holding cost, although ending inventory holding costs for the very last period are typically irrelevant to the next decision. The goal is to set the base stock high enough to satisfy the expected demand of approximately 77-80 units plus a safety margin for the observed high volatility.
