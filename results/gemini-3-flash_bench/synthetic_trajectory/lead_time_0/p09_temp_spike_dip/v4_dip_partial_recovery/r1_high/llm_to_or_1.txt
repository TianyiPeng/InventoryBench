Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), implying a high target service level. Promised lead time is 0. Historical demand data for the first five periods (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) shows an upward trend (mean: 95.6, std: ~26.9). Since we are currently in Period 1 but have 5 samples provided, I will use these samples to set the initial parameters. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand average and standard deviation to cover 1+L (1) periods. L is set to 'default' (0) as we have no evidence yet of lead time drift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 (order arrived in the same period), consistent with the promised lead time. The demand history for the first five periods (pre-game) was 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. Period 1 game demand was 85. There's a slight upward trend in the pre-game data (106, 136), but Period 1 (85) suggests volatility rather than a sustained high regime. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations and 'calculate' for lead time to monitor for any drift from the current 0-day observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2427.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 24 units. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is 0 periods (confirmed by Period 1 and Period 2 concludes). Demand for the first two periods was 85 and 129, showing high volatility. The demand sequence (including pre-game samples) is 82, 89, 65, 106, 136, 85, 129. Average daily demand is approximately 98.8. Since lead time is 0, we need to ensure local inventory covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full recent history including the two periods played, as demand appears to be trending slightly upward but remains volatile. Profit per unit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1.0), so the OR engine will naturally target a high service level (~95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2498.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant upward trend (85, 129, 132, 106, 136). The mean of the first three periods was roughly 115, but the last two periods (Period 4 and 5) have averaged 121, with 136 being the highest recorded. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (~95%). Since on-hand inventory is low (10 units) and there are no units in transit, I need to set parameters that ensure sufficient stock for the next period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand mean to capture the recent high volume, and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4: Mean demand increasing from ~115 to ~125 (+8%). Observed lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Profit: $2052.00, Daily Holding Cost: $51.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2001.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Demand has shown a significant upward shift starting from Period 4 (moving from an average of ~95 to ~120), with Period 5 demand reaching 136. Although the Carry-over Insight from Period 4 estimated a shift to ~125, the most recent samples (Period 4: 108, Period 5: 136) suggest a higher mean and increased volatility in this new regime. To allow the OR backend to adjust quickly to this higher demand level while balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a high service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the upward trend since Period 3. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 (P1-P3) to ~122 (P4-P5) following two consecutive periods of 100+ demand, with a peak of 136 in P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2415.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The demand for the last five periods has been: 85, 129, 132, 108, 128 (calculated from starting inventory + arrived - ending inventory). Note: The user-provided prompt data for Periods 1-5 (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) contradicts the 'Game History' (85, 129, 132, 108, 128). I will prioritize the 'Game History' as it represents the ground truth of the environment execution. Mean demand over the first 5 periods is 116.4. However, after the initial period (85), a higher regime is visible: the average of P2-P5 is 124.25. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=1 period. With a high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the target service level q is 0.95. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg 124.25) and use 'recent_N' for sigma to account for the volatility seen in this regime. This ensures we carry enough stock to meet the 100+ demand units expected while minimizing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1877.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 0 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving in the same period they were placed (P1-P6). Demand has stabilized in a higher regime than at the start. Since Period 2, we've seen demand figures of 129, 132, 108, 128, and 101. The average demand over these last 5 periods (P2-P6) is approximately 119.6 units. While P4 and P5 initially suggested a significant spike (108, 128, 136 in the user history - note: the user history provided at the end has slightly different numbers than the introductory 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' block; I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' section), the last demand observation was 101. Given the lead time is 0, the review period + lead time is 1 period (L+1=1). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean of ~120 units and account for the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 119-120 range while remaining responsive to the slight cooling seen in P6 (101).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2077.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the very early periods. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P4-P7), the demand values are 108, 128, 101, and 111, resulting in a mean of approximately 112. This is slightly lower than the initial peak in P5 but remains significantly higher than the P1-P3 levels. The lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrivals for all orders placed so far (P1 through P7). Since the demand regime appears stable around this new level, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current trend for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects recent volatility and needs while ignoring the lower initial samples. Given a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), requiring robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~112 units/period (observed P4-P7). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (sold 131 units of 134 demanded), leaving ending on-hand inventory at 0. The demand average from Period 4 to Period 8 is approximately 116.4 units (108, 128, 101, 111, 134). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To account for the recent demand levels and the stockout event, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the higher demand regime observed since Period 4, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover demand in the upcoming period without excessive holding costs, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is quite high (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 8: demand (134) exceeded starting inventory (131). Demand regime since P4 maintains a mean of ~116.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1400.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current on-hand inventory is 63. Looking at the history, the demand regime since Period 4 has shown some volatility, with a recent high of 134 in Period 8 followed by a lower 77 in Period 9. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is roughly (108+128+101+111+134+77)/6 = 109.8 units. The stockout in Period 8 suggests the previous base stock levels were slightly too low to handle upward spikes (the OR engine uses a quantile based on Profit $19 and Holding $1, which is q=19/20=0.95, a high service level). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current regime's mean and variability since the shift at Period 4, ensuring we have enough buffer for the high service level required for this high-margin product while noting the recent dip in P9 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1296.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 72, following a demand of 77 in Period 9. This suggests a significant drop from the mean of ~116 observed between Periods 4-8. Since Period 9, the mean has shifted down to ~74.5 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the system naturally targets a high service level (~95%). However, because the recent demand (P9-P10) is significantly lower than the previous regime, using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat will allow the OR engine to adapt quickly to this lower demand level while maintaining safety stock based on recent volatility. On-hand inventory is 72, and there are no units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand dropped from ~116 (P4-P8) to ~74.5 (P9-P10), a decrease of approx 35%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1539.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system faced a stockout because the starting inventory (81) was insufficient to meet the demand (99). The demand in P11 (99) is significantly higher than the low levels seen in P9 (77) and P10 (72), suggesting the 'low demand' regime identified in the carry-over insights may have been a temporary dip rather than a sustained shift, or that volatility is higher than previously estimated. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the cost of understocking (stockouts) is much higher than the cost of overstocking. To recover from back-to-back stockouts or near-zero inventory levels and capture potential demand variability, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the data since the stabilization at P4) to smooth out the recent dip while accounting for the recent spike to 99. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to capture the variance during this period of high fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 9: after a significant dip in P9-P10 (avg 74.5), demand rebounded to 99 in P11, suggesting the P9-P10 period was a localized dip rather than a permanent regime shift.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 68 units, continuing a period of higher volatility. Since Period 9, demand has been 77, 72, 99 (stockout), and 68. This averages to 79 units/period. The Carry-over Insights correctly noted a significant dip starting Period 9. While Period 11 saw a spike to 99, the surrounding data suggests a lower mean than the P4\u2013P8 period (~116). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L=0 (default) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (P9\u2013P12) which reflects this lower, more volatile demand level. This will help prevent overstocking while account for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 9 (P9-P12) has shifted downward to a mean of 79 units (a ~32% decrease from P4-P8 mean of 116), though variance remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1578.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 9. Analyzing the most recent stable phase (Period 9 to Period 13), the mean demand is 80.0 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84). While Period 11 saw a stockout due to insufficient starting inventory (81), the actual demand was 99. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend's target service level is high (95%), and the base stock policy (using mu_hat and sigma_hat) will ensure we satisfy this. I will use a window of N=5 (P9-P13) to capture this lower but volatile demand regime accurately. Setting L=0 explicitly to match the reliable history.

Carry-over insight: Consistent demand regime identified from Period 9-13 with a mean of 80 units and continued 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. Examining the history, the lead time is consistently 0 periods. The demand regime starting around Period 9 showed a downward trend (avg ~79), but recent data (Period 14 demand of 111) suggests a return to higher volatility or a shift back towards the older mean of ~115. Specifically, Period 14 ended in a stockout (demand 111 > inventory 101), marking the second stockout in the last four periods (P11 and P14). To avoid lost sales given the high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1) ratio, I need to account for this recent 'bounce' in demand. I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 9-14) to capture the lower regime mean while allowing the variance to buffer against the recent high-demand observation. L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased recently: Period 14 saw demand of 111 units, which is significantly higher than the P9-P13 average of 80 units, leading to a stockout. This suggests the downward regime shift at Period 9 may be correcting or exhibits higher variance than previously estimated.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 84 units, following a high of 111 in Period 14. Looking at the history since Period 9, demand has been erratic: 77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111, 84. The mean for these last 7 periods is approximately 85 units, but the volatility is high (standard deviation approx 15). The carry-over insights correctly identified a downward shift at Period 9, but recent periods (P11 and P14) show spikes that risk stockouts if we only target the mean. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs with a 0-period lead time, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatile period (P9-P15) while ensuring the OR engine computes a base stock that covers the elevated variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 9 (P9-P15) established at a mean of ~85 units with increased volatility compared to the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand dropped significantly to 28 units, which is a major outlier compared to the Period 9-15 regime average of ~85 units. While 'Carry-over insights' suggest a regime mean of ~85, the high volatility (stockouts in P11 and P14, and now a sharp drop in P16) requires a cautious approach. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the recent demand regime since the downward shift at P9 (N=8) to set mu_hat, rather than reacting solely to the P16 outlier, to avoid under-stocking. However, given the extreme variance recently, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (P9-P16) to capture the current volatility while maintaining a balanced mean. The backend OR logic (profit=$19, holding=$1) naturally target a high service level (~95%), which protects against the stockouts seen recently despite the low demand in P16.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility in demand regime since Period 9: Demand ranges from 28 to 111 (mean ~78) with frequent stockouts (P11, P14) followed by sharp drops (P16). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 43 units, following a sharp drop to 28 in Period 16. The demand regime starting from Period 9 has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from 28 to 111. The current regime (P9-P17) has an average demand of approximately 75 units, significantly lower than the previous regime (P4-P8 avg: ~116). However, the high variance and recent stockouts (P11, P14) suggest that we must maintain a protective buffer to handle potential spikes. Since lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed), I will set L to 0. I will use the recent 9 periods (P9-P17) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-mean but higher-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $683.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Since Period 9, the mean demand has decreased significantly and established a new, highly volatile baseline. For the last 10 periods (P9-P18), the mean demand is 70.8 units, though this hides significant variance with values ranging from 28 to 111. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a sharp decline (28, 43, 40), with a 3-period average of 37 units. This may indicate a temporary slump or a new low-demand regime. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 19/20 = 0.95), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. However, ordering based on the full P9-P18 history (mean ~71) while current demand is ~40 would result in excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the broad volatility of the current era (P9 onwards) but will monitor for further stabilization at the lower levels observed in the last 3 periods. Lead time remains stably at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime since Period 16: demand has local mean of ~37 (P16-P18), significantly lower than the P9-P15 mean of ~85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1025.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a distinct low-demand regime. Since Period 16, demand values have been 28, 43, 40, and 57, resulting in a 4-period mean of approximately 42 units. This is significantly lower than the previous regime (P9-P15) which averaged ~85 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 58 units, which is slightly above the recent mean, the OR backend needs updated parameters to avoid overstocking while accounting for the high volatility observed in this SKU's history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-demand state and adjust for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~42 units (P16-P19), a reduction of approx 50% from the P9-P15 average of 85 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand (P16-P20), we observe values of 28, 43, 40, 57, and 43. This results in a mean of 42.2 units per period, which is a significant drop (~50%) from the P9-P15 average of 85. The volatility is also lower compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period from P1 to P20. Given the stability of the new lower-demand regime over the last 5 periods, I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize the most recent behavior while maintaining some statistical sensitivity. Lead time estimation will use 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at the promised value of 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Since then (P16-P21), demand observations are [28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33], resulting in a mean of approximately 40.7 units. This represents a sustained decrease from the previous regime (P9-P15 mean ~85). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this lower volume and the associated volatility of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent 50% drop in demand, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit margin.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from P16 to P22 (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49), the mean demand is approximately 41.8 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is low (9 units), necessitating an order. Given the stability of this current low-demand regime over the last 7 periods, I will use a recent_N window of 7 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the current average while maintaining enough sensitivity to the observed variance in this specific regime to avoid stockouts, as seen in earlier periods when volatility was underestimated. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (service level target ~95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-22 is highly stable with a mean of ~42 units, confirming the significant downward shift from previous levels (~80-116).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, following a significant downward shift. From Period 16 to Period 23, the mean demand is approximately 41.1 units (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. Recent demand volatility is moderate, but to ensure high service levels given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a base stock policy covering the current demand regime (N=8) is appropriate. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 samples (starting from Period 16) where the regime shifted.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, following a significant downward shift. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 42.5 units (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36, 54), with a standard deviation of approximately 9.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a replenishment order to meet Period 25 demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the statistics of this current stable demand regime, and 'default' for L as the 0-period lead time is consistent and promised.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~42 since Period 16, but recent data from Period 24 (54 units) and Period 25 (56 units) suggests a slight upward trend or higher localized variance. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). To prevent potential stockouts if demand continues to exceed the previous mean of ~42, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable-to-slightly-rising regime (Periods 16-25), while also setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the actual observed volatility in this window. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand with an appropriate safety buffer based on the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P25 shows a mean of ~45, with a slight upward trend in P24-P25 (avg 55) compared to P16-P23 (avg 42). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the product stocked out (sold 61 units with demand of 77). This confirms the upward trend noted in the Carry-over Insights (P24-P25 average was 55, now P26 is 77). The demand regime starting at Period 16 (mean ~45) is shifting upwards. Lead time remains consistently 0. To address the stockout and the shifting mean, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat focusing on the last 11 periods (P16-P26) to capture this regime's characteristics while giving the backend enough samples (N=11) to account for the recent rise. L is set to default as the actual lead time is consistently 0, matching the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 24: mean demand increasing from ~42 (P16-P23) to ~62 (P24-P26), a ~47% increase. P26 demand (77) caused a stockout, confirming a return to higher volatility/demand levels.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 24. Demand values for P24-P27 are [54, 56, 77, 75], yielding a mean of 65.5, compared to the previously stabilized mean of ~42 (P16-P23). Two consecutive stockouts in P26 and P27 confirm that the system is currently under-ordering relative to this new regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the internal OR logic should target a high service level. For Period 28, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this upward shift in both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels rise to meet the ~65-75 demand range. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead time has been perfectly stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 24 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~42 (P16-P23) to 65.5 (P24-P27), a ~56% increase, resulting in stockouts at P26 and P27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 24. Previously (P16-P23), demand averaged ~42 units. In the last five periods (P24-P28), demand values were 54, 56, 77, 75, and 47, resulting in a mean of 61.8. While Period 28 saw a dip to 47, the previous four periods suggest a higher baseline and increased volatility, leading to stockouts in P26 and P27. The current on-hand inventory is 39 units. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture this new, more volatile, and higher-demand regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend adjusts for the recent mean of ~62 units and the corresponding variance, providing a higher service level to prevent further stockouts in this higher-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1416.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent shift starting around Period 24. Demand in this latest regime (P24-P29) has a mean of approximately 64 units (54, 56, 77, 75, 47, 75), which is a significant increase from the previous stable mean of ~42 (P16-P23). Stockouts in P26 and P27 confirm that the previous parameters were insufficient for this higher volume. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. For Period 30, I will use recent_N to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. I am setting N=6 to align with the start of the current shift (Period 24). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the ~64 unit mean and the observed variance in this higher-demand period, aiming to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has moved from a mean of ~42 (P16-P23) to a mean of 68.0 (P24-P30), with values consistently higher (54, 56, 77, 75, 47, 75, 92). The most recent demand of 92 units in Period 30 resulted in a stockout (starting inventory was 86). To react to this sustained increase and higher volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P24-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. The lead time L is consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~42 to 68.0 (+62%) over the last 7 periods, with associated stockouts in P26, P27, and P30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 24. For the period P24-P31, the mean demand is approximately 66.4 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~14.6) and multiple stockouts (P26, P27, P30). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this higher-demand regime and its volatility while minimizing stockout risk (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term history. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1488.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 24. For the most recent 9 periods (P24-P32), the mean demand has increased to approximately 67.8 units (54, 56, 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79). This is a significant increase from the previous mean of ~45 (P16-P23). Stockouts occurred in Periods 26, 27, and 30, indicating that current inventory levels are struggling to keep up with the increased volatility and mean. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this new higher-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~14.6 in the last 9 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9. This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock to a level that mitigates the frequent stockouts seen in the last 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1767.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher and more volatile regime since Period 24. Reviewing recent demand (P24-P33): 54, 56, 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79, 116. This averages ~72.6 units/period, but notably, Period 33 hit 116 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The last three periods (P31-P33) average 83.3 units. Given the critical stockout in P33 and the upward trend, I will set N=10 for mu_hat to capture this entire high-demand regime since P24 (avg ~73), but I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 24 reinforced: Mean demand increased from ~42 to ~73 units (+73%), with high volatility (peak 116 in P33) and multiple stockouts (P26, P27, P30, P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1466.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by a higher mean and increased volatility, with an average demand of approximately 73 units and a standard deviation around 20 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals. Period 33 specifically saw a demand spike to 116 units, while Period 34 returned toward the mean at 79. Since the lead time is 0, the backend's base stock calculation effectively covers one period of demand (current period). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 (P24 to P34) to capture this current volatile regime while ignoring the previous lower-demand period (P16-P23) which would bias mu_hat downward. This ensures the service level remains high enough to prevent further stockouts observed in P26, P27, P30, and P33.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 24 and has stabilized over the last 12 periods (P24-P35). During this interval, the mean demand is approximately 74.1 units (890 total units / 12 periods), with significant volatility (high of 116, low of 47). The most recent demand (P34-P35) remains within this range at 79 and 84 units. Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, and there is no pipeline inventory because lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend logic should target a high service level. To capture the current regime's behavior while accounting for recent volatility and stockouts (P26, P27, P30, P33), I am selecting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P24 environment accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 24-35 is stable with a mean of ~74 units and high volatility (StdDev ~19 units), significant for setting service levels given 0-period lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume, high-volatility regime starting from Period 24. Since Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 74.4 units with a standard deviation of about 19.3. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The product has a high critical ratio (profit $19 vs holding cost $1), necessitating a high service level to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently in this latest regime (P26, P27, P30, P33). I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering P24 to P36) to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while ignoring older, irrelevant data. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current ~74 unit average and the significant variance observed recently.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 24 is characterized by a higher mean and significant volatility. Over the last 14 periods (P24-P37), the mean demand has stabilized around 76 units, with frequent peaks exceeding 90 units (P26, P27, P30, P33). The most recent four periods (P34-P37) show very stable demand (79, 84, 83, 82), suggesting the volatility might be dampening or we are in a temporary period of stability within the broader high-demand regime. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N window of 14 periods for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the higher demand levels seen since the P24 shift while excluding the extremely low demand period from P16-P23. This N=14 choice balances recent stability with the risk of demand spikes seen earlier in the regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 24 is characterized by a mean demand of approximately 74 units with high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 19). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show high stability with demands of 79, 84, 83, 82, and 77, resulting in a recent mean of 81 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95 given $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the recent stability and historical volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to capture the full breadth of the current high-demand regime, and explicit sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against the observed spikes (e.g., 116 in P33).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 74 units. Period 39 continued this pattern with a demand of 77 units, matching the previous period and following a string of consistent observations (84, 83, 82, 77, 77). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To calculate the base stock, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 (covering Period 24 to Period_39) to prioritize this current stable yet high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current mean (~74) and the observed variance to prevent stockouts seen earlier in this regime (P26, P27, P30, P33) while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been highly stable since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 74.3 units and a standard deviation of 19.1 units. Over the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has been exceptionally consistent (83, 82, 77, 77, 74), averaging 78.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the full stability of the regime since P24 while ensuring the mean and variance reflect the sustained higher volume compared to the pre-P24 slump. This accounts for the observed volatility (spikes like 116 in P33) while correctly modeling the current mean.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized around a mean of ~74 units, but very recent periods (P38-P41) show a slight cooling trend with demand averaging ~74.25 and a tight range (69-77). However, looking at the broader Period 24-41 regime, the mean is approximately 76 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the regime from P24 onwards) to capture the current structural demand level while allowing for the high variance observed in this phase (e.g., the peak of 116 in P33). Sigma_hat will also use N=18 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the volatility of this specific regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P24-P41 is stable at a mean of ~76 units with persistent 0-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 24 with a mean of approximately 76 units. In the most recent period (P42), demand dropped to 42, which is notably lower than the recent average but within the historical range of volatility for this SKU. Given the 0-period lead time, the system is highly responsive to orders placed in the same period. I will continue to use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=19 (Period 24 to 42) to capture the current stable regime's statistics while acknowledging the high volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0, so the default method is appropriate. The on-hand inventory is 60, which covers the lower end of expected demand, so an order will be generated by the OR backend to restore the base stock level reflecting the service level for high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 76 units. Although Period 42 saw a dip to 42, the demand rebounded to 76 in Period 43, confirming that the long-term mean of the current regime (~74-76) is still the best predictor. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the recent regime (last 20 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory covers the current demand level plus a safety buffer for the high observed volatility. N=20 is chosen to capture the stable regime starting around Period 24 while discounting earlier, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand spiked to 137 units, which is significantly higher than the established mean of ~76 units observed since Period 24. This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The most recent demand samples are: P40 (74), P41 (69), P42 (42), P43 (76), P44 (137). This spike at P44 suggests either a new upward regime shift similar to early in the game or a high-variance event. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the priority is avoiding another stockout. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stable baseline but also the weight of the recent spike, which raises the effective mean. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L at default.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 44: spike to 137 units follows a stable mean of ~76, causing a stockout. High volatility persists.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has been generally stable around a mean of ~76 units, however, recent periods (P44-P45) have shown a significant increase in both mean and volatility, with a spike to 137 units in P44 and 94 units in P45. The average demand over the last 22 periods (since the last major regime shift at P24) is approximately 78.4 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend targets a high service level (95%). To capture the recent volatility and the slight upward drift while maintaining stability, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, N=22 captures the entire current regime from P24 to P45 (mean ~78.4). For sigma_hat, N=22 also captures the broader volatility of this regime (StdDev ~19.5), which is necessary to prevent stockouts like the ones seen in P26, P27, P30, P33, and P44. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 24 (P24-P45) confirmed with mean ~78.4 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~19.5). Late-game spike in P44 (137) suggests ongoing risk of high-demand events.

The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by a mean of approximately 78 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~20-25). Period 44 saw a significant spike to 137, which reaffirms the need for a robust service level. Currently, on-hand inventory is 74 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering Period 24 to 46) to capture the current regime's behavior. This provides a stable mean while acknowledging the significant variance observed in this stretch, protecting against spikes like the one in P44 while minimizing holding costs for lower demand periods like P46 (39 units).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of 50. Analysis of the demand history reveals a stable, yet volatile, regime that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand has been approximately 78 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 20 units. Although there was a significant spike to 137 units in Period 44, subsequent periods (P45-P47) have returned to the expected range (94, 39, 82). The internal backend logic for 'recent_N' uses L+1, which in this case (L=0) means it calculates based on the average of the last N periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=24 to capture the entire current regime since Period 24, providing a stable estimate of both mean and variance. This strategy helps the OR engine calculate a 'base stock' that covers the high service level (95%) required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0). Since the game ends at Period 50, we have three more demand resolutions (P48, P49, P50). Our current on-hand inventory is 31 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Since Period 24, the demand regime has stabilized with a mean of approximately 78 units, though it exhibits significant volatility (peak 137 in P44). The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units. My objective is to satisfy demand for Period 49 and ideally Period 50, while acknowledging that any inventory left after Period 50's demand resolution will incur a holding cost without further profit opportunity. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the critical ratio for the base stock level is $0.95$. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=25 (covering P24-P48) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the recent spike in P44. For lead time, I am using 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1348.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 78.4 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 19.5). There was a major spike in Period 44 (137 units) and a significant dip in Period 46 (39 units), confirming that high variance persists. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio \u2248 0.95), the inventory policy should lean towards higher service levels to avoid the costly stockouts observed in periods like P44. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the regime starting at Period 24 (N=26) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while using a 0-period lead time.
