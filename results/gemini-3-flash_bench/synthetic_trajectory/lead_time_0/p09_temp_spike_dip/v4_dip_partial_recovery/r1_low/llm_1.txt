Historical data (Periods 1-5 of a previous sample or similar context) shows an average demand of approximately 99.6 units (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for demand in this same period. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is no in-transit stock, I need to place an order immediately to satisfy Period 1 demand. Given the historical average and an upward trend in the last two samples (106, 136), I will forecast a demand of approximately 100-110. To avoid lost sales while managing the $1.0 holding cost (which is equal to the profit per unit), I will order 120 units to provide a slight buffer for Period 1.",

Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2, I can rely on same-period arrivals. Period 3 historical demand is 65, but given the recent P2 spike and the stockout, I need to cover potential demand ranging from 65 to 130+ units to avoid further lost sales. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), I should be careful not to overstock significantly, but recovering from a stockout is priority.
