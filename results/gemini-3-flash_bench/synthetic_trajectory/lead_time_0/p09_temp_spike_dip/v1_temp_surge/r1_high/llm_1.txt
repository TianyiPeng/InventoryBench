  "rationale": "For Period 1, I have no historical arrival data to verify the promised lead time of 0 periods, so I must plan around the provided lead time while preparing for potential demand. Looking at historical demand for 'chips(Regular)', the samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106], which averages ~114 units per period with a standard deviation of ~15. Since lead time is promised as 0, an order placed now should arrive during the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase to satisfy Period 1's demand. To maximize total reward, I need to cover the expected demand for Period 1 plus a safety stock buffer to account for variance (aiming for ~140 units to cover ~114 avg + 1.7 std dev). Since current On-hand and In-transit are both 0, I will order 144 units to ensure high service level given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).",
