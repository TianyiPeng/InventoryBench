Based on the 5 historical demand samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the average demand is 114.4 units with a standard deviation of 15.3. Regular chips are a stable product, and without a specific calendar date, I will assume a standard demand regime. To maximize reward, I need to cover the demand for the current period (since lead time is 0, the order arrives before demand resolution). To be safe and maximize profit while accounting for potential demand spikes above the mean, I will target a stock level that covers the average plus one standard deviation (approx 130 units).",

Since actual lead time is confirmed as 0, I only need to cover the current period's demand (Period 2) while accounting for Period 1's actual demand being lower than the historical sample. However, the game history shows P1 demand was 46, whereas the 'Historical Demand Data' section listed P1 as 131. This suggests a potential regime shift or that historical samples are noisier than the actual run. To be safe and target an inventory level that covers a high demand realization (around 120-130), I currently have 84.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the current regime (P26-P49), averaging approximately 100 units per period (most recent 5-period average: 91; 10-period average: 101). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 4 units. To meet the expected demand of approximately 100-110 units while maintaining a small buffer for volatility (standard deviation ~20-25) and considering this is the final period (Period 50), I will order enough to cover typical high-range demand (approx 125 units) minus the current stock. Ordering 121 units will bring the total available for Period 50 to 125 units, which should satisfy most demand scenarios in this regime without excessive holding cost risk for a final period.",
