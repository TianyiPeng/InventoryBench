Since the promised lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive in the same period to satisfy Period 1 demand. To minimize the risk of a stockout in the first period and account for the initial demand spike (131 units in historical sample 1), I will target a slightly higher buffer.

However, Period 1 demand in the game history was 86, which is lower than the historical sample average but consistent with the general scale. Since lead time is 0, my order in Period 2 will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 2's demand immediately. I want to target an inventory level that covers Period 2's demand plus a small buffer, considering the relatively high holding cost ($1/unit).
