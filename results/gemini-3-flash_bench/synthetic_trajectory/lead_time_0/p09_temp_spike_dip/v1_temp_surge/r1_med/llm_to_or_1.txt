Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet, only pre-game demand samples. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods was 131, 92, 118, 125, and 106, resulting in a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. Since L=0, the relevant demand window for the OR engine's (L+1) calculation is just 1 period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the size of the available sample set) to set the initial mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, providing a stable baseline based on the provided history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 86 units, which is lower than the initial historical samples (mean ~114). The lead time was confirmed as 0 periods for the first order. Since the promised lead time is 0 and the first order arrived immediately, I will continue to use L=0. I will use the last 5 demand samples (including the most recent observation from Period 1) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the slightly higher historical mean with the lower recent realization (86). With L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0) = 1 period of demand. The OR engine will target a base stock to cover Period 2 demand based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, delivery was immediate (lead time 0). In Period 2, delivery was also immediate, but we experienced a stockout because demand (132) exceeded the starting on-hand plus arrival (120). Historical demand samples show values of 131, 92, 118, 125, 106, while observed demand in P1 was 86 and P2 was 132. The mean of the historical samples is 114.4. Given the stockout in P2 and the fact that lead time is consistently 0, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the historical mean. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time as '0' is confirmed, and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma choosing N=5 to capture the provided historical average and variance, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to cover the ~115 units expected this period plus a buffer for volatility.

Daily Profit: $400.00, Daily Holding Cost: $29.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 131, P2 was 92, P3 was 118, P4 was 125, and P5 was 106 (as per historical data provided). However, looking at the 'Period X conclude' logs, we see actual demand realizations: P1=86, P2=132 (stockout occurred), P3=100. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is 29 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since L=0, the formula for base stock is (1+L) * mu + z * sigma * sqrt(1+L). With L=0, we are effectively trying to cover the current period's demand. The average demand across P1-P3 is ~106. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu and sigma to capture the current variability, while keeping L at the default (0) as verified by historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 0, and all shipments from Periods 1 through 4 arrived in the same period they were ordered (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been somewhat volatile (86, 132, 100, 75) with an average of approximately 98.25. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (demand 132 vs starting inventory 120), indicating the need for a slightly more robust safety stock given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.8). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime while remaining responsive to the observed variance. For lead time (L), 'calculate' is appropriate as history confirms the promised lead time holds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of the first 5 periods, the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean. Specifically, demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106] (average: 114.4). Note: The game history 'demand' figures (86, 132, 100, 75, 106) provided in the conclude messages differ from the historical demand data list; I will prioritize the provided conclude message values as they reflect actual consumption. Those values are: P1:86, P2:132, P3:100, P4:75, P5:106. Mean = 99.8, Std Dev \u2248 22. Current on-hand is 14. To ensure high service levels while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters to capture the most relevant recent behavior (N=5). As lead time is 0, mu_hat effectively targets demand for one period (1+0).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history (Periods 1-6), the actual demand values were 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, and 77. The provided historical sample data (Periods 1-5: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggests a slightly higher mean (~114) than what has been observed in the first 6 periods of the game (~96). Specifically, the last three periods (Period 4-6) showed lower demand (75, 106, 77) with an average of ~86. However, the sample set is small and volatile. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 42 units with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the live game demand which is currently lower than the pre-game samples, ensuring we don't over-order and incur high holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the base-stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 out of 50. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 7 periods shows a mean of approximately 92 units (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67). There is no strong seasonal trend apparent yet, but volatility is moderate. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, we have 47 units on-hand. To optimize the order for Period 8, I will use all available historical demand samples (N=7) to calculate the base stock. The profit margin is $4/unit and the holding cost is $1/unit, resulting in a target service level of 0.8. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock formula should cover demand for the review period (current period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1. Analyzing the history (Periods 1-8), the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period). Demand has been somewhat volatile: [86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127]. The average demand over these 8 periods is approximately 96.25 units, with a standard deviation of about 23.8. In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (sold 111 with demand 127, ending inventory 0), indicating the need for a slightly higher base stock to buffer against spikes. Since lead time L=0, the backend formula for mu_hat is (1+L)*mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history of this demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to capture the observed volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods based on the history of Periods 1 through 9. Current inventory is low (7 units) following a demand of 110 units in Period 9. Analyzing the full history (Periods 1-9 plus the initial samples), the demand mean is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of about 19. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet, as demand oscillates between 67 and 132. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since 0 is stable. For demand parameters, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior patterns observed throughout the active game history, ensuring we cover the expected (L+1=1) period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of 10 periods, the demand is relatively stable but exhibits significant variance. The mean demand across all 10 periods is approximately 99 units (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110, 108). The last 3 periods (P8-P10) show a slightly higher demand stabilization (avg ~115) compared to the mid-period dip (P6-P7). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). Current inventory is low (10 units). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-day arrival and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand mean and volatility to capture the full distribution while placing slightly more weight on known samples over the prior. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the observed variance and maintains a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 11 periods shows a mean of approximately 101 units (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110, 108, 125). Although the provided historical seed data mentioned higher values (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the actual game history reflects more stability. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet. Inventory hit zero in periods 2, 8, and 11, indicating local stockouts due to high demand spikes (>125 units), though sales were limited by starting inventory. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the slightly higher demand observed in the last four periods (avg ~114) versus the lower mid-period demand. L is set to default (0). \u03bc\u0302 is set to default (which will use the mean of all samples) to maintain stability, but as the mean of all samples is ~101, I will rely on the OR backend's service level calculation (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) to handle the variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite orders arriving every period (lead time 0). In the last 12 periods, demand has frequently exceeded starting inventory (Periods 2, 8, 11, 12), leading to stockouts. Specifically, in Period 12, an order of 123 units arrived but demand was 132, leaving 9 units of unmet demand and 0 stock. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period conclude message). Historical demand mean for Periods 1-12 is 103.75, with a standard deviation of 22.4. However, demand in the last two periods was significantly higher (125, 132). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~120) and sigma_hat to reflect this recent elevated demand level and protect against stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift. The initial demand mean (Periods 1-7) was approximately 86.1, while the more recent demand mean (Periods 8-13) has risen to 119.0, with a peak of 132. Demand has consistently outstripped inventory in 3 of the last 6 periods, leading to lost sales. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better satisfy this higher demand regime and prevent lost sales given the low on-hand inventory of 18 units, I will shift to using the last 6 periods (the current high-demand regime) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the higher mean and reflects the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: average demand increased from ~86 to ~119 (+38%). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, moving from an average of ~86 to ~116 over the last 7 periods (Periods 8-14). Specifically, the demand values since Period 8 are: 127, 110, 108, 125, 132, 112, 98 (Average = 116). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 30 units in Period 14. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this new regime's mean and volatility for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher demand while accounting for the zero lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 8. Analyzing the demand from Period 8 to Period 15, the average demand is approximately 116 units per period (127, 110, 108, 125, 132, 112, 98, 114). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent sustained higher demand level while accounting for the inherent volatility (observed standard deviation in this regime is approx 11.4), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8, covering the entire new regime. Since L=0, mu_hat should target one period of demand (1+0=1), and on-hand inventory is currently low (13 units). Setting L to default (0) aligns with historical performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 195 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~119 observed since Period 8. This spike resulted in 0 ending inventory and lost sales, as the total available inventory (starting 126) was insufficient. While one data point is not a definitive regime shift, the magnitude of this jump (63% increase over the previous average) suggests a possible new demand level or a high-volatility event that requires immediate inventory buffer adjustment to avoid further stockouts. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the post-Period 8 increased demand and the most recent spike more heavily in the OR backend's base stock calculation. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed at Period 16 (195 units), compared to the previous regime average of ~119.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth or peak seasonal phase. After the regime shift at Period 8 (avg ~119), demand spiked to 195 in Period 16 and surged further to 251 in Period 17, resulting in back-to-back stockouts despite increasing orders. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 3 periods (Periods 15-17) to capture this surge. The mean for these periods is 186.7 (114, 195, 251), and the volatility is high. mu_hat needs to cover the current period and lead time (L=0, so 1+L=1 period). I will use explicit values to aggressively capture the upward trend and prevent further lost sales, setting mu_hat to 260 and sigma_hat to 60 to allow the OR backend to set a high base stock. Since stock is currently 0, the engine will order the full base stock capped by its logic.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge starting Period 16: demand increased from regime avg ~119 to 195 (P16) and 251 (P17), indicating a potential peak seasonal or trend shift.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has stabilized at Period 19 with 122 units on-hand after a significant demand surge that began in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16: 195, P17: 251, P18: 189) shows a substantial increase from the previous average of ~119. Calculating the mean for this new high-demand regime (Periods 16-18) gives approximately 211.67 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this high-demand state. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility (std deviation ~34.8), ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation accounts for potential stockout risks while keeping enough inventory to meet the new demand level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 16. Previous demand averaged ~119 units, but the last four periods (P16-P19) show a significantly higher average of 203 units (195, 251, 189, 177). This suggests a sustained seasonal or trend-based increase. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period history. Since we are in a high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new level of demand while ignoring the lower historical data. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that prioritizes meeting this higher demand given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg demand increased from ~119 to ~203 (+70%) based on P16-P19 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. After Period 8, demand increased to an average of ~119. However, starting Period 16, a significant surge occurred with demand values of 195, 251, 189, 177, and now 254 in Period 20. The current average demand for this most recent regime (P16-P20) is 213.2 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To capture this high-demand period while accounting for its increased variability, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on the five periods (P16-P20) of the current surge. The OR backend will use these values to set a base stock level that targets a high service level given the Profit($4)/Holding($1) ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand increased from ~119 to ~213 (+79%) based on P16-P20 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $946.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After Period 8, demand averaged ~119. At Period 16, a second, more aggressive shift occurred. Demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) has been 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, and 238, resulting in a mean of ~217 and a standard deviation of ~33. Currently, lead time is stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high stockout frequency in this new regime (ending inventory has hit 0 in multiple periods), I am using N=6 to capture the current high-demand average while providing enough volatility coverage (sigma_hat) to handle the spikes up to ~250 units. The base-stock model will calculate order quantities to meet this target level using a service level target based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand stabilized at ~217 (+82% from previous regime) based on P16-P21 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand was 250 units, continuing the high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the recent regime (Periods 16-22), demand values are [195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250]. The average of these 7 samples is 222 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 32.5. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 22 consecutive same-period arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. To capture the current high-demand level while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility, I will use a window of N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With L=0, the backend base stock becomes \u03bc + z*\u03c3. Profit=$4 and Holding=$1 results in a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). The parameters are set to protect against the high demand observed in this recent 7-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 has stabilized at an average of ~222 units (Periods 16-22), representing a significant increase over the previous regime.

Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23, the data points are: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184. This results in a mean demand of approximately 217 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 33.7. The lead time remains zero periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. With L=0, the target base stock (calculated as mu + z*sigma) will aim to cover the current period's demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate for this SKU.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 24, the values are: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184, 238. This yields a mean of approximately 219.56 units per period. The standard deviation across this same segment is approximately 32.5. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this stabilized higher demand regime (Periods 16-24), providing the OR backend with the most relevant current statistics to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained through Period 24 with an average of ~220 units and a standard deviation of ~33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from an average of ~119 units to a significantly higher mean. Examining demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (P16: 195, P17: 251, P18: 189, P19: 177, P20: 254, P21: 238, P22: 250, P23: 184, P24: 238, P25: 171), the average demand over these last 10 periods is 214.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 33.7. The lead time (L) is consistently observed to be 0 periods across the entire history. To respond to this stable but higher-demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 0, as confirmed by historical conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 remains stable through Period 25, with a 10-period average of ~215 units and standard deviation of ~34.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant drop in Period 26 (95 units) compared to the previous regime average of ~215 observed since Period 16. However, looking at the history, such fluctuations (like Period 23's 184 or Period 25's 171) have occurred within the high-demand regime, and Period 26 is the first instance of demand falling below 100 since the surge. It is premature to declare a regime down-shift based on one data point given the high variability (Period 16-26 mean: 204, std: 48). Carry-over insights confirm that the lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will maintain the L parameter at 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a window of recent_N = 11 (Period 16 to 26) to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and volatility while incorporating the recent low observation. This choice balances the risk of a potential downturn against the established high-demand pattern. The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a sustained high-demand period (averaging ~215 units from Periods 16-25), the last two periods (P26 and P27) have shown a sharp decline to 95 and 84 units respectively. This suggests the high-demand seasonal peak has ended, and demand is returning to a level closer to the Period 8-15 average (~119). Using a long-term average would over-order, while relying solely on the last two points is too risky. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to bridge the gap between the peak and the recent drop, acknowledging the downward trend while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: High-demand period (P16-P25 avg ~215) appears to have ended, with P26-P27 demand dropping to <100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (Period 16-25, avg ~220) has clearly ended. Demand for Period 26, 27, and 28 was 95, 84, and 121 respectively. This suggests a return to a lower demand level, likely similar to the Period 8-15 regime (avg ~119). Setting N=3 for mu_hat correctly captures the immediate shift by averaging the last three data points (100.0), which aligns with the observed drop. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current variability. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: High-demand peak (P16-P25) has ended. New regime (P26-P28) average demand is 100.0 units, a ~55% decrease from the previous peak.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (Period 16-25, ~215 units) has clearly ended. Demand from Period 26-29 has returned to levels consistent with the pre-spike average, with values of 95, 84, 121, and 98. The average of these last 4 periods is 99.5. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 29. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as arrivals consistently match the order period. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N where N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to lower demand while discarding the irrelevant high-demand peak data. This ensures the base stock level is appropriate for the current demand environment (~100 units/period) without carrying excessive inventory from previous high-volume periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current period (P31), I am analyzing the most recent regime (P26-P30). The demand values for these periods are 95, 84, 121, 98, and 117. This results in a mean of 103 and a standard deviation of approximately 15. The carry-over insights previously identified this shift, and the last 5 periods of data confirm the stabilization of this lower regime compared to the peak. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical conclude messages. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is stable through Period 30, with a 5-period average of 103 units and standard deviation of ~15, confirming the end of the high-demand peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new lower-demand regime starting at Period 26. The high-demand peak (P16-P25) which averaged ~215 units has clearly ended. The current regime (P26-P31) shows an average demand of approximately 103.6 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107) with a standard deviation of about 14.5. I am setting the forecast variables mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this specific stability. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (10 units), and there is no pipeline inventory, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on this current lower-demand regime (~104 units) and order enough to reach that level, minus current stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand values are: 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, and 112. This yields a 7-period average (recent_N=7) of 104.8 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. Moving away from the high-demand peak (P16-P25) which averaged ~215, the current regime is much closer to the initial baseline (P1-P15 avg ~105). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized post-peak behavior, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current average demand of approx 105 units per period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the high-demand peak that ended at Period 25. Since Period 26, the demand has been consistently lower, with an average of 104.5 units over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) and a standard deviation of approximately 13.5. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in history. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this stable post-peak regime while ignoring the previous surge data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current lower demand level, balancing the service level against holding costs for the remains of the game.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 26, dropping from the high-demand peak (avg ~215) back to a level consistent with the earlier regime. From Period 26 to Period 34 (9 samples), the average demand is 100.8 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. The current period (Period 35) shows no evidence of a further regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history. I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and use a 'recent_N' of 9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable regime while excluding the previous high-demand peak. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~101 units with a safety buffer based on the recent volatility of ~14.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable, following the end of the high-demand peak (P16-P25). For Periods 26 through 35, the average demand is approximately 104.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. The most recent demand (Period 35) was 122 units, slightly above the average but within a reasonable range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use the recent 10 periods (P26-P35) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this post-peak stability accurately while ignoring the outlier period 16-25 peak. This ensures we don't overstock based on old high-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 remains stable through Period 35 with a 10-period average of ~104 units and standard deviation of ~15.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime that began at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (Periods 16-25). Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the average demand is approximately 103.5 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To maintain the target service level given the current stability, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this post-peak regime accurately. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a stable regime that began at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is 98.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The most recent demand (P37) was significantly lower at 55 units, but there is not yet enough evidence to classify this as a new regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime and prevent over-stocking during this lower-demand phase, I will use a recent_N window of 12 periods (P26-P37) for both demand mean and volatility. This balances the stable 100-ish average with the recent lower observation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current Period 39, I analyze the most recent regime (P26-P38) which shows an average demand of approximately 101.8 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, an order needs to be placed to cover the upcoming demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=13 (covering the period from P26 to P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this post-peak regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in the last two periods (P37 demand was 55, P38 was 132). Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate given the consistent 0-period lead time history.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 98.7 units (periods 26-39). The most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) show a mean of 100.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the consistent behavior since the high-demand peak ended, I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 (P26-P39) to set parameters, as this captures the entire current regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with the most recent order (P39) arriving in the same period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a stable regime that started at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (Periods 16-25). Over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of about 21.6. Although there was a slight uptick in demand in the last period (P40 demand = 136), it remains within a reasonable range for this regime. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to use recent statistics (N=15) to set the demand parameters, allowing the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the post-peak behavior clearly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a slight uptick starting from Period 40 (136 units) and Period 41 (142 units), compared to the stable regime average of ~104 observed between Periods 26 and 39. While the long-term regime desde Period 26 has been stable around ~104, the last two periods suggest a possible shift or increased volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. To account for the recent increase while respecting the established regime, I will use recent_N with N=15 (covering P27 to P41) to capture the base demand while being influenced by the latest spikes. Setting L=0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially increasing or becoming more volatile after Period 39: P40-P41 average is 139 versus P26-P39 average of ~101.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a potential regime shift starting around Period 40. While Periods 26-39 averaged approximately 101 units, demand spiked to 136 (P40) and 142 (P41) before dipping to 79 in P42. The average of the most recent three periods (P40-P42) is ~119 units, which is a 17.8% increase over the previous stable mean. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we should lean toward covering the higher end of demand volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrival same period). I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in volatility and mean while avoiding over-indexing on the single low data point in P42.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 40: average increased from ~101 (P26-P39) to ~119 (P40-P42) with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev increased from ~15 to ~35).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift starting at Period 40. Analysis of Periods 40-43 shows an average demand of 119.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.2, compared to the Period 26-39 average of ~102. This indicates both higher mean demand and increased volatility as we approach the end of the simulation. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this new higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to the increased variance (to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 40 and 41), I am using a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture the current trend (Periods 40, 41, 42, 43). This will set the base stock based on the most relevant recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~102 to ~120 (+18%) with increased volatility (Std Dev ~30) observed through Period 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified at Period 40. While the most recent demand in Period 44 was low (65 units), the average demand since Period 40 is approximately 108.8 units (136, 142, 79, 122, 65), which is higher and significantly more volatile compared to the stable Period 26-39 regime (avg ~102, std dev ~15). The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 79 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent increase in volatility and shift in mean demand, while setting L to default (0). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent uncertainty and maintains a sufficient service level for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 40. Analysis of Periods 40-45 shows a mean demand of approximately 105.8 units with a standard deviation of 31.4. While Period 44 saw a dip (65) and Period 45 was also below the previous estimate (91), the volatility remains higher than the P26-P39 period. The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 44 suggested an average of ~120, but the two most recent data points (65, 91) suggest the increase might be less than initially feared or simply highly volatile. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=6 to cover the entire shift from Period 40 to capture the current mean and the elevated volatility (sigma). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher uncertainty seen since Period 40 while adjusting for the lower volume in the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 40. While the previous regime (P26-P39) had an average demand of ~102, the current regime (P40-P46) shows higher volatility and a slightly higher average. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P40-P46) have demands of 136, 142, 79, 122, 65, 91, 126, resulting in a mean of ~108.7 and a standard deviation of ~30. This confirms the 'Period 44' carry-over insight of increased volatility (Std Dev ~30). Lead time remains 0. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (80%), so I will use a recent window (N=7) to capture this increased volatility while maintaining a lean base stock, ensuring we cover the higher demand spikes seen in P40, P41, and P46.

chips(Regular): ordered=128, arrived=128 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=135, demand=82, sold=82, ending on-hand inventory=53
Daily Profit: $328.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 40, characterized by an average demand of approximately 105-110 units but with significantly higher volatility compared to the P26-P39 stable period. Since Period 40, demands have been: 136, 142, 79, 122, 65, 91, 126, 82. The mean of these 8 periods is 105.4 with a standard deviation of ~29.5. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this specific regime's behavior. Given there are only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), I want to ensure enough stock to satisfy potential high-demand draws in this volatile regime while starting to wind down inventory towards the end of the simulation.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 40, exhibiting higher volatility compared to the P26-P39 period. Since Period 40, demand values have been 136, 142, 79, 122, 65, 91, 126, 82, and 67. The last 9 periods (P40-P48) show an average demand of approximately 101 units, but with significantly higher variance than the previous stable period. Although the recent few days suggest a downward trend (82, 67), I will use N=9 to capture the full volatility of this current regime starting at P40. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Parameters are set to manage this volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 40. While there was an initial increase in volatility and mean (confirmed in carry-over insights), the recent 10 periods (P40-P49) show a mean demand of approximately 102.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5 (P40: 136, P41: 142, P42: 79, P43: 122, P44: 65, P45: 91, P46: 126, P47: 82, P48: 67, P49: 110). This indicates that the demand has reverted slightly from the initial spike but remains more volatile than the P26-P39 regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for this stabilized but volatile demand, I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics (P40-P49). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 40 has stabilized over 10 periods (P40-P49) at an average of ~102 units with increased volatility (Std Dev ~28) compared to the prior regime.
