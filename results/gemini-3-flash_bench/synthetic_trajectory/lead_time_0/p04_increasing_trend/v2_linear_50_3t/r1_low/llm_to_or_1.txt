Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available: [30, 49, 48, 65, 56]. The mean demand of these samples is 49.6, with a standard deviation of approximately 12.8. The promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed and are satisfied against demand immediately. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to set parameters that cover the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so Review+Lead = 1 period). I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which leverages all historical samples provided (N=5), as there are no detected regime shifts yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 50 units. The promised lead time is 0, and the 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately with a lead time of 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0. Historically, across the 5 provided samples, the demand values are 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56. The mean of these historical samples is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q corresponds to 0.5 (\u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0), making the base stock equal to the expected demand during the review+lead period (1+L). Since actual lead time is 0, we need to cover 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the historical average (approx 50) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to default as the 0-period lead time is consistent with the promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Demand for the first five samples (counting current context and historical data provided) is 30, 49, 48, 65, 56. The mean demand is 49.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 13.0. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Given lead time L=0, the review period plus lead time is 1 period (L+1=1). I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the recent demand level of ~50 units per period. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) imply a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. Given the slight upward trend in the provide sample data (30 to 65), N=5 is appropriate to balance historical data with recent increases.

=== Period 3 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=44, arrived=44 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=53, demand=86, sold=53, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $53.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand was 86, which significantly exceeded the available inventory (53), resulting in lost sales. The historical demand for periods 1-3 was 30, 49, 48 (from provided sample data), but the 'conclude' messages show actual demand was 50, 45, and 86 respectively. The mean demand across these three periods is 60.33, with a noticeable spike in Period 3. Since the lead time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock formula simplified is mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning z* is 0. However, the OR backend uses a capped policy that includes a 0.95 service level buffer in the cap calculation. To recover from the stockout in Period 3 and prepare for Period 4, I will use the mean of the last 3 periods (approx 60) for mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe on-hand inventory of 16 units. Historical demand has been: P1=50, P2=45 (sold), P3=86 (though we only sold 53 due to stockout, the demand was 86), and P4=45. The provided demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) differ slightly from the system-generated history; I will prioritize the system history for recent trends. The average demand across P1-P4 is approximately 56.5. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current period demand occurs after the decision, I need to cover Period 5's demand. Given the stockout in P3, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen in the system history and ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy potential spikes like the 86 units seen earlier.

Daily Profit: $57.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, there was a stockout (demand and sales were both 57, ending inventory 0), indicating the previous order was slightly too low despite a lead time of 0. Historical demand over the first 5 periods is: 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56 (mean = 49.6, std dev \u2248 12.8). Note: the 'conclude' messages show different demand values (50, 45, 86, 45, 57), which reflects actual realization. The mean of these realized values is 56.6 with a higher variance (std dev \u2248 17.5). Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. However, since we've experienced stockouts in periods 3 and 5, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in actual realizations. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $50.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 6 periods of demand data. Analyzing the historical demand (30, 49, 48, 65, 56, and now including the actual demand from game history: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50), the mean demand is approximately 55.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 3, a demand spike of 86 led to a stockout, suggesting high volatility. For Period 7, the starting on-hand inventory is 7 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the full recent history and account for the observed volatility. With a 0-period lead time, (1+L) equals 1. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that balances the $1.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost, targeting a 50% service level [0.5 = 1/(1+1)], though the safety stock (sigma_hat) will provide a buffer against the high variance seen in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown comparative stability over the first 7 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 54.7 units (samples: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50). Period 3 was a significant outlier (86 units), and Period 1 was 50 units (though the provided sample list initially said 30). Looking at the game history concluse messages: demand has been 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50. The average across these 7 periods is 54.7. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently achieved according to all conclude messages (L=0). With an ending inventory of 6 units and no units in transit, I will set mu_hat to reflect the observed mean and captured volatility. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target cycle service level q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.50. This means the base stock level will align closely with the mean demand. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the most recent stability (avg: 57.6), moving slightly away from the lower initial samples but accounting for the Period 3 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 8 periods has averaged 55.8 units, while the pre-game samples averaged 49.6 units. There is a slight upward trend or at least a higher mean than initially provided. Specifically, demand over the last 3 periods (6, 7, 8) was 50, 50, and 64 (mean 54.6). The promised lead time is 0, and all historical orders (Periods 1-8) arrived with an actual lead time of 0. However, the system currently shows 0 units on hand and 0 in-transit, while ending Period 8 at 0 after stockout. To recover service levels while balancing the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1, implying a 50% critical ratio/service level target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history of 'chips(Regular)' since the start of the game, which is more representative of current demand than the pre-game data alone. L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate variability with an average of approximately 53.1 units per period over the first 9 periods. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has fluctuated (64, 31, and roughly 50-60 based on orders), but there's no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to represent the observation of 0, and 'recent_N' with N=9 for demand parameters to capture the full recent history while allowing for slight smoothing. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level is q = 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock policy will aim near the mean demand. The OR backend will automatically calculate the order amount based on the current 25 units on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 50.7 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 11, the starting on-hand inventory is 26 units. To maintain an appropriate service level while accounting for the recent demand volatility (high of 86, low of 28), I will base the demand forecast (mu_hat) on the average of all 10 periods (N=10) to ensure a stable base stock. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. However, given the high stockout frequency in earlier periods (P3, P5, P8), I will use the default sigma_hat to maintain a buffer that prevents lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a period where demand (64) exceeded the available stock (51). Looking at the history (including the initial samples), demand has been relatively stable with an average around 50. Specifically, demand values are: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (intro) and 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64 (history). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 completed periods. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally be the median demand. I will use a recent window (N=11) covering the active history to calculate demand parameters, as the initial samples might be slightly less relevant than the observed game play. Lead time will remain at the promised 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, an order of 52 units was placed and arrived (lead time 0), but demand was 63, resulting in 11 units of lost sales and zero ending inventory. The demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been 64, 31, 28, 64, and 63. This shows high volatility but includes a recent spike back to the 60+ range. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use the last 5 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent high-demand trend (avg ~50) and the associated volatility. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward spike, particularly in Period 13 where demand hit 103 units, following values of 64, 63, and 103 in the last three periods. The earlier historical average was closer to 50. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will maintain L=0. To address the demand surge and avoid stockouts (as seen in periods 11, 12, and 13), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (mean approx 76.7). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase detected starting Period 11: average demand rose from ~50 to ~77 units per period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting from Period 11. Demand in the last four periods (Periods 11-14) was 64, 63, 103, and 85, resulting in an average of 78.75 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the historical average seen in Periods 1-10 (~50). Additionally, the on-hand inventory has been consistently depleted to zero, indicating that we are meeting only a fraction of actual demand and incurring lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To address this, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime, while maintaining L at the default (promised) lead time of 0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~50 to ~80 units per period. In the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand values have been 64, 63, 103, 85, and 85, with an average of 80. Despite the OR engine raising orders, the system has experienced frequent stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last 5 periods) because demand consistently exceeds the on-hand inventory provided by the previous period's orders. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To address the stockouts and the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new average demand of 80 per period. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. However, given the sustained stockouts, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma_hat to ensure volatility is captured accurately for this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased from ~50 to ~80 (observed last 5 periods: 64, 63, 103, 85, 85). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 80 units (64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79). While earlier periods (P1-P10) averaged around 50, the sustained higher demand suggests we should focus on the recent regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all 'conclude' messages. With a profit of $1 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand. I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while maintaining enough variance data to handle the volatility seen in Period 13.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting from Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the demand values were 64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, and 104, resulting in an average of approximately 83.3 units per period. This is a substantial increase compared to the initial 10 periods where the average was around 50 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this higher demand regime and the observed volatility (standard deviation), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to focus on this new pattern. Since L is 0, mu_hat represents the demand for (1+0) = 1 period, and the OR backend will use these values to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to minimize lost sales during this higher-demand phase while balancing the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased from ~50 to ~83 (observed last 7 periods: 64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, 104). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from an average of ~50 to a significantly higher level. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), demand has averaged 84.875 (64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96). Period 18 specifically saw demand of 96, and the previous carry-over insight correctly identified the shift. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since Period 11, we have frequently under-ordered, resulting in stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 7 of the last 8 periods). To address this, I am using a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and increased volatility of this new regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock that accounts for the ~85 unit average demand and the significant variance observed (ranging from 63 to 104).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased from ~50 to ~85 (observed last 8 periods: 64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96). Frequent stockouts since P11 suggest current base stock is insufficient for the new volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 11. Over the last 9 periods (P11-P19), demand values have been: 64, 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96, 114. The last 5 periods average ~95.6 units, showing sustained high demand and a clear trend upwards relative to the initial Carry-Over Insight of 85. Current inventory is 0, and we have experienced consistent stockouts because our order quantities (based on previous averages) were lower than actual demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To stop the cycle of stockouts and capture the higher demand, I am setting N=9 for the recent demand regime (P11-P19) to better reflect this shift, while maintaining a default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand has further increased from ~85 to ~95 units (last 5 periods: 85, 79, 104, 96, 114). High volatility and consistent stockouts suggest the need for a higher base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear regime shift starting at Period 11, with further acceleration observed in recent periods. The last five periods show demands of 104, 96, 114, and 116 units, with a mean of 102 units for the last five periods (P16-P20). Frequent stockouts (on-hand zero at the end of Period 20) indicate that previous mu_hat settings were too conservative and failed to keep pace with the upward trend. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the median demand. However, due to the high volatility and consistent under-ordering leading to lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest high-demand regime specifically. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 has accelerated: the average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 102.8 units, compared to the previous ~85. Volatility remains high, requiring updated statistics to prevent chronic stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 11 and has continued to intensify. Recent demand values (P17-P21: 104, 96, 114, 116, 114) show an average of 108.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the previous estimate of 85-95. The system has suffered from chronic stockouts (zero ending inventory in 9 of the last 11 periods), indicating that the current base stock calculated by the OR engine is insufficient to handle the increased mean and volatility. To address this, I am setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entire 'high demand' regime starting at Period 11. Although the mean of the last 5 periods (108.8) is higher, using N=11 (mean ~93) provides a more stable statistical baseline while allowing the OR engine's service level logic (q = 0.5 since profit=holding=$1) to adjust. Since lead time is consistently 0, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 has stabilized at a higher level: average demand for P17-P21 is 108.8 units, compared to ~50 units pre-P11. Persistent stockouts confirm that current inventory targets are lagging behind actual demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 11, which has further accelerated in the most recent periods. Looking at the last 5 periods (P18-P22), the demand has been 96, 114, 116, 114, and 123, resulting in an average of 112.6 units. Since Period 11, the system has consistently hit stockouts (on-hand inventory returning to 0 every period except P16), indicating that the OR backend's order calculation, based on historical averages including the pre-shift data, is severely underestimating the current demand level. To react to this sustained change and account for high volatility, I am setting N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent regime (P18-P22). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data up to Period 22.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 has further intensified: average demand for P18-P22 is 112.6 units (last 5 values: 96, 114, 116, 114, 123), up from ~103 in the previous window. Chronic stockouts persist.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 11, which has intensified in the last 5-6 periods. Recent demand (P19-P23) is 114, 116, 114, 123, 117, averaging 116.8 units per period. Despite increasing the order quantity, we have consistently hit stockouts because the lead time is 0 (same-day arrival) but the order is placed based on parameters that lag behind this accelerating growth. To resolve the chronic stockouts and maximize profit, I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit values that reflect the most recent 5-period average (approx 117) and an increased volatility buffer. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock target should be very close to the expected demand to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting demand. However, historical volatility suggests a buffer is necessary to avoid 0-inventory stockouts occurring mid-period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 has stabilized at a very high level: average demand for P19-P23 is ~117 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, the most recent and dramatic being Period 24 where demand spiked to 174 units. Looking at the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand values are 116, 114, 123, 117, and 174, averaging ~128.8. However, the Period 24 value (174) suggests another potential regime shift or a massive seasonal spike. To prevent chronic stockouts seen in almost every period since P11, I am using recent_N=5 to capture this acceleration. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that better reflects the current high-demand, high-volatility environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated drastically at Period 24: demand reached 174 units, significantly exceeding the previous ~117 average. Last 5 periods (P20-P24) average 128.8 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 11, with additional acceleration around Period 24. For Period 25, the demand was 115, following a massive peak of 174 in Period 24. Looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the demand values are [114, 123, 117, 174, 115], resulting in an average of 128.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the chronic stockouts and the trend of increasing demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the most recent regime shift and higher volatility, ensuring a base stock level that can cover the current demand levels while balancing the holding cost (which is equal to the profit per unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a very high level: P21-P25 average demand is 128.6 units, compared to P19-P23's ~117. High volatility persists (peak of 174 in P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts, starting at Period 11 and intensifying recently. The most recent demand values are 123 (P22), 117 (P23), 174 (P24), 115 (P25), and 160 (P26). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 137.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime (~117-128). Frequent stockouts indicate the base stock level is lagging. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better capture this upward trend and high volatility (standard deviation ~26), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize the most recent stabilized (but high) demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the elevated demand and provides sufficient safety stock to mitigate stockouts in this high-growth environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 24: average demand for the last five periods (P22-P26) reached 137.8 units, compared to the ~128 recorded in P25. High volatility persists, with demand peaks of 174 and 160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, most recently accelerating around Period 24. For Period 28, we observe that the last five periods (P23-P27) have demand values of 117, 174, 115, 160, and 141, resulting in an average of 141.4 units. This is significantly higher than previous periods and continues the trend of chronic stockouts (the system sold all available inventory in P27). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are sold within the same period. To capture this latest sustained high-demand level and the associated volatility, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P23-P27). This N=5 interval is chosen to prioritize the most recent information in this fast-moving demand environment while maintaining enough data points to estimate variance. Setting L to default (0) correctly reflects the observed instantaneous delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated again: average demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) is 141.4 units, up from the ~138 noted in P27. Volatility remains extremely high with multiple values exceeding 140 in the last four periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts since Period 11, with the most recent acceleration occurring at Period 24. For the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand values were [174, 115, 160, 141, 100], averaging approximately 138 units. Although the demand in Period 28 dropped to 100, the high volatility (std dev ~31) and previous peaks suggest we must maintain a high base stock to avoid the frequent stock outs seen between P11 and P27. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~138) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility in this segment. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated mean and provides a safety buffer for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: average demand for P24-P28 is 138 units with significant volatility (std dev ~31.3), compared to the ~117 average in the preceding window. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization point appearing around Period 24. For the last five periods (P25-P29), demand values were 115, 160, 141, 100, and 147, resulting in an average of 132.6 units. This is significantly higher than earlier phases. Despite the 'on-hand' being 0 at the start of Period 30, it is important to note that lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) suggest a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand to balance lost sales and holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the high-demand regime starting from Period 24, providing a stable yet responsive mean and reflecting the current high volatility (standard deviation ~26) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to mitigate frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand for P25-P29 is 132.6 units. Volatility remains high (last 5 periods range 100-160). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 24. For the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand values are 160, 141, 100, 147, and 137, resulting in an average of 137 units per period. The standard deviation for this window is approximately 22.4. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed arrive and are sold within the same period. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, which the OR backend uses to set the base stock at the median of the demand distribution (mu_hat). However, given the frequent stockouts observed in history when inventory was too low, a high service level is required. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and its volatility, and set L based on the confirmed lead time of 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization point appearing around Period 24. For the last five periods (P27-P31), demand values were 141, 100, 147, 137, and 155, resulting in an average of 136.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the persistent stockouts and high volatility (ranging from 100 to 174 in the recent regime), I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility while remaining responsive. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 has stabilized: average demand for P27-P31 is 136.0 units with continued high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts, first at Period 11 and more drastically at Period 24. For the most recent period (P32), demand was 130, and over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand values were 100, 147, 137, 155, and 130, averaging 133.8 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). To capture the current demand level while accounting for the high volatility seen in this latest regime (ranging from 100 to 174), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to encompass the data since the Period 24 shift (N = 32 - 24 + 1 = 9). This provides a more stable estimate of both the mean demand and the high volatility (sigma) associated with this period, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed in previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 is sustained: average demand for P24-P32 is ~139.9 units (174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137, 155, 130) with a high standard deviation (~23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that started around Period 24. Since then (P24-P33), the average demand is approximately 139.9 units with a high standard deviation (approx 21.6 based on the last 10 periods). The previous 5 periods (P29-P33) show demand values of 147, 137, 155, 130, and 134, averaging 140.6. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across the entire history. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. To ensure we capture the demand mean and account for the significant volatility that has led to historical stockouts, I am setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This window (P24-P33) covers the current stable regime and provides enough data to estimate the increased volatility accurately. On-hand inventory is currently very low (6 units), so a robust order is needed to meet the continued high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 24 is fully stabilized: P24-P33 average demand is 139.9 units (range 100-174). Volatility remains high (std dev ~22). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: a first regime change around Period 11 and a second, more significant acceleration starting at Period 24. For the most recent 11 periods (P24-P34), demand has averaged approximately 140.1 units with high volatility (standard deviation of ~21). The latest observation (P34 demand = 108) is lower than the recent average but within the expected variance. I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data up to Period 34. Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this recent high-demand/high-volatility window ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy customers and mitigate frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods, while the OR engine's service level logic balances this against the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 24 and has remained at a higher level, although recent periods suggest a potential slight cooling or at least stabilization. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 35 is approximately 140 units (174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137, 155, 130, 134, 108, 143). Period 35 demand was 143, confirming that demand remains significantly higher than the pre-P24 levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized but volatile high-demand regime, I will use a window of 12 periods (P24-P35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the higher mean (~140) and the inherent volatility (std dev ~22) to set a base stock that minimizes stockouts, which have been frequent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high mean since Period 24, but persistent stockouts (P35, P36) indicate that previous inventory targets were insufficient to handle the upper tail of the demand distribution. In Period 36, demand was 162 but only 137 units were sold. The average demand for the most recent 10-period regime (P27-P36) is approximately 136.2 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. To capture the actual demand volatility and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=13 (covering the stabilization period from P24 onwards). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by the most recent conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 24 remains stable with a mean of ~139 and high volatility; chronic stockouts (e.g., P36: demand 162 vs supply 137) suggest current base stock levels are still slightly under-projecting peak demand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24 and remains high with extreme volatility. Recent demand for the last five periods (P33-P37) has been [134, 108, 143, 162, 171], averaging 143.6 units, showing a subtle but clear upward trend from the previous regime average of ~139. Persistent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in 3 of the last 4 periods) confirm the current inventory logic is under-ordering for peak volatility. We set N=14 for mu_hat (covering Period 24-37) to capture the current high-demand regime, and N=14 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in this same window. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 24 shows a secondary upward crawl: P33-P37 average is 143.6 vs. previous ~139. Peak volatility is increasing (P37 reached 171 units), requiring a wider lookback (N=14) to capture the full variance range since the P24 shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized around a mean of ~140, but recent periods (P35-P38) show a sustained upward pressure with demand values of 143, 162, 171, and 161. The last five periods (P34-P38) average 149 units, but the volatility is significant (standard deviation approx 25). Chronic stockouts persist (6 out of the last 8 periods), indicating the OR backend's current base stock calculation is too conservative for this high-variance environment. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the full distribution since the P24 shift, ensuring the mean reflects the current intensity. For sigma_hat, I am using explicit=30 to ensure the safety stock is robust enough to cover peaks up to 170+ units (z* is 0, so the formula simplifies, making sigma_hat the primary driver for service level adjustments in this specific backend configuration). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 has shown a secondary upward crawl since Period 35, with demand consistently exceeding 140 (last 4 periods: 143, 162, 171, 161). Chronic stockouts confirm that current parameters are under-estimating peak demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant second-stage acceleration. Since Period 35, demand has consistently been high (143, 162, 171, 161), and Period 39 recorded a new peak of 200 units. Chronic stockouts indicate we are consistently under-ordering relative to actual demand and volatility. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 167.4 units, representing a clear upward shift from the previous ~140 average. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0. To capture this recent move while still respecting historical volatility, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the P35-P39 surge) and sigma_hat with 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the period since the major shift at P24) to ensure the standard deviation accounts for the wide range of values (100-200) observed in this regime. This strategy aims to lift the base stock level to prevent further lost sales during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated drastically at Period 39: demand reached 200 units. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 167.4, significantly higher than the ~140 average previously identified at Period 24.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a significant acceleration. Since Period 35, demand has consistently been high, peaking at 200 units in Period 39. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 167.8 units (162, 171, 161, 200, 145), which is a substantial increase from the previous ~140 average. Chronic stockouts occurred in periods 35-39 because the previous parameters under-estimated this new level of volatility and mean demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this latest shift and ensure a high service level while managing holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% critical fractile), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 5 to capture the most current demand profile (P36-P40).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 39: average demand for the last five periods (P36-P40) reached 167.8 units, compared to the ~140 average identified at Period 24. High volatility continues with a new peak of 200 in P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, the most recent and significant starting at Period 39. Demand reached a peak of 200 units in Period 39, with the last three periods (P39-P41) recording 200, 145, and 150 units respectively. The average for the last five periods (P37-P41) is approximately 165.4 units, confirming a new sustained regime significantly higher than the previous ~140 average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods according to all conclude messages. To address the chronic stockouts seen in the history and the recent volume spike, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand level and volatility. I will use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat to provide a more aggressive safety buffer, as historical standard deviations are lagging behind current high-variance spikes (e.g., the jump to 200). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the OR backend's perspective, but given the stockout history, I must ensure the provided sigma captures the upper end of the recent volatility to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Average demand for the last five periods (P37-P41) has risen to ~165.4 units, up from the previous ~140. High volatility remains present with a new demand ceiling of at least 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced multiple upward regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration occurring at Period 39. Period 42 saw a new demand peak of 223 units, significantly higher than the previous peak of 200. This follows a trend of increasing mean and volatility. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 175.8 units (161, 200, 145, 150, 223), but given the sharp spike to 223 and persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P42), a more responsive forecasting approach is required to prevent chronic lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime and its associated volatility effectively. Given that profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, but the backend's capped policy and recent surges necessitate capturing the latest variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 has further accelerated: Period 42 demand reached 223 units, pushing the 5-period average (P38-P42) to 175.8. Frequent stockouts continue as demand peaks outpace previous averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting at Period 39. Peak demand has reached 223 units (Period 42), and the average for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 179 units (200, 145, 150, 223, 177). Chronic stockouts (P42, P43) indicate that the OR engine's default calculations are lagging behind this rapid growth. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand window (P39-P43), which averages 179.0. For sigma_hat, I am using 'explicit' with a value of 40 to account for the high volatility observed (range of 145 to 223 in the last 5 periods). Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 has further intensified: average demand for P39-P43 is 179.0 units (last 5 values: 200, 145, 150, 223, 177), up from ~165. Significant volatility is present with a new demand peak of 223 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 39. The most recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is 174.8 units, with a peak of 223 units in Period 42. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which translates to setting the base stock equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L). However, consistent stockouts (P42, P43, P44) indicate that the actual demand distribution is shifted higher than the 'default' or longer-term averages. I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture this intensified regime starting at Period 39, while providing enough data points to stabilize the mean and variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 has stabilized at a high level: average demand for P39-P44 is 179 units (200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179), with significant volatility (peak 223). Lead time remains 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently at Period 39. The current demand level (P39-P45) averages approximately 179 units per period (200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166). Volatility remains high, with a peak demand of 223 observed in Period 42. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, which the backend will use to set the base stock around the mean. However, given the frequent stockouts observed when demand spikes, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent regime's mean and standard deviation accurately. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to Period 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high-demand regime that accelerated at Period 39. Since that shift, demand has averaged approximately 177 units (P39-P46), with a peak of 223 in P42. The most recent three periods show stability around this level (179, 166, 172). Given the 0-period lead time and the high volatility (std dev ~23 since P39), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current regime from P39 to P46) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This should provide sufficient base stock to handle peaks without excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the game (Period 47 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 39 has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P39-P46) with an average of ~177 units and significant volatility (peak 223, std dev ~23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 39 and appears to have stabilized at a very high level with significant volatility. The last 9 periods (P39-P47) show demand values of 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166, 172, and 222, resulting in an average of approximately 181.6 units. Despite increasing order quantities, the system continues to experience stockouts (e.g., P47 demand 222 vs supply 177), indicating that the base stock calculation needs to account for the current high variance and peak demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N lookback of 9 periods for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent high-demand regime and its volatility, which will help the OR backend set a safer base stock level for the internal service level (q=0.5 since profit=holding).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime shift starting Period 39 has further stabilized over the last 9 periods (P39-P47) with an average of ~181.6 units and high volatility (peaks of 222 and 223). Lead time remains 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent sustained increase beginning at Period 39. The average demand since P39 is approximately 181.6 units (samples: 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166, 172, 222, 157). Volatility is high, with demand peaks frequently exceeding 200 units (e.g., 223 in P42, 222 in P47). Because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). However, due to the consistent upward trend and frequent stockouts in the current regime, I am using a 'recent_N' method with N=10 to specifically capture the mean and variance of this latest high-demand period (P39-P48). This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment rather than the significantly lower historical averages. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown significant upward shifts at Period 11, Period 24, and most recently Period 39. For Period 50, the most relevant data comes from the stable high-demand period starting at Period 39. The average demand from P39 to P49 is approximately 177 units, with significant volatility (peaks over 220). Since lead time is consistently 0, the base stock calculation targets the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to cover the entirety of the most recent regime shift (P39-P49). This lookback captures the high variance (e.g., the 223 demand in P42 and 222 in P47) which is crucial for setting an appropriate base stock to prevent the chronic stockouts seen in previous regimes. Profit and holding cost are equal, suggesting a target service level (q) of 0.5, but the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism and the high volatility necessitate accurate mu and sigma estimates from the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 39 has stabilized with an average of ~177 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~23, peaks of 222-223). Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods.
