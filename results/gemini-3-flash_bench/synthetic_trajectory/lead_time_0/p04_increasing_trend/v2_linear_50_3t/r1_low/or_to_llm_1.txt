OR Recommendation: The OR algorithm suggests 39 units. Let's evaluate: \u03bc\u0302 (1+L) = 50 * 1 = 50. With profit $1 and holding cost $1, the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the safety factor z* is 0. The OR base-stock level would be around 50. Since we have 10 on-hand, 50 - 10 = 40. The OR recommendation of 39 is very close to this. 5. Strategy: Demand is relatively stable around 50. Given L=0, we need to cover only the current period's demand. I will order 45 units to target a total availability of 55 (10 on-hand + 45 new), which provides a small buffer over the average demand of 50 without incurring excessive holding costs, as the holding cost is high ($1.0/unit, equal to the profit).",

There is a clear softening in recent demand (averaging ~29.5 over the last two periods), whereas the initial periods were much higher. 3. OR Recommendation Review: The OR baseline suggests 24 units. With L=0, the target stock cover is for 1 period. If demand remains in the recent 'low' regime (~30), the 27 units on-hand plus the OR's 24 units provides a total of 51 units, which is quite safe.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is 53 units. In Period 49, the demand was 157 and 157 units arrived (ordered in P49 with lead time 0), resulting in an ending inventory of 53. Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy the final period's demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs, as there are no subsequent periods to sell remaining stock. The current demand regime (P44-P48) averages 181.2 units. Recent demand has been 157, 157, 222, 172, and 166. A safe estimate for Period 50 demand is approximately 180 units. To cover a demand of 180 units with 53 units already on hand, I need 127 additional units. The OR recommendation of 61 units is based on long-term historical averages (which include the much lower early-game demand) and is insufficient for the current high-demand regime. Ordering 127 units targets an ending inventory of 0 based on the recent average demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation from 61 to 127 units to meet the current high-demand regime (~180 units) and target zero ending inventory for the final period.",
