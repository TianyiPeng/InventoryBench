Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0. Since there is no historical data yet to suggest lead time variability or demand shifts, I will use the established historical demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) to set the initial parameters. The mean of these samples is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the review+lead period covers 1 period. I will use 'default' for L (0) and calculate 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available samples to establish a baseline. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that targets a high service level due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio = 0.95).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we observe that the previous period's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0), which matches the promised lead time. The initial demand in Period 1 was 50 units. Historical samples show demand values of 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56. The mean of these historical samples is approximately 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Given the limited sample size (N=5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent pattern. Since the actual lead time observed in Period 1 was 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use observed lead time data. The base stock level will be calculated by the OR engine using these parameters to maintain a service level consistent with a ~$19 profit and $1 holding cost (approx 95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 50 (30 historical + 20 incremental). In Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 91 (49 historical + 42 incremental), resulting in a stockout (66 units available vs 91 demanded) and ending inventory of 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand pattern shows a clear upward trend compared to the initial 5-sample historical average of 49.6. Specifically, the last two observations (50 and 91) average ~70.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=2) for demand mean to capture the upward shift while maintaining default calculation for volatility until more data is available. L is set to default as 0 is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1098.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the demand for the first three periods was 50, 91, and 60 respectively (Note: Period 2 demand includes lost sales as 66 units were sold out of a demand of 91). The average demand is currently 67.0 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with the 'conclude' messages, actual lead time has been 0 periods for all orders placed so far. In Period 3, we ended with 42 units on-hand. Given the variance in demand (std \u2248 21), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current mean demand of 67, while using the default calculation for sigma_hat to ensure adequate safety stock for the observed volatility. L will remain at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $904.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (having just concluded Period 5). The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4 confirm that the actual lead time has consistently been 0. Historical demand samples are [30, 49, 48, 65, 56]. The mean demand across these 5 periods is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. There is no evidence of a regime shift or heavy seasonality yet, as the demand fluctuates around the 50-mark. In-transit inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is 46. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent mean and variance, providing a stable basis for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. Given L=0, mu_hat will represent demand for (1+0)=1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1310.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the on-hand inventory is 20 units with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [30, 49, 48, 65, 56], with a mean of 49.6 units per period. The 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-5 consistently show that orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 is currently stable. Given the relatively small sample size (5) and no clear regime shift or seasonal signal yet, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the average demand. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for one period (1+L=1). The historical average is ~50. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the actual lead time and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to ensure the OR backend captures the current volatility and mean accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1307.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 6 concluded periods. Demand samples are: 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70. This results in a mean of 65.17 and a standard deviation of 15.68. There appears to be a slight upward trend in recent demand (mean of last 3 periods is 63.3, but the last two were exactly 70). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally target a high service level. Current on-hand is 23 units, and with no units in transit, we need a robust order to cover the next immediate period of demand. I will use a window of 5 to capture the recent higher activity while maintaining some stability against the high variance seen in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1786.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand spiked unexpectedly to 106 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 94, ending on-hand 0). Historical demand samples provided (P1-P5: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56) differ slightly from the concluded demand (P1-P7: 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106). The actual demand mean over the last 7 periods is approx 71 units, but more importantly, there is an upward trend or high volatility in recent periods (P5-P7 avg = 82). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (mu_hat for L=0 will be approx 82) and increase sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to provide a larger safety buffer against the stockouts seen in P2 and P7. This will help the OR backend set a higher base stock level to prevent further lost sales given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility and mean shifted upwards from P5 onwards; P7 demand spike (106) confirms high variability.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the history shows that the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand shifted significantly starting around Period 5. Demand from P5 to P8 was: 70, 70, 106, 65. This gives a mean of 77.75 and a standard deviation of approximately 19.1. The previous carry-over insight noted a shift in volatility and mean from P5 onwards, which is supported by the P7 spike (106). Current on-hand inventory is 52. Since L=0, we need to cover only the upcoming period's demand (Review Period + Lead Time = 1 period). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-volatile regime (P5-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1651.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand from Period 5 onwards shows a clear upward shift compared to Periods 1-4. Specifically, demand in Periods 5-9 was [70, 70, 106, 65, 88], averaging 79.8 units, whereas Periods 1-4 averaged 62.75 units. Period 7 showed a significant spike (106), indicating increased volatility in this new regime. To capture this sustained higher demand level while acknowledging the recent variability, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus on this current regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the higher observed variance (std \u2248 17.5 in the last 5 periods vs \u2248 11.5 in the first 4). With L=0, base stock logic will target covering demand for the current period (the one following this decision).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 5: Average demand increased from ~63 to ~80 (+27%); volatility increased significantly (sigma roughly doubled).

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 5. Prior to Period 5, demand averaged ~63 units; from Period 5 to 10, the demand sequence is 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, which averages ~74.3 units. However, the volatility has increased significantly, with a peak of 106 and a recent low of 47. Based on the carry-over insights and historical data, I am focusing on this more recent regime (N=6) to capture the higher variance. The lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 61 and recent demand has been as high as 106, I want the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for this high volatility and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which demands a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift in the demand regime. From Period 5 to Period 11, the average demand is approximately 73.1 units per period, compared to the initial lower levels. While Period 10 was lower (47), Period 11 saw demand rise back to 66. The volatility has also increased, exemplified by the spike of 106 in Period 7. Regarding lead time, every order from Period 1 to Period 11 has successfully arrived within 0 periods (same-day arrival). Therefore, I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 7 to align with the detected demand regime that began around Period 5. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the higher mean and volatility observed in these most recent periods, ensuring better coverage for current demand levels while balancing the holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1995.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked significantly to 112 units, exceeding the on-hand inventory and resulting in stockouts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Looking at the demand history since the detected regime shift at Period 5, we observe a higher mean and significant volatility (samples: 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66, 112). Calculating the mean for this 8-period window gives ~78 units. Given the high volatility and recent peak of 112, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this higher mean and the increased standard deviation. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that better protects against these frequent spikes (106 and 112) while factoring in the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high within the P5 regime, with a second major spike (112) observed in P12, confirming the need for a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2185.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 5. The recent demand history shows frequent spikes (P12: 112, P13: 118) and high variability. In both Period 12 and Period 13, all available stock was sold out, resulting in lost sales. The current inventory status is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, meaning the system is starting from an empty state. Historical 'conclude' messages consistently show that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). I will use the recent regime (P5-P13) to set parameters. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=9 (covering the regime from P5 to P13) to capture the higher mean (~82 units/period). For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N with N=9 to ensure a high safety stock is maintained to protect against the frequent demand surges that have caused stockouts recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 5 confirmed: Average demand ~82 units/period (up from ~60) with high volatility and frequent spikes exceeding 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1896.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 5. Reviewing the last 10 periods (P5-P14), the mean demand is approximately 84.3 units, compared to the earlier periods which averaged around 60. Volatility is high, with several spikes exceeding 100 units (P7: 106, P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101). The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met. To capture this new, higher-demand environment while accounting for the high \u03c3 observed in recent periods, I will use recent_N with N=10 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant history since the regime shift to set a base stock that can cover these frequent spikes, maintaining a high service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 5 confirmed: Average demand has risen to ~84 units/period with high volatility (multiple spikes >100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1756.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 5. Analyzing the demand from Period 5 to Period 15, the mean is approximately 84.6 units per period (samples: 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66, 112, 118, 101, 94). There is high volatility with significant spikes (e.g., 106, 112, 118, 101). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this new regime while respecting the high variance, I will use recent_N with N=11 (the length of the current regime from Period 5 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses a base stock level that accounts for the recent average and the observed volatility to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1637.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained upward shift in demand that began around Period 5. For the most recent 12 periods (P5-P16), the mean demand is approximately 85.4 units, which is significantly higher than the initial periods. We are also seeing high volatility, with three distinct spikes over 100 units in the last five periods (P12, P13, P14). The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), requiring us to maintain sufficient base stock to cover these frequent demand spikes. I will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this higher mean and volatility for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P5-P16): Mean demand ~85 units/period (+30% from initial levels); significant volatility persists with 25% of recent periods exceeding 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2138.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift that occurred around Period 5. Since then, demand has consistently averaged around 85-90 units per period, with extreme volatility characterized by frequent spikes above 100 units (e.g., P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101, P17: 113). The lead time remains consistently at 0, meaning orders arrive and are sold within the same period. Given the current low on-hand inventory of 9 units and the high target service level (q = 19 / (19+1) = 0.95), I need mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime to ensure we can cover another possible 110+ demand spike. I will use N=13 for the demand parameters, capturing all data from the P5 regime shift to the present, to provide a stable but responsive estimate of both the higher mean and the elevated standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P5-P17 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 87 units/period with significant volatility (std dev approx 20); 30% of periods in this regime have demand exceeding 100 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 5 and has continued to show high levels and volatility. Since Period 12, demand has consistently been high, frequently exceeding 110 units (P12: 112, P13: 118, P17: 113, P18: 116). The average demand for the last 7 periods (P12-P18) is approximately 107.4 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) after a period where demand (116) caught up to the order (116) almost exactly. To prevent stockouts, I need to use the recent_N method focused on this high-demand window. I will set N=7 to capture this most recent surge. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime refined: Since Period 12, demand has increased to an average of ~107 units/period, with high volatility and frequent spikes >110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2314.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Since Period 12, the mean demand has increased to approximately 111 units per period (P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101, P15: 94, P16: 88, P17: 113, P18: 116, P19: 122). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this higher demand and its volatility, I am using recent statistics from the last 8 periods (P12-P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a high service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 12 confirmed: Average demand has risen to ~111 units/period, with multiple occurrences exceeding 115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2091.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 12, as highlighted in the carry-over insights. Looking at the last 9 periods (P12-P20), the demand has consistently stayed high with a mean of approximately 108.3 units and a high frequency of values exceeding 110 units (P12: 112, P13: 118, P17: 113, P18: 116, P19: 122, P20: 111). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To accurately capture this elevated demand stage and account for the high volatility (standard deviation in this period is approx 9.5), I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand regime rather than the lower averages from earlier in the game, ensuring we maintain enough stock to satisfy these frequent spikes while minimizing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12-P20 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 108 units/period, representing a sustained +25-30% increase from the P5-P11 average. High volatility persists with demand frequently exceeding 115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand hit an all-time high of 155 units, resulting in a stockout despite the order arriving on time (lead time observed consistently as 0 per 'conclude' messages). This confirms a significant upward demand shift. The regime that started around Period 12 has accelerated; the average demand from Period 12 to 21 is approximately 113 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) average 123.4 units with high volatility (std dev ~18.5). To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while weighting the recent surge. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (P12-P21) will result in a base stock that accounts for both the higher mean and the increased variance, ensuring the backend's capped policy provides sufficient stock for the next period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Average demand from P17-P21 reached ~123 units, with a peak of 155 units in P21, indicating a further upward shift or extreme volatility spike compared to the P12-P16 period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear upward trend and high volatility. Since Period 17, the mean demand has increased to approximately 123 units per period (P17-P22 average), with a significant peak of 155 units in P21. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's target service level (q) is high (~95%). To capture the most recent and relevant regime shift while accounting for the high volatility observed in the last 6 periods (P17-P22), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher average demand and the increased standard deviation necessitated by recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 17: Average demand increased to ~123 units/period (a ~15% increase from the P12-P16 average), characterized by extreme volatility and a peak of 155 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2270.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 17. From P17 to P23, the demand average has reached approximately 122 units per period (113, 116, 122, 111, 155, 117, 121), showing a consistent step up from the previous regime (P12-P16, avg ~107). Volatility remains high, notably the spike to 155 in P21. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this most recent higher-demand state while accounting for current inventory (on-hand 29, in-transit 0), I will use the recent_N method with N=7 (covering P17-P23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~122 mean plus a buffer for the observed high variance, aiming to prevent the stockouts seen in P21 and P13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 17 stabilized at an average of ~122 units/period (compared to ~107 in P12-P16). High volatility persists with a significant peak of 155 units in P21.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-volume regime since Period 17. The average demand from P17 to P24 is approximately 121 units per period (113, 116, 122, 111, 155, 117, 121, 126). This reflects a sustained upward shift from the previous regime (P12-P16 avg ~107) and significantly higher than the initial periods. Volatility remains high, notably the spike to 155 in P21. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent high-demand regime while accounting for the significant variance, I am setting L to default (0) and using recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent 8-period window (P17-P24) to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current 120+ units/period average and the increased volatility, safeguarding against stockouts in a high-margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P24 confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~121 units/period, representing a ~13% increase from the P12-P16 regime, with frequent demand exceeding 125 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 17. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the average demand is 124.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. Most recently, P25 demand was 137, following a trend of consistently high values. On-hand inventory is very low at 9 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture this specific high-demand regime for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This will ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current average and the high variance observed (including the 155 unit spike in P21), maintaining a high service level appropriate for a product with a $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P25 confirmed: Mean demand is ~124 units/period, with persistent high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 14) and frequent peaks exceeding 135 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 17. From P17 to P26, the mean demand is approximately 121 units/period with significant volatility (standard deviation ~17). The most recent period (P26) saw a lower demand of 90, which is within the range of observed volatility but below the recent average. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (target quantile ~95%). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current regime's mean and variance effectively while accounting for the recent high-demand environment, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10), covering P17-P26. This window accurately reflects the 'post-acceleration' demand level noted in the carry-over insights.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 27, the mean demand is approximately 120 units per period (1321 total / 11 periods). While Period 26 showed a lower demand of 90, Period 27 returned to 107. The volatility remains significant with frequent spikes (e.g., 155 in P21). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover these frequent spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P27 confirmed: Mean demand is ~120 units/period with continued high volatility; the lower demand in P26 (90) appears to be an outlier within this high-demand regime rather than a new downward shift.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains stable with an average demand of approximately 120 units/period (P17-P28 mean \u2248 121). The most recent demand (P28=135) followed a lower period (P27=107), confirming that high volatility persists within this high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~17), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the Period 17 to present regime). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the elevated mean and the significant spikes observed (e.g., 155 in P21), maintaining a high service level to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2812.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift. Period 29 recorded a demand of 161, following a pattern of increasing peaks (Period 21 was 155, Period 28 was 135). The average demand from Period 17 to Period 29 is approximately 124 units. However, looking at the most recent 10 periods (P20-P29) to capture the accelerating trend, the average is ~126 units, but with recent peaks exceeding 150. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) versus low holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 95%. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the regime from Period 17 to present) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will allow the backend to account for the sustained higher volume and the substantial volatility (spikes like 155 and 161). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed at Period 29: New peak demand of 161 observed; the P17-P29 average is ~124 units, but volatility is increasing with multiple spikes >150 in the last 10 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a higher mean with increased volatility starting around Period 17, and further accelerating around Period 29. The most recent demand samples (P29: 161, P30: 132) confirm a sustained high-demand environment. Since Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 125 units per period with a significant standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be realized consistently (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the backend logic (z* \u2248 2.33) will naturally favor a high service level. To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent extreme spikes like the 161 in Period 29, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (spanning back to Period 17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term regime average with the recent spike sensitivity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2964.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly across the game. Starting at ~60 in P1-P4, it rose to ~85 (P5-P11), then to ~107 (P12-P16), and most recently to ~124 (P17-P31). In the last 11 periods (P21-P31), the mean demand is approximately 132 units/period, with high volatility and frequent spikes (e.g., 155 in P21, 161 in P29, 165 in P31). Demand occurred at 165 in P31, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives in the same period. To account for this latest high-demand plateau and protect against the frequent spikes (>150), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (since P17), which captures the current high-demand regime while including enough samples to estimate the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~107 to ~128 (+20%) in the P17-P31 block, with a further acceleration observed from P29-P31 where demand averaged 152. Volatility remains high, with frequent spikes exceeding 150 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 29, marked by significant spikes (161 in P29, 165 in P31). While Period 32 demand was lower (116), the recent 4-period mean (P29-P32) is approximately 143.5 units. The P17-P32 regime as a whole averages ~126 units, but the last few periods demonstrate higher volatility and higher peaks. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.95), I must protect against these frequent spikes (>150 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent acceleration in demand mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the latest trend while the OR backend's safety stock logic accounts for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed: Mean demand from P29-P32 is ~144 units/period, with frequent spikes exceeding 160 units (e.g., P31 demand was 165), indicating a move into a higher-demand bracket compared to the P17-P28 average of ~120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3397.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has accelerated significantly starting at Period 29. Demand in the most recent five periods (P29-P33) has averaged 150.6 units (161, 132, 165, 116, 179), with multiple spikes exceeding 160 units. This is a substantial increase from the P17-P28 average of approximately 120 units. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) following a high demand period (179 units sold). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals (e.g., P33 order of 137 arrived in P33). To capture this newest high-demand regime, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to prioritize the most recent mean and volatility levels (~150 mean with high variance), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent stockouts during this peak period while balancing the relatively low holding cost ($1) against the profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed at P29: Average demand for P29-P33 is ~151 units/period (+25% over P17-P28 average), with frequent spikes >160 units (P31: 165, P33: 179).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly since Period 29. The average demand for the period P29-P34 is approximately 149 units (161, 132, 165, 116, 179, 131), which represents a ~24% increase over the previous regime's average (P17-P28, avg ~120). Volatility remains extreme, with a standard deviation in this newest period of approximately 25 and frequent spikes exceeding 160. Following the strategy of reacting to the most recent stable regime, I will use N=6 (the length of the current regime starting at P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and elevated variance. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: Average demand Increased to ~149 units/period (compared to ~120 in P17-P28) with high volatility and frequent spikes exceeding 160 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration confirmed around Period 29. From Period 29 through Period 35, the average demand has risen significantly to approximately 147 units per period, compared to the Period 17-28 average of ~121. Volatility is very high, with recent peaks reaching 161 (P29), 165 (P31), 179 (P33), and 144 (P35). Given the High Profit to Holding Cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts during these high-demand spikes. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. To account for the recent sustained increase and extreme volatility, I will use a N=7 window (Periods 29-35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and its associated variance, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current trend of frequent spikes exceeding 160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3416.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several upward shifts throughout the game. The most recent and significant regime change began at Period 29. From P29 to P36, the average demand is 141 units/period, with high volatility evidenced by three spikes exceeding 160 units (P29: 161, P31: 165, P33: 179) and a recent high of 180 in P36. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the current very low on-hand inventory (4 units) and consistent same-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P29-P36). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer against the frequent 150+ unit spikes, minimizing lost sales while acknowledging the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P29-P36 confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~141 units/period, marked by extreme volatility and frequent spikes exceeding 160 units (P31: 165, P33: 179, P36: 180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3629.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration occurring at Period 29. The demand mean from Period 29 to Period 37 is approximately 156 units/period (average of 161, 132, 165, 116, 179, 131, 144, 180, 199). The most recent period (P37) saw a record demand of 199, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms a sustained high-demand environment with extreme volatility (spikes >180). Given the lead time of 0 periods, the system must aggressively stock up to meet this elevated mean and high variance. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (starting from the P29 shift) to capture this high-growth regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current ~156 unit mean and high standard deviation, providing sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: New peak demand of 199 observed; the average demand for the P29-P37 period has risen to ~156 units/period, with volatility increasing as 4 of the last 7 periods exceeded 165 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting around Period 29, with a further acceleration observed in Period 37. Average demand for the P29-P38 segment is approximately 157.8 units, compared to ~120 in the preceding regime. Volatility is very high, with recent periods showing demand spikes up to 199. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this higher stabilized demand and the extreme spikes (e.g., P33: 179, P36: 180, P37: 199, P38: 171), I am selecting recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (P29-P38). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated mean (~158) plus a safety buffer for the high variance observed in these last 10 periods, ensuring a high service level for this high-profit SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: Demand has entered a higher bracket with an average of ~158 units over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) and extreme peaks reaching 199 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 37, with the latest periods (P37-P39) showing demand values of 199, 171, and 179. The average demand over the last 11 periods (since the previous regime shift in P29) is approximately 151 units, but the most recent 3 periods average 183 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the inventory policy should aggressively protect against stockouts during this upward trend. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P29-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from Period 29 while acknowledging the recent peak volatility. This N provides a sufficient sample of the high-demand volatility observed in the current environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed from P37 onwards: Demand has averaged 183 over the last 3 periods, with a peak of 199, suggesting a higher bracket than the P29-P36 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3317.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct higher regime starting from Period 37, with demand values of 199, 171, 179, and 176 (Average: 181.25). This follows an earlier acceleration at Period 29. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals. Given the recent stabilization in the 170-180 range, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this most recent bracket (P37-P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current high demand and volatility, maintaining high service levels (q ~ 0.95) to avoid stockouts which have occurred recently when demand spiked (e.g., P37).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed from Period 37 onwards: Average demand is ~181 units/period with frequent values exceeding 175 units, representing an upward shift from the P29-P36 average (~149).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several upward shifts, with the most recent sustained regime beginning at Period 37. Since P37, average demand has increased to approximately 173 units per period (199, 171, 179, 176, 142), significantly higher than the previous Period 29-36 average (~149). While Period 41 showed a dip to 142, the overall trend from P37-P41 remains high with significant volatility. Given the high profit margins ($19.0) relative to holding costs ($1.0), the objective is to maintain a high service level to avoid stockouts during spikes. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P37 onwards: Mean demand approximately 173 units/period (compared to ~149 in P29-P36) with high volatility and peaks near 200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3652.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-demand regime that stabilized around Period 37. Examining the most recent 6 periods (P37-P42), the average demand is 176.6 units per period, but the volatility remains significant, with a peak of 199 and a recent high of 193 in Period 42. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives within the same period (L=0 verified by history), the order must cover the current period's demand. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current mean of the P37+ regime (~176). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to appropriately weight the high volatility (std dev ~20 in this window) which informs the safety stock required to avoid stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P37-P42 confirmed: Average demand is approximately 177 units/period with persistent high volatility and peaks reaching nearly 200 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 37. Over the last 7 periods (P37-P43), the average demand is approximately 175.14 units/period, with high volatility evidenced by a peak of 199 and a low of 142. The most recent demand (P43) was 166. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the system must maintain a high service level to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently in the past during demand spikes. I will set the demand forecast based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this most recent high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift from P37: Mean demand for P37-P43 is ~175 units/period, representing a significant increase from the P29-P36 average (~149). Volatility remains high, requiring a larger safety stock to cover spikes near 200 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has stabilized with an average of approximately 172.5 units per period and a standard deviation of about 18.5 units. Recent demand samples (P37-P44) are: 199, 171, 179, 176, 142, 193, 166, 181. Current on-hand inventory is 25 units. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture this regime (P37-P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the current mean demand and the high volatility/peaks near 200 units. The L is set to default as observations confirm same-period delivery.

Period 45 recorded a high demand of 201, confirming that peaks near or exceeding 200 units remain a significant risk. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on this, I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N approach with N=9 (covering Period 37 to Period 45) to capture the current regime's mean and high volatility (~177 mean and ~17-18 std dev). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the top end of the current demand distribution (approx 205-210 units) without excessive overstocking, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P37-P45 confirmed: Mean demand is ~177 units/period with persistent high volatility and demand frequently testing the 200-unit threshold (P37: 199, P42: 193, P45: 201).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 37. Analyzing the block from Period 37 to Period 46 shows a mean demand of approximately 175.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The most recent demand (P46) was 144, which is lower than the average but within the expected variance. Demand frequently tests the 200-unit threshold (P45: 201, P42: 193, P37: 199), requiring significant safety stock given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current P37 regime and the transition from the P29 regime. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3751.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 37. In the last 11 periods (P37-P47), demand has averaged approximately 177 units, with frequent peaks reaching or exceeding 200 units (P45: 201, P37: 199, P47: 198). The most recent period (P47) had a demand of 198, which is well above the long-term average but consistent with this current high-demand bracket. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the mean of this current regime (~177 units). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this period, ensuring the OR backend maintains enough safety stock to cover the frequent spikes near 200 units while balancing against holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the game (Period 48 of 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3928.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant sustained increase starting from Period 37. Analyzing the most recent block (P37-P48), the mean demand is approximately 179 units per period, with extreme volatility characterized by multiple peaks near or exceeding 200 units (P37: 199, P45: 201, P48: 207). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since we are at Period 49 (near the end of the simulation), the objective remains to satisfy the high demand while accounting for recent variance. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus specifically on the high-demand regime that began in Period 37. This N captures the full extent of the current stabilized yet volatile bracket, allowing the OR backend to compute a base stock that protects against the frequent 200+ unit spikes seen in the last 10+ periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P37-P48 confirmed: Mean demand is ~179 units/period (up from ~150 in the P29-P36 bracket), with demand frequently testing or exceeding the 200-unit threshold (P45: 201, P48: 207).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 37. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P37-P49), the mean demand is approximately 180.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. The most recent demand (P49) was 193 units, following a peak of 207 in P48, confirming that demand frequently clusters near or above the 200-unit mark. There are no signs of a downward shift. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (~0.95), justifying a robust safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand spikes. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while excluding older, lower-demand data.
