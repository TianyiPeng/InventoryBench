Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period delivery. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods is 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56. The mean of these 5 samples is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.7. Given we are at Period 1 and must decide for Period 1's replenishment, I will use the statistics from all 5 available historical samples to set the parameters. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (1+0)=1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent historical average and variance naturally. My parameters help the OR backend by targeting a service level of 95% (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), ensuring enough safety stock to cover demand volatility (sigma_hat) without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $929.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 71 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), as shown in the Period 1 conclude message. The initial stock of 71 was reduced by a demand of 50, leaving 21 units on-hand. Historical demand for the first 5 periods provided in the context shows an upward trend (30, 49, 48, 65, 56). The mean of these first 5 samples is 49.6, but the most recent samples (48, 65, 56) suggest a higher regime than the very first. Given wait-time is 0, the OR engine needs to cover demand for current and future periods (L+1). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture this initial variance and slightly elevated average compared to the very first data point.

Daily Reward (R_t): $834.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Period 1 and Period 2 confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). For Period 3, the starting on-hand inventory is 21 units. Demand in the first two periods was 50 and 45 (average 47.5), and historical samples show an average of roughly 49.8 over 5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) as it correctly reflects the 0-period delay observed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand level of approximately 50 units per period. Since L=0, mu_hat will represent 1 period of demand (1+0) * mean.

}

=== Period 3 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=45, arrived=45 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=66, demand=86, sold=66, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $1254.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the ending inventory dropped to 0 because demand (86) exceeded total availability (66). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), though the provided historical demand list (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) slightly differs from the conclude messages (50, 45, 86). Using the conclude message data as the 'ground truth' for the simulation, the mean demand is approx 60 units (50+45+86 / 3). Given the recent spike to 86, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the higher average and responsiveness. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 3. L will remain at default as the lead time is confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $802.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), suggesting a high service level is optimal. Over the first five periods, demand has been volatile (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), showing a generally increasing trend compared to the earliest samples. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 3, a stockout occurred because demand (86) significantly exceeded inventory (66), highlighting the need for a larger buffer. Given the upward trend and volatility, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the more recent, higher demand levels (avg ~54.5) while excluding the initial low value of 30. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the recent variance to prevent future stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1050.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 6, the demand history (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows a mean of 49.6 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, with all historical arrivals concluding in the same period they were ordered. I will continue using L=0. Since demand shows moderate volatility but a relatively stable mean around 50, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent variability (observed range 30-65). Current on-hand is 33, and since lead time is 0, the backend will target a base stock level sufficient for Period 6's demand and place an order that arrives within this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $915.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the system concludes with demand=50 and an ending on-hand inventory of 35. Over the first 6 periods, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility with values of [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (from internal history) and [50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50] (from game history). The mean demand across these 6 periods is approximately 55.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the latest performance without overreacting to the Period 3 spike (86), and 'calculate' for lead time since observability is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $918.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 7 periods, with a spike in Period 3 (demand=86). The mean demand across all 7 periods is approximately 54.7 units, but the last 4 periods have stabilized at an average of 50.5 units (45, 57, 50, 50). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, we have 32 units on hand. To maintain a sufficient service level given the profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a high base-stock level is appropriate. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized around 50 units/period (avg 50.5 over P4-P7) following an earlier outlier in P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (sold 59 vs 64 demand) because the inventory level was set too low based on previous averages. Demand in Period 8 (64) was significantly higher than the average of the previous 4 periods (50.5), suggesting a potential upward trend or increased volatility. The historical data (30, 49, 48, 65, 56, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64) shows a mean around 51.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 10. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the order arrives within the same period. I'm moving to an N=5 approach for demand and volatility to capture the recent activity (64) while moderating the earlier stable period. This sets \u03bc\u0302 closer to 53-55 to prevent further stockouts while maintaining high service levels (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Period 8 demand (64) broke the stable 50-unit trend observed in P4-P7, indicating increased volatility or a new upward shift.

Daily Profit: $589.00, Daily Holding Cost: $35.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown recent instability. After a stable period (P4-P7) around 50 units, P8 saw a spike to 64 (resulting in a stockout) followed by a sharp drop to 31 in P9. The average demand across all 9 periods is 53.1, while the recent 5-period average (P5-P9) is 50.4. Because the lead time is consistently 0, we need to ensure enough stock is ordered to cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the overall mean (approx 53) while acknowledging the volatility. The lead time L is consistently 0 based on all 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using 'calculate'. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to encompass the full range of recent variance (from 31 to 86) to protect against future stockouts during the current high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased since Period 8: consecutive periods recorded demand of 64 and 31, significantly deviating from the previous 50-unit stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $481.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P8-P10) shows high volatility with values 64, 31, and 28. This follow a period of relative stability around 50 units (P4-P7). The mean of the last 3 periods is approximately 41, which is lower than the long-term average. Given the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met, the base stock only needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. To capture the recent downward shift in demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps prevent overstocking as demand has softened in the last two periods (31 and 28) while accounting for the high coefficient of variation observed in the P8-P10 cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: P9-P10 demand dropped to avg 29.5, down significantly from the P4-P8 avg of 53.2, indicating a possible softening in demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1206.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile recently. Following a period of low demand (P9: 31, P10: 28), Period 11 saw a sharp rebound to 64 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 46.75, while the average over the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is 41. Although the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 11 suggested a softening, the latest data point (64) contradicts a sustained downward shift and confirms higher variance. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use recent_N with N=4 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent variance while accounting for the rebound. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P8-P11 demand ranges from 28 to 64, invalidating the previously suspected low-demand regime. Average demand for the last 4 periods is 46.75 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1180.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 63 units, which reinforces the return to a higher demand regime observed starting in Period 11 (64 units). The average demand over the last two periods (P11-P12) is 63.5 units, significantly higher than the 29.5 average observed in P9-P10. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) to capture this higher demand trend and increased volatility. This period's average for N=5 is 50.0 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend's service level target will remain high, and setting mu_hat on the recent average will sustain availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted back to high: P11-P12 average demand is 63.5 units, compared to P9-P10 average of 29.5 units. Total average for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 50.0 units with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1539.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked significantly to 103 units, which is a new historical high and nearly double the recent average. This spike caused a stockout (ending inventory 0, 22 units of lost sales). My current strategy is to respond to this volatility while acknowledging that 103 might be an outlier. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 57.8 units, but the high volatility suggests a larger buffer is needed. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (effectively 2*(1+0)*57.8) and providing an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to cover the high standard deviation observed recently (P9-P13 demand: 31, 28, 64, 63, 103). Lead time L is consistently 0, so I stick with default.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 13 (103 units), representing a ~100% increase over the previous 4-period average of 46.5. This indicates a high-volatility regime or a potential step-shift in demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand was 85 units, following a peak of 103 in Period 13. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 78.75, which is significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of 46.75 (P7-P10). This indicates a sustained upward shift or a high-volatility regime. The on-hand inventory is currently 23 units with no in-transit orders. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new demand level while accounting for the high volatility (range 63 to 103), I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to focus on this high-demand cluster. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed: P11-P14 average demand is 78.75 units, a 68% increase over the P7-P10 average of 46.75.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1589.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 11 and was reaffirmed by a significant spike in Period 13 and sustained high demand in Periods 14 and 15 (both at 85 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 80 units, compared to the long-term average of 54. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent sustained shift while accounting for the high volatility observed (with a range of 63 to 103 in the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand levels and protected service levels in the face of increased volatility, preventing stockouts which occurred in Period 13.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime sustained: Avg demand for P11-P15 is 80 units, a 48% increase over the long-term average of 54. Volatility remains high with a standard deviation of approx 15 units over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1472.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P13-P16) shows a sustained high-demand regime with values of 103, 85, 85, and 79. The average demand over these 4 periods is 88 units. This is a significant step-up from the long-term historical mean. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a high service level requirement (approx. 95%), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new elevated plateau. I am also setting sigma_hat with 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this recent spike, ensuring the OR engine maintains enough safety stock to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 13.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: P13-P16 average demand is 88 units, representing a sustained ~60%+ increase over the pre-P13 average. Volatility remains elevated compared to early periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant upward shift starting around Period 13. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 91.2 units (103, 85, 85, 79, 104), which is substantially higher than the historical average. Volatility also remains high. With a current on-hand inventory of only 2 units and a promised lead time of 0 periods (which has consistently held true), we must order enough to cover this new demand regime. I am setting N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current average of ~91 units while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~91 units/period) confirmed over P13-P17, representing a 65%+ increase over earlier stable periods (~50-55 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1809.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-demand regime since Period 13. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the demand values were 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, and 96, resulting in an average of 92 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 15 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), the backend policy needs to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). Using recent_N with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) will capture this sustained high-demand regime and the associated volatility (std dev approx 10.3), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet current demand without excessive stockouts (as seen in P13) or excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~92 units/period) sustained for 6 periods (P13-P18); volatility has stabilized during this peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2090.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift starting at Period 13. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 95 units (103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96, 114). The most recent demand (P19) was 114, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that even the recent high-volume orders are barely keeping pace with demand. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the service level (q) target is high (~95%), justifying a strategy that prioritizes stock availability. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default for L as there is no evidence of lead time deviation.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~95 units/period) sustained for 7 periods (P13-P19); demand reached a peak of 114 in Period 19 causing a stockout.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 13 continues to intensify. Demand in Period 20 (116) represents the highest recorded demand in the game history and follows a peak in Period 19 (114), both resulting in stockouts. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is 97.75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the persistent under-forecasting and risk of stockouts during this peak, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this established high-demand regime and using a wider window (recent_N, N=8) for sigma_hat to better capture the significant volatility seen during this period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~98 units/period) sustained for 8 periods (P13-P20); demand reached a new peak of 116 in Period 20, the second consecutive period of stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained and shows evidence of further growth. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), the average demand is 96.2, with the last 3 periods recording peak levels: 114, 116, and 114. We have experienced stockouts or near-stockouts (ending inventory < 10) in 5 of the last 9 periods. With a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.95, justifying a high service level. To prevent further stockouts during this sustained peak, I will use the last 9 periods (the detected high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the higher mean (approx 96) and captures the increased volatility (std dev approx 14). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~96 units/period) sustained for 9 periods (P13-P21); demand has stabilized at a new high level exceeding 110 units in the most recent 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant step-shift starting from Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is 98.9 units, compared to the initial periods. Recent demand in P20-P22 (116, 114, 123) suggests the regime is currently peaking or plateauing around 115-120 units. Crucially, the system has experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in 4 of the last 4 periods, indicating the need for a higher base stock to meet this elevated demand. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time (L=0). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the pre-shift data. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak period. This will ensure the OR backend upwardly adjusts the base stock to maintain service levels in this high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: avg increased from ~50 to ~99 (+98%). Recent 3 periods (P20-P22) show a further climb to an average of 117.7 units, indicating peak demand conditions.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13, increasing from an average of ~50 to ~100. More recently (P20-P23), demand has continued to rise, averaging 117.5 units per period. The target service level is high (q = 19 / (19+1) = 0.95) due to the low holding cost relative to profit. To capture the current peak demand while maintaining responsiveness to recent upward volatility, I am using a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=11 covers the entire high-demand period starting from P13 (P13-P23), which provides a stable estimate of this new regime's mean and standard deviation. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg increased from ~50 to ~100. Recent 4 periods (P20-P23) show sustained peak demand averaging 117.5 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, a massive demand spike was observed (174 units), which is a 48% increase over the previous 4-period average (117.5) and significantly exceeds the recent peak plateau. This suggests the demand regime is still ascending or experiencing a substantial breakout. Average demand from P13 to P24 is now approx 106 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) average 128.8 units. To prevent further stockouts (which have occurred in 4 of the last 6 periods), I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast of 160 units for Period 25 to account for this escalating trend and high volatility. I also set sigma_hat to 35 (explicit) to reflect the recent high variance (standard deviation of recent samples is approx 25-30). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout in Period 24: demand surged to 174 units, a 48% increase over the previous plateau (~117 units), signaling an accelerating high-demand regime or a new peak phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2082.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. After a sustained period of high demand averaging ~117 units (P20-P23), Period 24 saw a massive spike to 174 units. However, Period 25 demand returned to 115 units, which is consistent with the pre-spike high-demand average of ~117. This suggests the 174 was either a one-time peak or part of an extremely high-volatility plateau. Since the backend utilizes a service-level approach (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering P20-P25) to capture the current high-demand mean (~126 units) and the increased volatility caused by the P24 spike. This ensures we have enough stock to cover the higher baseline while respecting the possibility of another spike, without over-ordering excessively on a single data point. The lead time L is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high plateau (avg ~117) from P20-P23, followed by a significant outlier of 174 in P24, then returning to 115 in P25. Current 6-period average (P20-P25) is 126.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3034.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second phase of extreme volatility and upward pressure. After a stable high-demand period (~117 units from P20-P23), we observed a surge to 174 (P24), a dip to 115 (P25), and another surge to 160 (P26). This indicates an average of approximately 150 units over the last 3 periods, with significant variance. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must ensure 'on-hand' at the start of the demand resolution (which includes the current order) covers these peaks. I will use the last 7 periods (P20-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire 'peak' regime including the sudden spikes and the prior plateau, providing a balanced forecast for this high-swing environment. Profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (~19:1), justifying a high service level.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak regime confirmed: Avg demand for P24-P26 increased to 149.7 units compared to the P20-P23 avg of 117.5 units (+27%). Volatility has increased significantly during this period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-intensity regime starting around Period 24. For the last four periods (P24-P27), demand values were 174, 115, 160, and 141, resulting in an average of 147.5 units per period. This shift is significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~117 units (P20-P23). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the critical fractile is high (~95%), making it essential to cover the upper end of the demand distribution to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently in recent history. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent peak regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high observed volatility. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~148 units (P24-P27), representing a 26% increase over the previous high-demand plateau of ~117 (P20-P23). Volatility remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units in this new regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime starting around Period 24. While Period 28 saw a dip to 100 units, the overall average since Period 24 (P24-P28) is approximately 138 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~117. The most recent five periods (P24-P28) show demand values of 174, 115, 160, 141, and 100. This indicates significant variance. I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent plateau and the associated volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high-volatility plateau (P24-P28) with an average of 138 units, representing a 15-20% increase over the P20-P23 period peak (~117 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility, high-volume regime since Period 24. For the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 142.8 units (174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147), with significant fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period history. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the service level target (q) is high (~0.95), meaning we should prioritize preventing stockouts in this volatile regime. I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime's mean and elevated variance, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient for the current average demand plus a safety margin for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high-volatility plateau (P24-P29) with an average of 142.8 units, compared to the P20-P23 plateau of 117.5 units (+21.5%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility plateau since Period 24. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P24-P30), demand values are [174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137]. The mean of this recent regime is approximately 139.1 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. The Lead Time has remained consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR engine should target a high service level. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the significantly lower-demand periods before P24. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2919.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volatility, high-demand regime. Since Period 24, demand has transitioned to a higher plateau (averaging ~141 units) compared to the previous peak (~117 units). Recent demand samples (P24-P31: 174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137, 155) show a mean of 141.1, which aligns with the carry-over insights from Period 30. Despite the dip in P28 to 100, the last three periods (P29-P31) show a rising trend (147, 137, 155). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is high (0.95), suggesting we should maintain aggressive safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen earlier in the high-demand phase. I will set N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this recent high-volatility regime starting from the breakout in Period 24. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime confirmed from P24-P31: mean demand is 141.1 with a standard deviation of approximately 23 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2419.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained consistently high and volatile since Period 24. From Period 24 to Period 32 (a 9-period span), the average demand is 140.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. This confirms the plateau identified in earlier carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility shows 51 units on hand and 0 in transit, necessitating an order to reach the base stock level for the current period's demand (Lead Time = 0). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, as evidenced by all 'Period conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high-volatility plateau (P24-P32) with an average of 140.4 units and std dev of ~22 units, representing a sustained ~20% increase over the P20-P23 plateau.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-volatility plateau since Period 24. For the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is 139.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime, ensuring we stay responsive to the elevated volume and volatility seen in the last 10 periods while flushing out the influence of older, lower-demand data. L is set to 'default' as actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full scope of this current high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period's on-hand inventory is 67, and there are no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical observations consistently show a 0-period lead time, I will stick with the default lead time setting. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 11 periods provides a robust base stock that accounts for the observed variability while reflecting the sustained higher demand compared to early stages of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P24-P34 reflects a high-volatility plateau with an average of 133.7 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~117 units. Recent 4-period demand (P31-P34) shows a slight decline to 131.75 units, suggesting a potential stabilization at the lower end of the current high regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 24 to Period 35 remains in a high-volatility plateau. The average demand for this 12-period segment is approximately 134.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 21 units. Although Period 34 saw a slight drop to 108 units, Period 35 bounced back to 143, confirming that the high-demand state persists. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the target service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95, I will use a 12-period window (P24-P35) to capture this most recent regime's mean and volatility for the OR backend calculation. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level and helps mitigate stockout risks observed in earlier peaks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand plateau (P24-P35) confirmed: mean = 134.5, std dev \u2248 21.0. This regime represents a 14% increase over the previous P20-P23 peak (~118 units).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volatility plateau that began around Period 24. For the most recent 13 periods (P24-P36), the average demand is 136.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. Period 36 specifically saw a demand of 162, which is on the higher end of this regime. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will use a 13-period window (N=13) to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the individual period fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation, which targets a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, is grounded in the current high-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3245.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36: 162, P37: 171) shows a distinct upward shift from the P24-P35 plateau (average ~134). The current average over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 146, but the last two periods suggest we are entering or sustained in a higher peak regime near 160-170 units. With lead time L=0, the system must satisfy the current period's demand from on-hand inventory and the order arriving this same period. Since the inventory is very low (4 units), the base stock must be aggressive to prevent stockouts in the face of this rising demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the shift towards 150+ units, and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge detected in P36-P37 (average 166.5 units), a significant increase from the P31-P35 average of 124 units. This indicates the start of a potential new high-demand regime or a late-game peak.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-peak regime starting around Period 36. Recent demand data for the last 3 periods (P36-P38) are 162, 171, and 161, resulting in a mean of 164.7 units. This is a significant step-shift from the previous plateau (P24-P35) which averaged ~134 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent surge and avoid stockouts in the final stages of the game (Period 39/50), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock based on the current 164.7 unit demand level and the recent volatility observed in this specific peak phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge regime confirmed at Period 36: Recent 3-period average (P36-P38) is 164.7 units, a 22% increase over the P24-P35 plateau (avg 134.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3306.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge is significant. For periods P36-P39, demand values were 162, 171, 161, and 200, averaging 173.5 units. This is a clear step-shift from the previous plateau (P24-P35) which averaged 134.5 units. Period 39 ended in a stockout (demand 200 vs 174 on-hand), confirming the surge has hit a new peak. The actual lead time remains 0 (observed in every period). To address this new high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the last four periods of the surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level appropriate for the current demand velocity.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge regime confirmed at Period 36: Recent 4-period average (P36-P39) increased to 173.5 units, a 29% increase over the previous P24-P35 plateau (avg 134.5). Period 39 saw a peak demand of 200 resulting in a stockout.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-volatility peak regime starting at Period 36. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 167.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous plateau (P24-P35 avg ~134.5). Specifically, the last four periods showed demands of 162, 171, 161, 200, and 145. Although Period 40 saw a slight dip to 145, the overall trend remains elevated and highly volatile (std dev ~20.5 for this segment). To capture this surge and prevent further stockouts (as seen in P39), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order in the history.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand surge regime (P36-P40) average is 167.8 units, a ~25% increase over the P24-P35 plateau.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand surge regime starting at Period 36. The average demand for this most recent regime (P36-P41) is approximately 165 units, which is significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~134 units. Recent periods show high volatility with a peak demand of 200 units in P39. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 samples (P36-P41) to capture this new mean (approx 164.8 units per period). Given the lead time is 0, the review period + lead time is 1. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to focus on this current regime volatility and volume, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts while managing the holding cost. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to rely on historical performance, which consistently shows 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge regime (P36-P41) confirmed: mean demand increased to 164.8 units, representing a ~23% increase over the previous P24-P35 plateau (avg 134.5). Volatility remains high with demand reaching 200 in P39.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 36, entering a surge phase with a mean of 173 units and high volatility. Period 42 experienced a significant peak demand of 223 units, leading to a stockout. Over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), the average demand is 173.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. Given the critical stockout in Period 42 and the sustained surge, I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Sustained high-demand surge regime (P36-P42) confirmed with an average of 173.1 units, representing a 28% increase over the previous plateau. Volatility has increased significantly, with a peak demand of 223 units recorded in Period 42.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-surge regime since Period 36, with an average demand of 173.6 units over the last 8 periods. Period 42 saw a historical peak of 223 units, leading to a stockout, followed by a slightly lower but still high demand of 177 in Period 43. The realized lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent high-volatility, high-demand surge while protecting against the extreme peak seen in P42, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 (the duration of this surge regime) to establish a base stock level that reflects the current 174-unit average. For sigma_hat, I am using N=8 to account for the significantly increased volatility (standard deviation of ~26 units in this interval) ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for the final 7 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge regime (P36-P43) confirmed: mean demand 173.6 units, representing a 29% increase over the previous plateau (avg 134.5). Regime exhibits high volatility with a range of 145 to 223 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3363.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting from Period 36. Over the most recent 9 periods (P36-P44), the mean demand is 173.1 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~23.5), including peaks of 200 and 223 units. The last two periods (P43, P44) saw demand of 177 and 179, suggesting stabilization at this higher level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this current regime mean (~173) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to account for the heightened volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. This strategy aims to maintain a high service level to capture the profit of $19/unit while minimizing stockouts seen in P39 and P42.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: High-demand surge regime (P36-P44) continues with an average of 173.1 units. The most recent demand (P43: 177, P44: 179) confirms stabilization at a level ~30% higher than the previous plateau.

The current lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility and prevent stockouts (as seen in P39 and P42), I will use the recent 10-period regime (P36-P45) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand environment while accounting for the significant variance observed during this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand surge regime (P36-P45) average confirmed at 173.4 units, with volatility (std dev) of approximately 23.4 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-surge regime that began at Period 36. Evaluating the data from Period 36 to Period 46, the average demand is 173.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. The most recent demand figures (P43: 177, P44: 179, P45: 166, P46: 172) show relative stability within this high regime compared to the volatility observed earlier (e.g., the peak of 223 in Period 42). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N method with N=11 (covering the entire current regime P36-P46) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to maintain high service levels in a high-demand phase with the slightly lower volatility seen in the last few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3990.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-surge, high-volatility regime that began around Period 36. Period 47 saw a significant demand spike to 222 units, causing a complete stockout (selling 210 units). This follows a previous peak of 223 units in Period 42. Since Period 36, the average demand is approximately 177.8 units, but the high volatility (recent peak 222) suggests we must maintain a high base stock to avoid further stockouts in these final periods. The promised lead time of 0 consistently holds. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the most recent 12 periods (P36-P47) to capture this increased demand level and its associated variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand surge regime (P36-P47) confirmed: mean demand 177.8 units, with significant peaks reaching 222-223 units. Volatility remains high, with frequent stockouts when demand exceeds 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2920.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand surge regime since Period 36. Over the last 13 periods (P36-P48), the average demand is 171.9 units. The most recent demand (P48) was 157 units, and P47 was a peak of 222 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is critical to avoid stockouts, which have occurred twice in the last 10 periods when demand exceeded 200 units. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this entire recent regime, and sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=13 periods to account for the sustained high volatility (std dev \u2248 23 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2923.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand surge regime since Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 49, the average demand is 174.4 units, with significant peaks reaching 223 units (e.g., P42, P47). The most recent demand (P48-P49) has been 157 units, which is slightly below the regime average but still significantly higher than the previous plateau. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (approx. 95th percentile). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the entire current high-demand regime from P36-P49) to capture the current mean of 174 and the elevated standard deviation (approx 23 units). This ensures the base stock calculation is robust against further peaks while minimizing stockouts during the final periods. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand surge regime (P36-P49) confirmed: average demand is 174.4 units with recurrent peaks exceeding 220 units (P42, P47). Volatility remains elevated compared to all previous regimes.
