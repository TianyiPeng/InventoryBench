Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Historical demand samples for the first 5 periods are provided: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56. The mean demand across these five samples is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Since promised lead time (L) is 0, the review+lead interval is (1+L) = 1 period. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide the OR backend with the parameters derived from the available sample data immediately, ensuring we order enough to cover the expected demand of ~50 units plus a safety buffer for the first period's execution. L is set to 'default' as we have no reason to suspect a deviation from the promised 0-period lead time yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 61 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), matching the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 50 units (though the historical demand data provided for Period 1 was 30, the 'conclude' message shows actual demand was 50). Looking at historical data (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) and the actual Period 1 demand of 50, the demand seems to be averaging around 50 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this level and set lead time to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. This will help maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin, given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 15 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 50 and 45 (average 47.5), while the provided demand samples (Period 1: 30, Period 2: 49, Period 3: 48, Period 4: 65, Period 5: 56) suggest a slightly higher mean of approximately 49.6 overall, but with a recent upward trend. Specifically, the game history shows actual demand was 50 and 45. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand volatility observed in the game history, while keeping L at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4 (decision phase). Reviewing history: Period 1 demand was 50, Period 2 was 45, and Period 3 saw a jump to 86. Because Period 3 demand (86) exceeded total supply (starting 15 + arrived 40 = 55), we stockouted and lost 31 units of demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To address the demand spike and prevent further stockouts, I need to adjust the parameters. The mean demand of the first three periods is 60.33. However, the last period's jump to 86 suggests a potential shift or volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent mean (60.33) and volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%). My parameters aim to replenish inventory immediately to cover this higher demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean = 49.6). In Period 3, there was a stockout because demand (86) significantly exceeded starting inventory (55), although the demand resolution record for P3 shows demand=86 and the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section specifies Period_3: 48. Reconciling these: the demand samples provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' block (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) are used by the OR backend. However, looking at the 'conclude' messages, actual demand was P1:50, P2:45, P3:86, P4:45. This discrepancy suggests volatility or skewed data. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~50. Given the P3 spike (86), I will use an explicit sigma_hat to ensure a higher service level, as the default calculation across only 5 samples might underestimate the risk of another 80+ demand period. Current on-hand is 35.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The current demand history for chips(Regular) shows values: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean: 49.6, \u03c3: 12.8). In the Game History, we observe that demand reported in 'conclude' messages (50, 45, 86, 45, 57) differs from the statistical samples provided in the prompt (30, 49, 48, 65, 56). I will prioritize the 5 statistical samples provided in the prompt as they represent the underlying demand distribution more directly. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order placed and delivered same-period). Total mean is ~50. Since lead time L=0, (1+L) = 1. I'll use the mean of all 5 samples (49.6) and the standard deviation (12.8) to set parameters. No significant changepoint is detected in these 5 samples, so N=5 (all available samples) is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-6 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrived within the same period they were placed). Demand history shows values: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50. The mean demand is approximately 55.5 units, though Period 3 saw a spike to 86. Given the consistent lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history, as no specific regime shift is evident beyond the single-period spike in Period 3. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock based on the detected mean and volatility while accounting for the immediate arrival timing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown comparative stability following an initial spike in Period 3. Historically, demand across Periods 1-7 (excluding the outlier in Period 3) averages approximately 49.5 units. The outlier in Period 3 (86 units) caused a stockout, suggesting that the inventory policy needs to account for such volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which minimizes the required safety stock compared to longer lead times. Current inventory is 19 units, and with no in-transit orders, we need a fresh order to meet Period 8 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent and relevant demand regime (Periods 4-7, average 50.5), which avoids over-reacting to the Period 3 outlier while remaining responsive to current trends. L will remain at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over periods 1-8 shows a mean of approximately 55.8 units (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64). Period 3 saw a significant spike (86), while Period 8 (64) also exceeded the mean, leading to stockouts in both instances (ending on-hand=0). The current state is On-hand=0 and In-transit=0, meaning we are starting Period 9 with zero inventory. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (arrived same period as ordered). Given the recent stockout in Period 8 and the variability in demand (standard deviation ~13.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the average demand across the available history, ensuring the base stock level targets a safe margin above the 55-60 range to avoid further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against $4 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility over the first 9 periods. Demand samples are: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31. The mean demand is approximately 53 units with a standard deviation of roughly 16. In Period 3 and Period 8, we experienced stockouts because demand exceeded starting on-hand inventory, despite same-day arrivals (lead time = 0). The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed history of demand, as there are no clear sustained regime shifts yet, just high variance. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the observed volatility and minimizes the risk of future stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is 38 units. Reviewing the historical demand from Periods 1 to 10 (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28), the mean demand is 50.6 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. However, there has been a noticeable shift in demand starting from Period 9, where demand dropped from an average of ~56 to ~30 (31 in P9, 28 in P10). While earlier periods (P3, P8) showed spikes leading to stockouts, the most recent trend is lower volatility and lower volume. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent cooling while still accounting for the P8 spike, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a safe buffer against the high historical variance. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-11) confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Therefore, I will use L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no clear seasonal trend from the period labels alone. For Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the last 11 periods, the mean demand is approximately 51.45 units (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64). The last 3 periods (9, 10, 11) had demand values of 31, 28, and 64, showing significant fluctuations. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat captures the overall average (approx 51) to avoid overreacting to either the low sales in P9-10 or the stockout in P11. I will use the default sigma_hat which calculates the standard deviation over the whole history to account for the peak demand of 86 and the lows of 28, ensuring a sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts observed in Periods 3, 8, and 11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods across all 12 periods. The product 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 52.4 units per period with a standard deviation of about 15.6 units. Current on-hand inventory is very low at 2 units, and there are no units in transit. Since L=0, we need to order enough to cover the demand for the current period (Period 13). Over the last 12 periods, demand has fluctuated between 28 and 86. Given the consistent lead time performance, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full range of historical demand while prioritizing the recent trend, ensuring we reach a base stock level that covers the 0.8 service level (profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8) plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (12/12 observations show same-period arrival). Demand remains stable around a mean of 52 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, there was a significant demand spike of 103 units, which far exceeded the recent average of approximately 52. This spike resulted in a stockout (sold 66, ending inventory 0). Analyzing the demand history (samples provided: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56; plus history: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64, 63, 103), the mean is roughly 52.8. However, recent volatility is high. Lead time is reliably 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean while smoothing the recent 103 shock. To protect against another spike and recover from the stockout, I'm setting sigma_hat to explicit (25) to increase the safety stock (z-score for 80% service level is ~0.84, so 0.84*25 \u2248 21 units safety stock). L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 13 (103 units), causing a stockout. L remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend in recent periods. While the overall mean across all periods is approximately 58 units, the last two periods (P13 and P14) saw demand spikes of 103 and 85, respectively, causing stockouts. The last five periods (P10-P14) have an average demand of 68.6. Given the confirmed lead time of 0 (L=0), the system must cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1 period). To address the recent volatility and higher demand levels, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the shift faster than a total average. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased variance seen in the recent spikes (103, 85, 63 vs previous values). This strategy aims to avoid further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio $(4/(4+1)=0.80$ service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13: Recent 2-period demand average is 94 units compared to previous average of 52 units, indicating a sustained increase or high-volatility phase.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 16. Analyzing the demand history, specifically starting from Period 13, there has been a clear regime shift. Demand in Periods 13, 14, and 15 were 103, 85, and 85 respectively, resulting in a recent mean demand of 91 units (significantly higher than the earlier average of ~52). This shift has led to stockouts in Periods 13 and 14 because the base stock was not adjusted quickly enough. Lead time is reliably 0 based on all previous 15 periods. For Period 16, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this new elevated demand level and the associated volatility. This will ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current 90+ unit demand regime while maintaining a zero lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: 3-period average is 91 units (Period 13-15), representing a ~75% increase from the previous baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 13. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P13-P16) is 88 units (103, 85, 85, 79), compared to the previous average of approximately 52 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To account for this sustained higher demand level and the resulting stockouts in P13 and P14, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new mean. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current volatility in this higher regime. On-hand inventory is currently 21 units with no pipeline, so the OR engine will place an order to reach the new base stock level targeting 88+ units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: 4-period mean (P13-P16) is 88 units, a ~70% increase over the original baseline. High demand is sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Analysis of the demand history reveals a clear regime shift that began in Period 13. Demand samples prior to Period 13 (seed data + P1-P12) averaged 52 units, whereas the demand from Period 13 to Period 17 (103, 85, 85, 79, 104) has jumped to a mean of 91.2 units (an ~75% increase). Despite increasing our orders, we stocked out again in Period 17 due to a demand of 104 units. To respond to this sustained increase, I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand data. The lead time (L) is consistently observed as 0 periods (same-period arrival), so 'default' (promised lead time 0) or 'calculate' are both appropriate; I will use 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: 5-period mean (P13-P17) is 91.2 units, representing a sustained ~75% increase from the original baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 13. The original baseline mean (Periods 1-12) was approximately 52.9 units. Since Period 13, demand has consistently been higher: P13 (103), P14 (85), P15 (85), P16 (79), P17 (104), and P18 (96). The 6-period mean for this new regime is 92 units, which is roughly 74% higher than the previous period. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on 18 consecutive same-period arrivals. To capture this sustained shift, I will use recent_N with N=6 (the length of the new regime) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand level. L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: 6-period mean (P13-P18) is 92.0 units, a sustained ~74% increase from the original baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 13. The original baseline average (P1-P12) was approximately 52 units, while the subsequent average (P13-P19) has risen to approximately 95 units, representing an ~83% increase. The most recent demand (P19) reached a new peak of 114 units, resulting in a stockout. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering the period from the shift at P13 to P19). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level and high volatility, minimizing further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: 7-period mean (P13-P19) is 95.1 units, an ~83% increase from the original baseline. Peak demand observed at Period 19 (114 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 13 is firmly established and appears to be continuing its upward trend. The last 8 periods (P13-P20) show a mean demand of approximately 97.75 units (103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96, 114, 116). The two most recent periods (P19 and P20) reached peak levels of 114 and 116 units, suggesting the regime might be stabilizing at an even higher plateau or continuing to grow. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on 20 consecutive observations of same-period arrival. To prevent the stockouts observed in P17, P19, and P20, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture this higher-demand regime specifically. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the current high-demand environment (~98 units per period) while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 stabilized at higher levels: 8-period mean (P13-P20) is 97.75 units. Recent demand in P19-P20 reached 115 units average, indicating potential further escalation or high volatility within the new regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 13. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), the mean demand has increased to approximately 99.6 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~52 units. The last three periods (P19-P21) show even higher sustained demand (114, 116, 114), suggesting the regime might be stabilizing at a peak or continuing to escalate. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a series of stockouts (P19, P20, P21), indicating that the previous order levels Were insufficient to cover the upside volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To address the higher demand and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the full shift since Period 13, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This will raise the base stock level to better handle the current demand levels (approx 115 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 stabilized at a high level: 9-period mean (P13-P21) is 99.6 units. The most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) show consistency at 114-116 units, indicating the current peak demand level.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 13 continues to escalate. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have shown demand levels of 116, 114, and 123 units respectively, with an average of approximately 117 units. This is a significant increase over the previous average of ~95 identified in Period 20. The current on-hand inventory is 0 for the fourth consecutive period, indicating that the OR backend's default parameters (based on a longer history) are consistently under-ordering for this new peak. To address this, I am setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire high-demand regime from Period 13 to Period 22 (10 samples) accurately while excluding the lower-demand baseline from before Period 13. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders within the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 further escalated: 10-period mean (P13-P22) is 102 units. Recent 3-period demand (P20-P22) average is 117.7 units, suggesting a potential new peak level above 115.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 13 and has continued to escalate. The original baseline (~52 units) has been replaced by a much higher demand level. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 19-23), demand has stabilized at a peak level, with observations of 114, 116, 114, 123, and 117. The average over these last 5 periods is approximately 116.8 units. The system is currently frequenting stockouts (on-hand 0 for the last four periods) because the OR backend's order cap and base stock calculations are lagging behind this rapid growth. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on 23 consecutive observations of same-period arrival. To prevent further lost sales and capture the new demand ceiling, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this stabilized peak regime (P19-P23).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 has stabilized at a new peak level: 5-period mean (P19-P23) is 116.8 units, representing a 125% increase from the original baseline. Stockouts persist due to rapid escalation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a massive surge in Period 24, jumping to 174 units from the previous peak of 123 units. This suggests the demand regime shift that began at Period 13 is either accelerating or entering a highly volatile seasonal peak. The previous 5-period mean (P19-P23) was ~117 units, but the Period 24 observation is ~50% higher than that average. Given the critical stockout in Period 24 (sold 120, demand 174), I must aggressively adjust parameters to prevent further lost sales. I am shifting to a very recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this sudden spike, and I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of recent high-demand periods 114, 116, 114, 123, 117, 174 is approx 23). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on 24 consecutive periods of same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated sharply at Period 24: Demand jumped to 174 units, a ~50% increase over the previous 5-period peak average of 117 units. Stockouts persist as demand outpaces recent forecasts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with a major escalation starting at Period 13 and a massive spike to 174 units at Period 24. While Period 25 demand dropped back to 115, the recent trend remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. The average demand from Period 19 to Period 25 (the most recent high-demand cluster) is approximately 125 units (114, 116, 114, 123, 117, 174, 115). Specifically, the 2-period average (P24-P25) is 144.5, and the 5-period average (P21-P25) is 128.6. Given the high volatility and the potential for demand to spike back towards the 170+ range, I will use a N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-level baseline (approx 128.6 per period) while maintaining high responsiveness to volatility via sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high: after a peak of 174 in Period 24, Period 25 returned to 115. Recent 5-period mean (P21-P25) is 128.6 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and an upward trend, with Period 26 demand hitting 160 units, following a peak of 174 in Period 24. We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 13 and escalated further at Period 24. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Despite increasing orders, we stocked out again in Period 26 (sold 151, demand 160). To capture the current heightened state and high volatility, I am using a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat based on the most recent escalation (P23-P26: 117, 174, 115, 160; mean ~141.5). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to include the major jump in Period 24, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to buffer against these 160+ peaks while acknowledging the lead time is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated again at Period 24: 3-period mean (P24-P26) is 149.7 units, compared to the previous peak average of ~117. High volatility persists with swings between 115 and 174 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, starting at a baseline of ~52 (P1-P12), moving to ~95 (P13-P22), and most recently escalating to a highly volatile peak regime starting at P24. The last four periods (P24-P27) show demand of 174, 115, 160, and 141 (mean 147.5, std ~25.2). Stockouts have been frequent because demand has consistently outperformed the orders based on previous averages. Lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand/high-volatility regime, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent regime (P24-P27) to ensure base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 147.5 mean plus a safety buffer for the high variance (std ~25), preventing further lost sales while recognizing the high service level requirement (Critical Ratio ~0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated again at Period 24: 4-period mean (P24-P27) is 147.5 units, with significantly increased volatility (values ranging from 115 to 174). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a highly volatile high-demand regime that began at Period 24. A review of the most recent samples (P24: 174, P25: 115, P26: 160, P27: 141, P28: 100) shows a mean of 138 units with a very high standard deviation (approx 30.8). Although Period 28 saw a dip to 100, the overall trend since Period 24 is 138, which is a significant step up from the Period 19-23 average of ~117. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and high variance while protecting against stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the period from the P24 shift). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the mean and volatility of this latest volatile regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted again at Period 24: 5-period mean (P24-P28) is 138 units (range 100-174). Volatility has increased significantly during this phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first at Period 13 (shifting the mean to ~95-100) and then a more volatile escalation starting at Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand has fluctuated significantly between 100 and 174 units. The the 6-period mean (P24-P29) is approx 139.5 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 27-30 in this recent regime) and the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a target service level of 80%), I need to set parameters that capture this recent high-demand, high-volatility phase without over-reacting to the single 174 peak. I will use the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6). This covers the most recent shift while still providing enough samples to estimate variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: 6-period mean (P24-P29) is 139.5 units with high volatility (range 100-174). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first around Period 13 and more significantly at Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has exhibited high mean (approx 139) and high volatility, with values ranging from 100 to 174. The most recent demand was 137. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent high-volatility regime starting at Period 24, I am using a recent_N approach with N=7 (covering Periods 24-30). This allows the OR backend to calculate the mean and standard deviation from the most relevant data points. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. This configuration aims to provide enough base stock to meet the high and variable demand while accounting for the same-period delivery capability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: 7-period mean (P24-P30) is 139.1 units (range 100-174), reflecting persistent high volatility and an increased baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $614.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 24, moving from a mean of ~117 to a higher, more volatile state averaging ~141 over the last 8 periods (P24-P31). Demand has fluctuated significantly between 100 and 174. In Period 31, demand was 155, which is above the average of the current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the sustained increase and high volatility since Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (1+L) demand requirement while allowing the OR backend to calculate the safety stock based on the high variance observed in this specific window. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units), so a fresh order based on these updated regime parameters is necessary to prevent a stockout in Period 32.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: 8-period mean (P24-P31) is 141.1 units (range 100-174). Local volatility is significantly higher than previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 24 to a higher mean and significantly increased volatility. The most recent 9 periods (P24-P32) display a mean of 139.8 units with a range of 100 to 174. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent during this high-demand phase. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's characteristics while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~22 in the recent segment), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 for both Mu and Sigma. This will base the order on the average demand since the last major escalation and provide a safety buffer suitable for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: 9-period mean (P24-P32) is 139.8 units (range 100-174), with significantly elevated volatility compared to the P13-P23 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first around Period 13 and more significantly at Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has stabilized at a higher mean with increased volatility, ranging from 100 to 174. The mean demand from Period 24 to Period 33 (10 samples) is approximately 143.9 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Given the high volatility in this current regime (std dev \u2248 23), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this latest regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~144) plus a safety buffer for the observed variance. Using 10 samples balances responsiveness to the recent shift with enough data to estimate the increased volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 24, moving from a mean of ~117 to a more volatile state with an average around 140 units. Over the last 11 periods (P24-P34), the mean demand is 136.5 units, with a peak of 174 and a trough of 100. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current period (Period 35) follows the same pattern, I will use a N=11 window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific high-volatility regime. This window covers all data points from the Period 24 shift to the present. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the high variance (std dev ~22) and ensures a high service level given the unit profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 has stabilized with a mean of ~137 and high standard deviation (~22), with values ranging from 100 to 174 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift at Period 24, moving from a mean of ~102 to a higher and more volatile state. Observations from Period 24 to 35 show a mean of approximately 137.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For the current decision (Period 36), the available on-hand inventory is 13 units. To capture the current heightened demand and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the entire current regime from Period 24 to 35). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~137) and significant volatility, maintaining a high service level given the high profit margin ($4 profit vs. $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 remains stable in its new high-demand state: 12-period mean (P24-P35) is 137.3 units with standard deviation of 22.1, ranging from 100 to 174 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods through 35 observations.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-volatility phase that began at Period 24. Since then (P24-P36), the mean demand is approximately 137 units with a standard deviation of roughly 22 units. Recently, demand has peaked again at 162 in Period 36, causing a stockout. To respond to this high-demand, high-volatility state while minimizing future stockouts, I will use a N=13 window (covering the Period 24-36 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most representative mean and variability for the current state. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed across 36 observations), so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $632.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. For Period 37, demand was 171 units, continuing a trend of high-demand spikes (P36: 162, P37: 171). The current inventory is 0. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher demand level and the associated volatility, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=14 (covering Period 24 to 37) to capture the current mean of approximately 140 units. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=14 to reflect the significantly increased variance observed in this regime (from 100 to 174 range), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 continues to show high-demand spikes, with the last two periods (P36-P37) averaging 166.5 units, which is at the upper end of the established 100-174 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $644.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand has averaged approximately 139 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~22, range 100-174). Recent demand in Periods 36-38 has been particularly strong (162, 171, 161), averaging 164.7 units, which is near the historical peak. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the sustained high demand and recent spike, I will use recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current regime starting at P24 (15 samples available from P24 to P38) and provides a robust estimate for the elevated mean and the increased volatility. In a 0-lead time environment, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period (1+0 review cycle). Providing a slightly higher mu_hat through recent averages helps mitigate the risk of stockouts during these peak demand phases.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 remains at a high baseline: 15-period mean (P24-P38) is 139.1 units. Recent 3-period demand (P36-P38) shows a cluster at the upper bound, averaging 164.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, demand surged to 200 units, significantly exceeding the previous peak of 174 units and the recent 16-period average of ~139 units. This represents another potential regime shift or a massive spike at the end of the current high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (39/39 observations). Since demand reached a new all-time high of 200 and has caused another stockout, I must adjust the forecast to capture this escalation. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat to weigh the latest surge (P37: 171, P38: 161, P39: 200; average ~177) more heavily while providing some smoothing. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to account for the heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 20 at this level). This ensures the base stock calculation targets a high enough level to prevent further stockouts in this new volatility peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Demand reached a new peak of 200 units, indicating a potential further escalation from the Period 24 baseline (~140 units). Recent 3-period average is 177.3 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent escalation starting at Period 39, where demand hit a new peak of 200 units. The previous high-demand regime (P24-P38) averaged ~140 units, but recent demand (P36-P40) has trended upwards (162, 171, 161, 200, 145) with a 5-period mean of 167.8 units. The observation from Period 40 (145 units) suggests that while the 200-unit spike may be an outlier, the baseline remains significantly higher than the P24 average. Lead time is reliably 0 periods based on 40 consecutive observations. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher baseline while maintaining sufficient inventory to cover potential spikes up to 200 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to account for the elevated volatility in this new demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Demand reached a peak of 200, and the 5-period average (P36-P40) is 167.8 units, compared to the previous ~140 average. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 39, where demand spiked to 200 units. The 5-period average (P37-P41) is approximately 165.4 units, confirming a significantly higher baseline and volatility compared to the Period 24-35 average (~137 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on 41 observations. To capture the current high-demand state while accounting for recent fluctuations (ranging from 145 to 200 in the last 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the mean of the current regime (~165) and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current peak demand levels while the 0 lead time allows for rapid adjustment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: 3-period mean (P39-P41) is 165 units, with a peak of 200. This follows the P24-P38 regime average of ~139 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again, confirmed by a significant spike of 223 units in Period 42. While previous periods (P39-P41) averaged around 165 units, the Period 42 observation of 223 suggests a new upper bound or a further escalation in demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (all 42 orders to date arrived in the period they were placed). To capture this latest escalation while acknowledging high volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This focuses on the Period 39-42 window (demand: 200, 145, 150, 223), resulting in a mean demand of 179.5 units. With profit=$4 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a high service level. Current on-hand is 0, so the backend will order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalated significantly at Period 42 with a peak of 223 units. The 4-period mean (P39-P42) is now 179.5 units, compared to the previous ~140 unit baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $673.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. After the Period 24 escalation (avg ~140), a new shift occurred at Period 39. The most recent demand samples are Period 39: 200, Period 40: 145, Period 41: 150, Period 42: 223, and Period 43: 177. The mean of these last five periods (P39-P43) is 179 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline. Volatility has also spiked, with demand ranging from 145 to 223. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by 43 consecutive same-period arrivals. To capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime while protecting against stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most relevant data post-Period 39. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean of 179 and the increased standard deviation, which is approximately 32 units for these 5 samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed and further escalated: 5-period mean (P39-P43) is 179.0 units, with high volatility (range 145-223). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent escalation starting at Period 39. The 6-period mean from Period 39 to Period 44 is approximately 179 units (200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179), compared to the previous Period 24-38 baseline of ~140. Volatility has also increased significantly, with demand ranging from 145 to 223 in this new phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. To capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime and prevent stockouts (as seen in Period 42), I will use the recent 6 periods (P39-P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets the new baseline mean of ~179 and accounts for the increased standard deviation (approx 29 in this window), balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: 6-period mean (P39-P44) is 179.0 units with high volatility (range 145-223). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 39, followed by a significant spike at Period 42 (223 units). The most recent 7 periods (P39-P45) show a mean of 177.1 units (values: 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166) with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. This is a clear escalation from the previous P24-P38 average of ~139. Lead time is consistently 0 (45/45 observations). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Given the high criticality (profit $4 vs holding cost $1), target service level z* is \u03a6\u22121(0.8) \u2248 0.84. Using recent samples ensures the base stock covers current volatility and avoids the stockouts observed during the transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: 7-period mean (P39-P45) is 177.1 units (range 145-223), representing an ~28% increase over the P24-P38 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $659.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 39. The average demand across the most recent 8 periods (P39-P46) is approximately 176.5 units, with a peak of 223 units in Period 42. Since Period 39, demand has consistently stayed above 145, averaging 176.5, which is a significant increase from the ~140 unit baseline observed in the previous regime (P24-P38). Lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed through 46 periods). To account for this higher stabilized demand and the associated volatility (std dev approx 25 in this new regime), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the latest regime's mean (P39-P46) and 'recent_N' with N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility levels. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the 175-180 unit average while maintaining a safety buffer for the 200+ spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 stabilized: 8-period mean (P39-P46) is 176.5 units, representing a 26% increase over the previous P24-P38 baseline (~140). High volatility persists with a local peak of 223.

Daily Reward (R_t): $792.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced several regime shifts, with the most recent sustained escalation beginning at Period 39. Since and including Period 39, the mean demand is approximately 181 units (based on P39-P47 history: 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179, 166, 172, 222). There is significant volatility in this new regime, with three separate peaks exceeding 200 units (P39: 200, P42: 223, P47: 222). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Despite this, stockouts occurred in Period 47 because demand (222) exceeded the order plus on-hand inventory. To capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=9 (covering P39-P47). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest ~181 mean and the increased standard deviation (~28) rather than the lower historical averages, allowing the OR backend to set a higher base stock and prevent further stockouts in the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 confirmed: 9-period mean (P39-P47) is ~181 units, with recurring peaks above 200 (range 145-223). Volatility remains high.

Daily Profit: $628.00, Daily Holding Cost: $49.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $579.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a significantly higher baseline starting from Period 39. The mean demand for this recent period (P39-P48) is 179.1 units with a range of 145-223 units. Lead time analysis consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods (order arrives same-day). Given that we are at Period 49 (nearly the end of the simulation), the objective is to satisfy this high demand while accounting for the high volatility (std dev ~26.5 during this last phase). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to precisely capture this current high-demand regime, ensuring we set a base stock that covers the potential for another peak near 223 units while maximizing profit against holding costs.

Daily Profit: $628.00, Daily Holding Cost: $46.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $582.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 39 to a higher baseline (~180 units) with persistent volatility and recurring peaks over 200. Lead time is consistently 0. In Period 49, demand was 157, continuing the trend. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (covering Period 39 to 49) to capture this current regime's mean (approx 178). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=11 to reflect the high local volatility observed in this period, where demand ranges significantly from 145 to 223. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against these frequent spikes while acknowledging the same-day lead time.
