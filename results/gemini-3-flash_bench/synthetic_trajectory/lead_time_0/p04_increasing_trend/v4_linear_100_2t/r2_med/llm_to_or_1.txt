Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical arrival data and five historical demand samples [75, 90, 0, 170, 127]. The average demand across these five samples is 92.4, but the zero in Period 3 suggests high volatility or a data artifact. The promised lead time is 0. My goal for Period 1 is to establish a baseline. Since I have no 'conclude' messages yet to verify actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L (which defaults to the promised lead time of 0). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full historical context provided, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the high variance observed (0 to 170). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time demand plus a safety stock buffer based on the observed fluctuations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the order of 146 units arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), meeting the promised lead time. The demand of 132 in Period 1 was significantly higher than the initial historical samples (which averaged ~92), and Period 2 demand is now known to be 90 (from the provided history). However, looking at the full historical sequence provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), there is high volatility. With an on-hand inventory of 14 units and a promised lead time of 0, I need to ensure the base stock covers the mean demand plus a safety buffer. Given the jump to 132 and 170 in the full data set, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent levels. Since we only have 2 periods of active game play but 5 historical samples total, I will use recent_N=5 to average the historical data provided in the prompt (Avg = 92.4). Lead time appears stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 59 units. Historically, the demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 132 and 100 respectively. The provided sample data for Period 3 shows 0 demand, which contradicts the 'History' section if we were already at the conclusion, but since we are at the START of Period 3's decision phase, we must look ahead. Based on the provided demand history (P1: 75, P2: 90, P3: 0, P4: 170, P5: 127) and the actual concluding history (P1: 132, P2: 100), there is high volatility. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 concluding messages. To ensure we cover potential demand for Period 3 and Period 4 (anticipating the jump to 170 seen in the samples), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent actual realized demand (avg 116) more heavily than the earlier samples, while keeping L at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 3 concluded periods (P1, P2, P3). Demand appears highly volatile with recent historical samples of 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127. The most recent three recorded demands (calculated from history) are 132, 100, and 80, showing a downward trend, while the sample data provided for Period 4 and 5 suggests a spike. To handle this volatility and avoid stockouts during high demand periods, I am using recent demand samples (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent declining trend observed in concluded periods against the general variability of the product.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked significantly to 221 units, exhausting all on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. The historical demand sequence (132, 100, 80, 221, 127) suggests a regime shift or high volatility. While the mean of all periods is 132, the most recent values (221, 127) indicate we need to buffer for higher demand. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand trend while maintaining a slightly wider safety stock via default sigma_hat to account for the Period 4 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observed a demand of 70, which follows a major demand spike in Period 4 (221). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 in the provided summary, though the conclude messages show demand as 132, 100, 80, 221, 70). The average demand over the 5 periods is approximately 120.6. There is no clear sustained regime shift yet, but Period 4 suggests the potential for high-impact stockouts if we carry too little inventory. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. We will use a baseline mean and account for the high variance to ensure sufficient safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full volatility of the initial period while reacting to the most recent data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 100 with zero units in transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility, ranging from 70 to 221 (Period 4 saw a spike to 221 which led to stockouts). Actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. Given the high variance and the stockout in Period 4, I will use recent demand history to set parameters. Demand for the last 6 periods averages ~112.5, but the spike in Period 4 suggests the need for a robust safety stock. I'll use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and mean demand while maintaining L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand dropped significantly to 6 units, which is much lower than the historical average (approx. 100). The current on-hand inventory is 156 units, which is high compared to recent demand levels. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders P1-P7 arrived in the same period). Given the high volatility (sigma) and the recent outlier (P7: 6 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent downward shift while still acknowledging the high demand in Period 4. This approach will naturally lower the base stock calculation, preventing excessive ordering while on-hand inventory is high. L will remain 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $478.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 6 to 221. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held across all 8 completed periods. In Period 4, we experienced a stockout due to a demand spike (221). While the recent average (Periods 1-8) is approximately 101 units per period, the standard deviation is significant. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a high service level. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (30 units) with nothing in-transit. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (the full available history) to capture the base demand mean and volatility while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. This ensures we recover from the low inventory state while accounting for the high demand variance observed in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm a 0-period lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear regime shift or seasonal pattern in the provided period numbers (P1: 132, P2: 100, P3: 80, P4: 221, P5: 70, P6: 72, P7: 6, P8: 127, P9: 3). The average demand across all 9 periods is approximately 90.1. Current on-hand inventory is 151. Given the high volatility (standard deviation of ~64.5), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data for a robust base-stock calculation. This will help the OR engine set a safety stock level that accounts for the frequent low-demand periods (P7, P9) and the intermittent high-demand spikes (P4, P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been highly volatile over the first 10 periods, ranging from 3 to 221 units. The average demand across all periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 84 units, but significant spikes (e.g., Period 4: 221, Period 8: 127) and drops (e.g., Period 7: 6, Period 9: 3) suggest a high variance. The stockout in Period 4 indicates that the system needs to be more responsive to these fluctuations. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, I will maintain 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to prioritize the most recent historical behavior (Periods 1-10) while still keeping enough sample size to account for the variance observed in the game thus far. This should allow the OR engine to set a base stock that better buffers against the high standard deviation seen in the recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' exhibit significant volatility, with recent demand in Period 11 (209 units) and Period 4 (221 units) spiking far above the historical average (approx. 99 units). The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders, confirming that 'lead_time=0' is stable. Given the high variance and recent stockout in Period 11, I will use a larger sample size (N=11) to stabilize the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the backend captures the full historical range of the demand distribution, including the high-demand spikes, to provide sufficient safety stock (z* is high since Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1) and prevent further stockouts in Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is highly volatile, with values ranging from 3 to 221. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm that orders placed within a period consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There is a pattern of demand spikes (e.g., P4: 221, P11: 209). In Period 12, an order of 159 arrived, but demand was 85, leaving an ending inventory of 74. Since lead time is zero, the 'base stock' essentially covers only the current period's demand (L+1=1). Using the mean of all historical samples (approx. 92) would under-prepare for the frequent spikes. However, setting L=0 simplifies the OR backend logic. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since evidence consistently shows 0. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use all available data (default) to capture the high variance while maintaining a reasonable service level to mitigate stockout risks during spikes without excessive holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The stock is currently at zero after demand exceeded supply in Period 13. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility (ranging from 3 to 221) without a clear trend or regime shift. The average demand across all historical data (including seed samples) is approximately 96 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missing shipments. Given the zero on-hand inventory and the High-Profit-High-Volatility nature of the SKU, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=13 to capture the full recent history since Period 1 while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a 0-period lead time environment (looking ahead to cover Demand in Period 14). This approach aims to maximize service level for potential demand spikes while accounting for the high holding cost relative to the profit ($1 holding vs $4 profit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-160.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) exhibits high volatility with frequent stockouts (Periods 4, 11, 13) and periods of near-zero demand (Periods 9, 14). Specifically, Period 4 (221), Period 11 (209), and Period 13 (166) are significant spikes. The average demand across all periods (including the provided samples) is approximately 102 units, but the standard deviation is high (~65). Given the critical shortage risks observed in periods 11 and 13, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher activity while maintaining a robust safety stock via standard sigma calculation. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed, so I will continue using the default lead time (0). Inventory is currently at 160, but since the lead time is 0, the backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock within this same period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or structural trend in the provided period history (N=15). Demand has fluctuated between 0 and 221 units. The average demand across all periods is approximately 99.3 units, but the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show a slightly higher average of 115.8 units compared to the first 10. However, given the zero demand in P14 and high volatility, using a broader sample for mu_hat (N=10) provides a more stable forecast while capturing recent levels. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is favorable for reacting to these demand spikes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to capture this recent volatility while smoothing out extreme outliers like Period 14 (demand: 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear seasonal or regime shift trend in the last few periods (P11=209, P12=85, P13=166, P14=0, P15=119, P16=185). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 107 units, while the all-time mean is approximately 105. Given the stockout in Period 16 (sold 146 out of 185 demanded), we need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover high-variance demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variance while smoothing out the zero-demand outlier in Period 14. Lead time calculation remains at default (promising 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and recent significant spikes. Over the last 17 periods, the average demand is approximately 109 units, but recent demand in Period 17 jumped to 297, following 185 in Period 16. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent. My current on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during these high-demand periods, I need to adjust the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent upward trend and volatility (averaging 123 in the last 7 periods, vs 109 overall). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased variance observed in recent periods (0, 119, 185, 297), which helps the OR backend set a more appropriate safety stock level to meet the high service level target (implied by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly from Period 11 onwards, with frequent spikes exceeding 180 units (Periods 11, 13, 16, 17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand was 58, following a massive spike of 297 in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 174 units. Historical data indicates a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 11, characterized by high volatility and frequent large spikes (209, 166, 185, 297). The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is approximately 140 units, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 105 units. Given the high stockout frequency in this recent regime, I will use a N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased mean and variance more accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P11: mean increased to ~140 with high volatility (multiple spikes > 180). This pattern has sustained for 8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 11, moving from a lower-volume baseline to a high-volatility environment with frequent spikes (e.g., P11: 209, P16: 185, P17: 297). The last two periods (P18: 58, P19: 76) show a temporary cooling, but the high-volatility regime (P11-P19) persists as the dominant trend to plan for. I am using recent_N (N=9, covering P11 to P19) for both mean and standard deviation to capture this newer, higher-risk distribution. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 144, and by targeting a base stock derived from the recent volatile regime (Mean ~120, Std ~90), the OR backend will calculate an order that provides sufficient safety stock to cover potential spikes without excessive holding costs, as the critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) favors a reasonably high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 20 spiked exceptionally to 420 units, far exceeding the previously observed regime mean of ~140. Looking at the history (Periods 11-20), we see a high-volatility environment with frequent spikes (209, 166, 185, 297, 420). The high volume at Period 20 suggests either a temporary peak or a further upward shift in demand regime. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. With on-hand inventory currently at 0, I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture these large spikes. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher mean and elevated variance characteristic of the regime since Period 11, while using an 'explicit' L of 0 to match the consistent observed lead time of 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Extreme demand spike of 420 units observed in Period 20; demand regime since Period 11 is characterized by high variance and frequent spikes > 180 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 11, with recent periods showing extreme spikes (Period 17: 297, Period 20: 420, Period 21: 263). The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units), making it critical to set parameters that can absorb these large bursts while the lead time remains 0. I will use recent_N with N=11 (from Period 11 to 21) to capture this higher mean and significantly increased variance. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 161.8, and the standard deviation has increased drastically due to the outliers. By focusing on this recent window, mu_hat and sigma_hat will better represent the current risk of stockouts during these volatile bursts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $571.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 11, moving away from low-volume/low-variance demand to a highly volatile regime with frequent extreme spikes (e.g., Period 11: 209, Period 17: 297, Period 20: 420). The last three periods show demands of 420, 263, and 169. This volatility requires a higher service level and a focus on recent data to capture the elevated mean and standard deviation. I am using recent_N=12 to focus on the data since the Period 11 shift (12 periods including Period 22). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as seen in the 'conclude' messages. By using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will calculate a higher base stock to protect against the frequent stockouts observed in periods 11, 13, 16, 17, and 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shifted significantly, characterized by high volatility and a higher mean. Recent demand values are: P21 (263), P22 (169), and P23 (201). The extreme event in P20 (420) combined with these recent figures confirms that the average demand is now substantially higher than the historical average from the first 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this shift while accounting for the high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the P11 shift). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to account for the increased standard deviation observed in this new regime, ensuring the service level target (approximately 80% based on profit/holding cost) is met without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 23 confirms a sustained higher mean (~178) and significantly higher volatility compared to Period 1-10.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 11. Analysis of lead times confirms the actual lead time (L) remains 0. From P11 to P24, the demand has a mean of approximately 177.3 units and a standard deviation of approximately 107.5. Recent demand in Period 24 was 125, slightly lower than the regime mean. Setting N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this high-volatility regime starting from Period 11, which includes extreme spikes (e.g., Period 20's demand of 420) and periods of low demand (e.g., Period 14's demand of 0). The base stock policy with these parameters will help the OR backend set a target levels that buffers against the high variance while optimizing for the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/($4+$1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shown a significant increase in both mean and volatility compared to the first 10 periods. Specifically, the mean demand from P11 to P25 is approximately 164 units, with a very high standard deviation (approx 105 units) due to frequent spikes (e.g., P20 with 420 units, P17 with 297 units). The critical decision point here is managing the bullwhip effect after a very low demand period (P25 demand = 35), which left us with a high ending inventory of 226 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a 0.8 critical fractile), we should maintain a robust base stock that accounts for these frequent spikes. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 (covering the entire current regime since P11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher mean and volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 25 confirms a sustained higher mean (approx 164) and high volatility (StdDev approx 105) with frequent spikes exceeding 250 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shown a significant increase in both mean and volatility compared to the first 10 periods. Analysis of demand from Period 11 to 26 (16 samples) shows a mean of approximately 161.8 with a standard deviation of 102.5. Recent volatility remains high, with frequent spikes exceeding 250 units (e.g., P17, P20, P21). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high variance and prevent stockouts seen in earlier periods of this regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture the current demand distribution accurately. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock level that accounts for the observed spikes while considering the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to exhibit high mean (~160-170 units) and extreme volatility, with spikes frequently exceeding 200 units (max 420 in P20, 207 in P27). The most recent 17 periods (P11-P27) represent this high-variance regime. Setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations captures this sustained shift while ignoring the quieter first 10 periods. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to 'default'. Current on-hand is low (41), so the service-level-driven base stock logic will trigger a substantial order to protect against a possible high-demand spike in Period 28.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from a low-mean/low-variance state to a high-mean/high-variance state. Analysis of the demand from Period 11 through Period 28 shows a persistent average of approximately 174 units per period with significant volatility and spikes (e.g., P20 at 420, P21 at 263, P28 at 221). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. For Period 29, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=18 (covering the entire current high-demand regime from P11 to P28) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased average demand and the frequent large spikes to maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 28 sustains a higher mean (approx 174) and remains highly volatile with frequent spikes exceeding 200 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has consistently shown a higher mean and significant volatility compared to the initial 10 periods. Recent demand (Periods 11-29) averages approximately 166 units per period, but includes frequent, high-impact spikes (e.g., 209, 297, 420, 263, 207, 221). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the high volatility (standard deviation > 100 in the recent regime), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=19 (matching the length of the current regime starting from Period 11) to capture both the elevated mean and the necessary buffer for significant demand swings. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to mitigate the risk of stockouts during spikes while recognizing the zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $980.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand spiked to 305 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Since Period 11, the demand has been in a high-volatility regime with a higher mean and frequent spikes exceeding 250 units (e.g., P17: 297, P20: 420, P30: 305). The current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. I will continue to use the recent regime (last 20 periods, from P11 to P30) to capture this increased mean and high variance. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that accounts for the high-service-level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) to prevent stockouts during these frequent spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1020.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile and high-volume regime. Period 31 saw a massive spike of 509 units, which significantly exceeded the inventory provided by the previous period's order. This follows a pattern of increasing spikes (420 in Period 20, 305 in Period 30, and now 509 in Period 31). The mean demand since the major shift at Period 11 is approximately 172, but the standard deviation is very high (around 120). To capture this high-risk environment and minimize stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=20 to focus on this volatile regime (P11-P31). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend's 'cap' mechanism might limit orders based on historical averages, using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the higher mean and variance observed over the last 20 periods, rather than the lower-demand early periods (P1-P10). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme volatility and demand escalation: Period 31 reached a record high demand of 509 units; demand regime from Period 11 onwards now shows a mean of ~172 and StdDev of ~120, frequently depleting stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and high mean shifts, specifically since Period 11. The most recent sequence of demands (Period 27-32) highlights this instability: 207, 221, 98, 305, 509, and 9. Period 31 saw a record high of 509 units, while Period 32 dropped to 9 units. Given the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the target service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high variance and recent upward trend without overreacting to the single low data point in Period 32, I am using a recent regime window starting from Period 20 (N=13) to capture the current high-volatility stage. This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock to cover frequent spikes (like the 509 seen in P31) while balancing the holding cost from low periods (like the 9 seen in P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently higher and more volatile than the initial 10 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 177 units and a standard deviation of roughly 130. Recent spikes (e.g., P31 reaching 509 units) highlight the need for a higher base stock to avoid stockouts. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the significant shift and high variability, I am using a recent window (N=23, from P11 to P33) to capture the current regime's statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the more aggressive mean and volatility estimates relevant to the current market environment while maintaining the responsiveness afforded by a zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1112.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been characterized by high mean (~174) and extreme volatility (StdDev ~120). Recent periods show significant spikes (P31: 509, P34: 357), leading to stockouts despite increased base stock. The current ending inventory is 0, with 0 in-transit, indicating an urgent need to restock. To address the persistent high volatility and the loss of sales in Period 34, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering the regime since Period 11). This provides a more responsive estimate of the current high-demand, high-variance environment compared to a full-history average. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical 'conclude' messages. By setting Mu and Sigma based on the last 24 periods, the OR engine will calculate a base stock that better accounts for the frequent spikes and maintains a higher service level to capture the profit of $4.0 vs a $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: High volatility regime since Period 11 remains active; Period 34 saw a major spike (357 units) causing a stockout, confirming the need for high safety stock levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a confirmed regime shift since Period 11. Recent data shows significant spikes, including a record 509 units in Period 31 and 357 units in Period 34, often leading to stockouts. The mean demand since the P11 shift is approximately 173 units with a standard deviation near 118. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this high-volatility regime and prevent the stockouts observed in P30, P31, and P34, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=20 to cover the majority of the current high-demand state. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that reflects the recent increased mean and variance, ensuring a higher service level to maximize profit despite the high volume of spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean that began around Period 11. Recent periods show significant spikes (P31: 509, P34: 357, P36: 284), often leading to stockouts. The promised lead time remains 0, and all shipments have arrived within the same period (L=0). To capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime, I am using a recent window of N=26 (from P11 to P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window effectively excludes the lower-demand Period 1-10 regime while encompassing the full range of recent volatility. Given the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the OR backend's safety stock calculation should appropriately buffer against these spikes if provided with the correct regime statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent large spikes (e.g., Period 31 at 509 units, Period 34 at 357 units). Since Period 11, the demand regime has shifted to a higher mean and significantly higher variance. I am using recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high-volatility regime while filtering out the much lower demand seen in the first 10 periods. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so I'm using the 'calculate' method to maintain this estimate. The ending inventory of 189 units follows a period with 100 demand; with a 0 lead time, the OR parameter logic will target a base stock that covers the high-variance forecast, ensuring we are prepared for the next potential spike while considering the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1208.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with frequent high-magnitude spikes, the most recent being a demand of 326 units in Period 38, resulting in a stockout. Since the regime shift identified at Period 11, the demand mean has stabilized around 171 units with a very high standard deviation (approx 120-130). Given the critical ratio q=0.8 (4/(4+1)), the priority is to maintain sufficient safety stock to capture these profitable spikes while accepting the holding costs. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=28 to capture the entire volatile regime since Period 11, which provides a more robust statistical foundation for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 than the full history or a very short-term window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently high-mean and high-volatility, with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units (e.g., P31: 509, P34: 357, P38: 326). This shift represents a distinct regime compared to the first 10 periods. For Period 40, I am using a recent_N window of 29 periods to capture the entirety of this high-volatility regime (starting from Period 11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased service level needs while acknowledging the extreme variance. The lead time L is consistently 0, so I will continue with the default setting. The on-hand inventory is currently 84 units with no units in transit, so a standard base-stock calculation for (L+1) periods will trigger an appropriate order to cover immediate potential demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P11 to P39: Mean demand is ~188 with very high volatility (StdDev ~125). Multiple extreme demand events (>300 units) have occurred, consistently necessitating a high safety stock approach to avoid stockouts during spike periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 11 and has remained in a high-mean, high-volatility state through Period 40. From Period 11 to 40 (30 periods), the mean demand is approximately 188.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 124.9. The current on-hand inventory is 157 units, with 0 in-transit since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in the Period 40 conclude message). To maximize reward (Profit=$4, Holding=$1) while mitigating frequent stockouts caused by demand spikes (e.g., P31: 509, P34: 357, P38: 326), I will use the established regime length (N=30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a larger N (30) captures the full variability of this high-risk period, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover these extreme spikes while current lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1144.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 consistently demonstrates a higher mean (approx. 188) and extreme volatility (StdDev approx. 125), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units. Period 41 experienced such a spike (296 units), leading to a stockout. Based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level q is 0.8. Given the high volatility and recent stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 300 to aggressively rebuild inventory and cushion against the high-frequency spikes observed in the current regime (P11-P41). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=31 (the length of the current regime starting at P11) to capture the high variance inherent in this period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

The demand regime since Period 11 continues to exhibit high mean (approx. 188) and extreme volatility (StdDev approx. 125), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units. Period 41 saw a demand of 296, leading to a stockout, followed by Period 42 with 213. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the sustained high demand and frequent spikes while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=32 (covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 11 to 42). This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant statistics from the current regime to set a base stock that provides adequate safety stock against the observed volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 remains highly volatile with a current mean of approximately 189 units and a standard deviation of roughly 125 units (based on recent_N=33). We are in Period 44 of 50. Inventory on-hand is 272 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the frequent extreme demand spikes (e.g., Period 31: 509, Period 41: 296, Period 42: 213) and avoid stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=33 to capture the entire high-volatility regime starting from Period 11. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the high variance while balancing the holding cost against the profit margin of $4.0 vs $1.0.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently high and extremely volatile, with a mean around 180-190 units and frequent spikes exceeding 300 units (e.g., P31: 509, P34: 357, P38: 326). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. For the final periods of the simulation, protecting against stockouts is prioritized due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), which justifies a high service level. I will use the last 34 periods (from P11 to P44) to capture the current high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR engine's base-stock calculation accounts for the increased mean (approximately 188) and the high standard deviation observed in this period range.

The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently high and extremely volatile, with a mean around 180-190 and a standard deviation exceeding 120. Period 45 saw another high demand event (292 units) that depleted available stock. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical fractile is 0.8, justifying high safety stock to capture these frequent spikes. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 46, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=35 to encompass the entire high-volatility regime starting at Period 11. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the elevated mean and the significant variance required to maintain service levels amidst unpredictable spikes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently volatile with a mean around 180-190 units and frequent large spikes. Recently, we see spikes in P41 (296), P42 (213), and P45 (292), interspersed with low demand periods like P43 (17) and P46 (22). Lead time remains 0. Current on-hand inventory is 264 units. Given the high criticality of stockouts in this high-volatility environment (Profit is 4x Holding Cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the statistics of the current volatile regime (P27-P46). This N captures the most recent behavior while providing enough stability to estimate the high standard deviation required for a sufficient safety stock. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the possibility of another 300+ unit spike immediately.

Currently, we have 309 units on hand, which is significantly above the mean but necessary given the potential for extreme spikes (e.g., P31 demand was 509). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Since we are near the end of the simulation (3 periods left), the primary goal is to satisfy remaining demand while avoiding excessive ending inventory that incurs holding costs. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=37 (covering the regime start at P11 to P47) to capture the current high-volatility mean and variance. This high safety stock approach is justified by the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) and the history of stockouts during spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1181.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The demand regime from Period 11 to present is characterized by a mean of approximately 188 units and extremely high volatility (StdDev ~125), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units (the most recent being 298 units in Period 48). Despite the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout, the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) suggests maintaining a robust safety stock, especially since stockouts have been frequent. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To capture the high-variance behavior of the current regime while acknowledging the recent spike, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to cover the most relevant high-volatility history. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the potential of another large demand event in these final two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-311.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime established around Period 11. Mean demand from Period 11 to 49 is approximately 180 units with a high standard deviation (approx 125). In the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49), demand has remained volatile with several high spikes (296, 213, 292, 298) alternating with periods of zero or very low demand (0, 17, 0). The on-hand inventory is currently 311 units with no units in transit. Since the promised and actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the potential for high-end spikes. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is the baseline, but the backend's capped policy requires robust mu_hat and sigma_hat values to prevent stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-volatility regime while reflecting the slightly higher mean observed in the later half of the game compared to the very early periods.
