{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward over the 50 periods. We are currently at Period 49, with only two periods of demand remaining (Period 49 and 50). The lead time is confirmed as 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in the same period to satisfy that period's demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Historical data from the 'post-P16' demand regime shows an average demand of approximately 178 units with extreme volatility (peaks > 300, lows near 0). Given that leftover inventory in Period 50 incurs a holding cost of $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit per unit sold, and this is the second-to-last period, we must order enough to cover P49 demand without creating excessive residue for P50. The OR recommendation of 251 units is based on the full history. Looking at the recent regime (P16-P48), the average including zeros is higher, but there is significant variance. Since the game ends after Period 50, any inventory held at the end of P49 is available for P50. I will order 280 units to provide a high service level for P49 while likely leaving enough to cover a significant portion of P50 demand, reducing the need for a large, risky order in the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time analysis: Historical data from Periods 1-49 consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory analysis: We currently have 280 units on-hand with 0 units in-transit. Demand analysis: The demand regime shifted around Period 16, with the post-P16 average being approximately 178 units and significant volatility (standard deviation > 100, peaks > 500). Recent demand has been extremely erratic, showing 298 units in P48 and 0 units in P49. Strategy: Since the lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because current inventory (280) exceeds its calculated base-stock level. However, given the high volatility and potential for spikes exceeding 300 units (as seen in P31, P34, P38), 280 units might be slightly lean if another peak occurs this period. Nonetheless, the holding cost is $1.00 relative to $4.00 profit, suggesting we shouldn't overstock. Moving from 280 to a target closer to 350 (a common high-water mark in the history) would require ordering 70 units. However, following the OR recommendation of 0 is safe for this single period because 280 is well above the average demand and covers ~80% of historical demand outcomes.",
