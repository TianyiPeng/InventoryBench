The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed this period should arrive and be available to satisfy this period's demand (Resolution Step 2). Historical samples for 'chips(Regular)' show demand of 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127. The average demand across these samples is 92.4 units per period. Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I must place an order immediately. Given the high variance (0 to 170), I will aim for a target inventory that covers the upper end of the demand range to avoid stockouts, especially since the holding cost is relatively low ($1) compared to the profit ($4). I will order 130 units as a baseline for the first period, balancing the average and the recent high observations.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a high-volatility/bimodal demand regime. Recent demand spikes reach up to ~300-500 units (e.g., P41: 296, P45: 292, P48: 298), while intervening periods can drop to zero (P47: 0, P49: 0). The 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 154 units, but the high-end spikes are the primary driver for stockout risk. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 350 units. Since this is the final period (Period 50), the objective is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. Historical data shows that demand rarely exceeds 350 except in extreme outliers (P20: 420, P31: 509, P34: 357). Given the current on-hand inventory of 350 units and the bimodal nature where recent spikes have hovered around 300, 350 units is a sufficient buffer to cover Period 50 demand without ordering more and incurring additional holding costs on unsold units.",
