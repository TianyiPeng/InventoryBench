Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a high-volatility regime with a standard lead time of 0 periods, confirmed throughout the game. Recent demand patterns show extreme fluctuations (e.g., Period 49 demand was 0, while Period 48 was 298). Historical data indicates a demand ceiling around 510-550 units. Operating at an inventory target of 550 units has successfully mitigated stockouts for many periods while keeping holding costs manageable ($1 per unit). This is the final period (Period 50). Since demand resolution occurs after the decision phase, any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs without the possibility of future sales. Given that current on-hand inventory is 550 units, there is already sufficient stock to cover even the historical maximum demand event (509 units). Ordering additional units would only increase the ending inventory and total holding costs without providing any additional reward potential. Therefore, the optimal action for the final period is to order 0 units.",
