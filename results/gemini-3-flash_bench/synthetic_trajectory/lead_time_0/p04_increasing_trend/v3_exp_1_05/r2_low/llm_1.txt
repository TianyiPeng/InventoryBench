The average demand over five periods is approximately 110 units. Lead time analysis: Every period (P1 through P5) shows the order arrived in the same period it was placed (lead_time = 0).

Current inventory assessment: On-hand = 80 units; In-transit = 0. To prepare for P6, I need enough inventory to cover P6 demand (~110-140 range).

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend. Recent demand observations for P44-P47 are 873, 907, 968, and 957 units, respectively. The average of the last three periods (P45-P47) is approximately 944 units, confirming a shift into the 950-1000 range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With only 63 units on hand and 0 in-transit from previous periods, and considering the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet this elevated demand levels while being mindful of holding costs for the final periods. Given the trend, I forecast demand for Period 48 to be around 1000 units. To satisfy this and maintain a small buffer against further spikes, I will order enough to bring available inventory to approximately 1050 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand growth sustained: Average demand for P45-P47 is ~944 units, with a peak of 968 in P46. The SKU has moved into a 950-1000 units/period regime, continuing its long-term expansion. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend. Demand for Period 48 reached 1,043, which is a new peak. Looking at the most recent regime, the average demand for P46-P48 is ~989 units, representing a clear move into a 1,000+ units/period regime. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive and be available for the current period's demand. Given the persistent growth and the history of stockouts when under-ordering, I will project Period 49 demand to be approximately 1,070-1,100 units to account for continued momentum. With 7 units on-hand, I will order 1,093 units to target a total available inventory of 1,100 units.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, which has been consistent since Period 9. The most recent demand (P49) reached 1,097 units, following 1,043 in P48 and 957 in P47. The average demand for the last three periods is approximately 1,032 units, moving the SKU into a 1,000-1,100+ range. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Given the high growth rate and the fact that holding costs and stockout losses (lost profit) are equal ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to order slightly above the most recent demand to accommodate continued growth while minimizing excessive holding costs. With 3 units currently on-hand and an expected demand target of ~1,150 to account for growth, I will order 1,147 units.",
