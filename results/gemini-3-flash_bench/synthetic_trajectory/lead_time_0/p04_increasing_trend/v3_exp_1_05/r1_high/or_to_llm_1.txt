Final Strategy: To reach an ending inventory that buffers against continued high demand, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand of ~200 plus a safety buffer, minus on-hand stock.

The most recent demands are 845, 919, and 930. The OR recommendation of 680 units is significantly lagging behind this trajectory because it uses all historical data (including early periods where demand was around 100) and hasn't adapted to the current regime which is clearly above 900. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time remains 0. Currently, 70 units are on hand. To meet expected demand (which is likely to be between 930 and 1000 given the current momentum), I will ignore the OR recommendation and order 950 units.

The OR baseline recommendation of 796 units is severely lagging because it relies on long-term historical averages and does not account for this extreme recent growth. With an actual lead time of 0 periods, the objective is to order enough to satisfy the demand for Period 49. Given the upward trajectory (+50 units per period recently), I forecast Period 49 demand to be approximately 1070-1100 units. To minimize the risk of another stockout (which occurred in P44 and P45), I will target an order that brings total availability (on-hand + order) to 1100 units.

Analyzing the last 5 periods: P45 (919), P46 (930), P47 (986), P48 (1036), and P49 (1104, which resulted in a stockout of 4 units). The mean demand over these 5 periods is approximately 995 units, with a clear positive trend. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time for this period's demand. The OR recommendation of 858 units is severely lagging behind the current demand reality, as it likely weights early low-demand periods too heavily. Given the recurring stockouts (P44, P45, P49) and a demand level that has increased for nearly 50 consecutive periods, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for P50 plus a small safety buffer. Following the trend from P48 (1036) to P49 (1104), demand is increasing by ~70 units per period. Projecting P50 at approximately 1170-1200 units is appropriate to avoid yet another stockout, especially since the holding cost ($1) is very low compared to the profit margin ($19).",
