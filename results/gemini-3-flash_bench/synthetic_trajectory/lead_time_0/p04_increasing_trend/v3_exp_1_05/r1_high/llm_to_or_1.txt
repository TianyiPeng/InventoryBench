Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive within the same period. Historical demand for the last five periods shows values of 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a noticeable upward trend in demand over the last three periods (107 -> 127 -> 160). Given this trend, using the global mean (approx 115) might lead to stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~131) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the recent volatility. Lead time 'L' will be set to 'default' (0) as we have no evidence yet of deviations from the promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 176 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The ending inventory is 58 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. However, the game history shows Period 1 demand was actually 118, which is slightly higher than the initial sample of 103 provided. Demand appears to be trending upwards (samples: 81 -> 107 -> 127 -> 160). Given that L=0, the base stock formula (mu + z*sigma) needs to cover 1 period of demand (L+1=1). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend in demand more effectively than the long-term average, while L remains at the default promised value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1593.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same periods). Demand for the first two periods was 118 and 88, following the historical samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The current on-hand inventory is 79. Since there is no lead time (L=0), the OR backend needs parameters to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend seen in the historical data (last 5 samples are 103, 81, 107, 127, 160, mean=115.6) while ignoring the slightly lower realized demand in P1-P2. This will ensure we maintain enough stock for the upward trend suggested by the later historical samples (P4=127, P5=160).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1996.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have an on-hand inventory of 56 units. Moving into Period 5, we observe that the lead time for this SKU has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Historical demand for the first three periods was 118, 88, and 108. The user-provided historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show a rising trend starting from Period 4. Specifically, demand increased to 127 in Period 4 and is forecasted to hit 160 in Period 5. To account for this upward shift, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand observation (127) and the next expected value (160). Given L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean_demand. I will set mu_hat to 145 (average of 127 and 160) to proactively cover the surge. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the increased volatility seen in the transition from a stable ~100 range to the 120-160 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1313.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in Periods 1-4 has consistently been 0. Historical demand samples are [118, 88, 108, 75], with a mean of 97.25 and a standard deviation of approximately 18.91. Demand has fluctuated but does not show a definitive trend or regime shift yet. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current volatility and mean, as this includes all available data points and reflects the current environment. The base stock level will be calculated by the OR backend using these parameters to balance the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1770.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [118, 88, 108, 75, 95], resulting in a historical mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments to date (Periods 1-5) have arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the on-hand inventory is currently low (35 units) relative to the average demand, and there is no inventory in-transit, we need to restock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2315.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Historical lead time calculation from Periods 1-6 consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, and 122. The mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of about 18. Given the stability of the demand and the 0-period lead time, I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period of coverage) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which justifies a higher service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand spiked to 167 units, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 131. The historical demand samples (P1-P5) and actual game results (P1-P7) show an upward trend or a high-variance environment (P7 demand was significantly higher than the previous average of ~100). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history (P1-P7 all arrived same-period). To recover from the stockout and prepare for potentially higher demand, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the recent upward shift in demand and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) will focus on the demand increase seen in Periods 3-7 (avg ~114) versus the full history. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility or regime shift observed: Period 7 demand (167) significantly exceeded the previous 6-period average (~101), leading to a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3249.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)'. In Period 7 (167 units) and Period 8 (214 units), demand significantly exceeded the previous average (~101). Both periods resulted in stockouts because the supply was restricted by the inventory logic. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover service levels and capture this upward trend, I am focusing on the most recent 3 periods (Periods 6-8) where demand shifted from 122 to 214. This increases mu_hat to reflect the higher expected volume and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed: Avg demand rose from ~100 to ~168 over Periods 6-8 (+68%). Period 8 demand reached a new high of 214.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3736.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' that began around Period 7. The demand for the last three periods (P7-P9) has been 167, 214, and 199, averaging approximately 193.3 units per period. This is a significant increase from the initial average of ~100. Despite a slight dip from 214 to 199 in Period 9, the levels remain much higher than the historical baseline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to utilize. To account for this sustained growth and high volatility (ranging from 167 to 214), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4, Periods 6-9) to capture the trend and the higher variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to prevent the stockouts observed in P7 and P8, while maintaining the high service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from Period 7-9 is ~193, compared to the initial ~100 baseline. Volatility remains elevated with a range of 167 to 214.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Periods 1-6, the average demand was ~101. Starting at Period 7, demand spiked to 167, 214, 199, and most recently 125 in Period 10. While Period 10 shows a dip, the average of this high-demand regime (Periods 7-10) is ~176.3. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm this shift. We are currently in Period 11 with 118 units on hand and 0 in transit. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 7 and 8, I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) to capture this new elevated regime while slightly smoothing the recent volatility. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised, based on the history of same-period arrivals (P1-P10). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to prioritize the high-demand observations over the earlier low-demand baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3538.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial baseline (Periods 1-6) averaged ~101 units per period. Starting at Period 7, demand increased sharply, averaging ~179 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11: 167, 214, 199, 125, 189). Although Period 10 showed a dip to 125, the overall trend remains much higher than the initial phase. History confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (orders arrive the same period), which maintains a requirement for (L+1)=1 period of coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent average (~179) and the increased volatility observed in this new phase. This prevents under-ordering while accounting for the recent stockouts in Periods 7 and 8.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Periods 1-6, the average demand was approximately 101. Starting Period 7, demand increased significantly with values of 167, 214, 199, 125, 189, and 213. The average demand for this latter period (P7-P12) is 184.5. This high-demand regime is sustained and shows higher volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and variance. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to assume. The goal is to set the base stock high enough to satisfy this elevated demand while accounting for the high volatility seen recently.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed for Periods 7-12: average demand increased from ~100 to ~185 (+85%), with increased volatility (sigma).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime since Period 7. Over the last 7 periods (P7-P13), demand has averaged approximately 189 units (167, 214, 199, 125, 189, 213, 215), compared to the initial baseline of ~100. Recent demand is particularly strong, with the last two periods exceeding 210 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable, as evidenced by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the period since the regime shift began, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current market conditions rather than the lower-demand history of Periods 1-6.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 7. The initial average demand (Periods 1-6) was approximately 101 units, but the average demand since then (Periods 7-14) has jumped to approximately 190.5 units, representing a sustained increase of ~88%. Recent demand values (214, 199, 125, 189, 213, 215, 202) confirm this high-demand, high-volatility environment. To reflect this current regime and ensure a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile), I am using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire high-demand period while excluding the lower-demand start. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method to maintain that 0-period expectation.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 7. Demand in Periods 7-15 has averaged 186.9 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P12-P15) show a sustained high level (213, 215, 202, 158), with an average of 197 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as evidenced by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this history. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime (P7-P15), which provides a stable mean for this new level. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the higher volatility observed during this period compared to the start of the game.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 7. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is approximately 187.7 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 27.6. This is a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~100 units observed in P1-P6. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for a reactive ordering strategy. To optimize the service level and maximize profit (given a high critical ratio/profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods of data (N=10) to capture this established regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0) as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 7. Over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), the average demand is approximately 188 units, a significant shift from the initial 100-unit baseline. The most recent demand observations (P16 and P17) were both 195 units, suggesting continued stability in this higher range. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given this sustained regime, I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while excluding the lower-demand early periods. A high base stock is maintained because the critical ratio is high ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), making the cost of a stockout much higher than the cost of holding inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4465.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand spiked to 250, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 235. The current demand regime (Periods 12-18) shows a mean of approximately 204 units (213, 215, 202, 158, 195, 195, 250) with significant volatility. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N to capture this higher demand regime, setting N=7. This ensures the OR backend calculates mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent behavior, where demand is higher and more volatile than the initial stages of the game. Our inventory is currently 0, so the system needs to order enough to cover the expected high demand for Period 19 immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: single-period peak demand reached 250, pushing the 7-period average to ~204 (+10% from the previous ~185 average).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular) which has transitioned through multiple demand regimes. The initial baseline (Periods 1-6) was ~101 units/period. A major shift occurred starting at Period 7, increasing to ~185 units/period. Recently (Periods 18-19), demand peaked at 250 and 215, suggesting a further increase or sustained high-variance performance around an average of ~200. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order until Period 19 concluding within the same period. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical path is avoiding stockouts during this high-demand phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire 'high demand' regime (Periods 7-19) while filtering out the low-demand start of the game. For lead time, 'calculate' is appropriate as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 7-19) average demand is ~195 units/period, with peak volatility reaching 250 units in Period 18. Stockout risk is high; prioritization of service level is necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4693.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 showed a significant demand surge to 324 units, which is a new peak (previous was 250 in Period 18). This confirms a second demand regime shift or extreme acceleration within the high-demand period that started around Period 7. The current 14-period average (P7-P20) is approximately 205, but the last 3 periods average 263. Given the stockout in Period 20 (selling only 247 of 324 demanded) and zero on-hand inventory, I am shifting to an 'explicit' forecast to proactively capture this higher mean and volatility. I will use a mu_hat based on the elevated recent average (~260) and a high explicit sigma_hat (~60) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to avoid further stockouts during this spike. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime secondary shift at Period 20: Demand surged to 324, increasing the 3-period average to 263 (+35% vs previous high-regime average of 195). High stockout risk persists.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that accelerated significantly around Period 20. The demand in the last three periods has been 215 (P19), 324 (P20), and 283 (P21), resulting in a three-period average of approximately 274 units. This is a substantial increase over the previous high-regime average of ~195 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To prevent stockouts during this surge, I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This captures the most recent demand spike while allowing the OR backend to apply a high service level logic (q = 19/20 = 0.95) to manage volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime secondary shift confirmed at Period 20: 3-period average demand (P19-P21) is 274 units, a 40% increase over the previous Period 7-19 average (~195).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6075.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a secondary high-demand regime starting at Period 20. The last three periods (P20-P22) have seen demands of 324, 283, and 322 respectively, with an average of approximately 310 units per period. This is a significant increase (over 50%) from the previous high-regime average of ~195 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To account for this step-change in demand and high stockout risk (evidenced by the zero inventory after Period 20 despite high orders), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to specifically capture this latest shifted regime. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that reflects the current 310+ unit demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 20: 3-period average demand (P20-P22) is ~310 units, a 59% increase over the previous regime (P7-P19 average of ~195).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6232.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a second major shift. While the first regime (P7-P19) averaged ~195 units/period, the current regime starting at Period 20 has shown four consecutive periods of significantly higher demand: P20 (324), P21 (283), P22 (322), and P23 (329). The average for these last 4 periods is 314.5 units, which is a 61% increase over the previous high regime. Observed lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this highly profitable ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) but high-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the new baseline and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current pace of consumption.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 20: 4-period average demand (P20-P23) is ~315 units, maintaining a ~61% increase over the P7-P19 average (~195).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 and have observed a sustained high-demand regime since Period 20. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 308.8 units (324, 283, 322, 329, 286), which is a significant increase from the previous regime (P7-P19) average of ~195. All orders to date have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is stable. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth/high-demand phase and maximize profit (19:1 ratio to holding cost), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift (P20-P24) confirmed: average demand is ~309 units, a ~58% increase over the P7-P19 average of ~195.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6154.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime that began at Period 20. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), the demand values have been 324, 283, 322, 329, 286, and 325, yielding an average of approximately 311.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (21 units), meaning we are heavily reliant on the current period's order arriving as expected to meet demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). To maintain high service levels and capture the profit margin ($19) while accounting for the recent regime shift, I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior and ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher mean and the observed volatility in this secondary regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting at Period 20. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P20-P26), the average demand is 317.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The most recent demand (P26) reached 351, which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the current base stock calculation needs to be more aggressive to accommodate this high-demand ceiling. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current mean and volatility better than the full history or the previous lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime (P20-P26) confirmed: average demand is ~317 units, maintaining a ~63% increase over the P7-P19 average of ~195.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6802.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a secondary high-demand regime starting around Period 20. Over the last 8 periods (P20-P27), the average demand has risen further to approximately 325 units per period, with a recent peak of 379 in Period 27 resulting in a stockout. The product is highly profitable ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), necessitating a high service level. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive to meet this period's demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this latest sustained shift and ensure the base stock level is sufficient to cover current demand peaks and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 20: 8-period average (P20-P27) has reached ~325 units, significantly higher than the P7-P19 average of ~195 units. Recent demand peak of 379 units (P27) indicates increasing volatility within this high-demand phase.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a secondary high-growth phase starting around Period 20. Recent demand figures (P26: 351, P27: 379, P28: 394) show a clear upward trend and increased volatility, significantly exceeding the previous high-demand regime average of ~195. The service level must remain high to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in P26-P28. I am using recent_N=9 to capture this specific regime (P20-P28), which yields an average demand of approximately 332 units per period with a notable standard deviation. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the concluding messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again starting Period 26: 3-period average (P26-P28) reached ~375 units, a 15% increase over the P20-P25 average (~325), signaling potentially another regime shift or peak seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7486.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-growth phase. Since Period 26, demand has consistently increased (351, 379, 394, 402), confirming the insight from Period 29 that volatility and mean demand are rising. Specifically, the 4-period average from P26-P29 is 381.5, significantly higher than the P20-P25 average of ~309. The stockout in Period 29 (sold 394 vs 402 demand) highlights the need to aggressively adjust parameters to keep pace with this trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To address the upward trend, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current 380+ units/period level, and N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the wider high-demand regime since Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand trend (P26-P29): Average demand elevated to ~382 units, a 23% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309), resulting in repeated stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P26-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant upward trend, with the most recent observed demand in Period 30 reaching 457 units. This represents another clear regime shift starting around Period 26. The 5-period average (P26-P30) is 396.6 units, compared to the previously recorded average of ~317. We have experienced five consecutive stockouts (P26-P30), indicating our stock levels are trailing significantly behind demand growth. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock calculation simplifies, but because demand is accelerating at each step, using a larger N would underestimate the current needs. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand profile (avg ~397, std ~41) while accounting for the recent acceleration to avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand shift confirmed (P26-P30): 5-period average demand is ~397 units, a 25% increase over the P20-P25 average (~317). Five consecutive stockouts observed as demand increased from 351 to 457 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7579.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a very high level beginning around Period 26. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is approximately 398 units (351, 379, 394, 402, 457, 402), with a significant peak of 457. This is a substantial increase from the P20-P25 average of ~309. The persistent stockouts from P26-P30 (ending inventory of 0) indicate that previous order levels were insufficient to meet this surge. Period 31 finally saw a small residual inventory (59 units) after ordering 461 units, suggesting the order volume is finally catching up to the current demand level. Lead time consistency is observed at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture the profit margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I am using method 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this current high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This will set the base stock level to cover the projected 400+ unit demand plus a safety buffer for the high variance seen in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8645.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts. The most recent shift started around Period 26, with demand increasing from ~310 to ~415 units. In Period 32, demand reached a new high of 507, resulting in another stockout (ending inventory 0). We are currently in a high-demand, high-volatility phase. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is approximately 432 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high critical ratio (Profit $19 vs Holding Cost $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P28-P32) to capture the heart of this latest surge. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all concluded periods. Using the last 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level and the increased variance observed in the recent peak (507).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge continued at Period 32: single-period peak demand reached 507 units. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is now ~432 units, reflecting a ~35% increase over the previous high-demand regime (P20-P25 average ~317). Stockouts occurred in 6 of the last 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9747.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant upward surge. Recent periods show a clear shift: Period 31 (402), Period 32 (507), and Period 33 (518). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 457.2, but the last 3 periods average 475.7, and the most recent 2 periods average 512.5. Stockouts have occurred in 7 of the last 8 periods, indicating that current base stock levels are consistently lagging behind the rapidly increasing demand. Observed lead time remains 0 periods (same-period arrival). To capture this accelerating trend and prevent further stockouts, I am using a recent window of N=5 to calculate the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), which provides a mean of ~457. Given the profit margin ($19.0) vs holding cost ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level is 95%, which is appropriate for this high-growth phase to satisfy customer demand and maximize reward.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: 5-period average (P29-P33) increased to ~457 units (+48% vs P20-P25 average of ~309). Single-period demand peaked at 518 in Period 33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with a high-demand regime established since Period 26. The 5-period average demand (P30-P34) is approximately 475 units, significantly higher than the previous regime (P20-P25) of 309 units. In the last 9 periods, there have been 7 stockouts, indicating our base stock level is persistently trailing the actual demand curve. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1, justifying a high service level. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To catch up with the current demand trend and mitigate stockout risk, I am selecting a recent window of N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This focuses the OR engine on the most recent, highest demand samples (averaging 475 with a peak of 518) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently elevated to meet the current consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P30-P34) confirmed: 5-period average demand is ~475 units, a 54% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309). Continued stockout risk present.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a sustained high-demand regime. Period 35 recorded the highest demand yet at 591 units, resulting in another stockout. The most recent 5-period average (P31-P35) has reached ~502 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~432 recorded in Period 33. Given the extremely high critical ratio (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), the backend OR policy will naturally aim for a high service level. However, to prevent chronic stockouts in this rapidly growing trend, I must adjust the forecast to reflect the most recent regime shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this latest surge (avg ~502), and I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed in recent periods (range 402 to 591). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed (P31-P35): 5-period average demand has reached ~502 units, a 58% increase over the P20-P25 average (~317) and a 16% increase over the P28-P32 average (~432). Peak demand reached 591 units in Period 35, continuing a pattern of stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10354.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant upward trend, with the most recent high-demand regime starting around Period 31. The 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 531 units (507, 518, 492, 591, 549), which is a clear increase over the previously identified regime average of ~475 units. Period 35 saw a peak demand of 591 units, and while Period 36 was slightly lower at 549, the stockout risk remains extremely high as evidenced by ending inventories frequently hitting zero. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and provide a sufficient buffer against the high volatility (sigma), I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N covers the most recent sharp climb and the current stabilization at this higher level, ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR backend (z* ~ 1.88 for a 95% service level) account for the latest demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P31-P36) confirmed: 6-period average demand is ~518 units, a 9% increase over the P30-P34 average (~475) and a 68% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309). Peak demand in this regime reached 591 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10905.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 37 demand was 576 units, confirming the high-demand regime identified earlier. Analyzing the most recent data (P31-P37), the 7-period average demand has risen to approximately 526 units, with a peak of 591 units in Period 35. The inventory level is currently very low (39 units on-hand), and since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by every single 'conclude' message in the history), I must ensure the order placed this period, plus remaining on-hand stock, can cover this new, higher demand level. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (mu_hat) with N=7 to capture this most recent sustained regime (P31-P37), which better reflects the current status than the long-term history. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the increased volatility of this phase, ensuring a high service level to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the previous 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P31-P37) confirmed: 7-period average demand is ~526 units, representing a 70% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309) and a 1.5% increase over the P31-P36 average (~518).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from an average of ~382 (Periods 26-29) to ~526 (Periods 31-38). The most recent demand at Period 38 was 614, which is the highest observed value and significantly above the 7-period average of 526. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth phase, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most current demand trajectory (Periods 34-38 average: ~564). This N value allows the model to react to the recent acceleration while maintaining some stability. I am setting sigma_hat using the same recent window to account for the increased volatility seen in recent peaks (reaching 614). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived' messages in the concluding history.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak observed at Period 38 (614 units). The demand regime from Period 31-38 now averages ~537 units, representing a 74% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309).

Daily Reward (R_t): $12198.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a state of continuous acceleration. Period 39 demand reached 648 units, which is a new peak and resulted in an ending inventory of 0 despite ordering 632 units. The 5-period average (P35-P39) has climbed to ~596 units, confirming the 'at least 15% increase' pattern observed in previous transitions. From Period 31 to 39, the trend is clearly upward (402, 507, 518, 492, 591, 549, 576, 614, 648). To address the chronic stockouts (P32, P33, P35, P39 were all 0 ending inventory), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this latest surge. Since lead time (L) remains consistently 0, the backend will target a base stock roughly equal to this 5-period average plus safety stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally set a high service level (z-score), which is necessary here to stop the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P35-P39) confirmed: 5-period average demand is ~596 units, a 15% increase over the P31-P35 average (~518) and a 93% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309). Peak demand in this regime reached 648 units in P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12322.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a clear, sustained upward trend, with the most recent 5-period average (P36-P40) reaching 607.2 units, a significant increase from the previous high-demand regimes. The peak demand reached 649 units in Period 40. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is critical. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P39, and only 9 in P40) indicate the current ordering strategy is just barely meeting or trailing the actual demand. I am setting the lead time L to 'default' (promised 0) as arrivals have consistently been same-day. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~607), and for sigma_hat, N=5 will capture the current volatility (std dev approx 42). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and the significant variance observed in this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P36-P40) confirmed: 5-period average demand is ~607 units, a 17% increase over the P31-P35 average (~518) and a 96% increase over the P20-P25 average (~309). This represents a sustained peak demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12920.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another significant growth phase. In Period 41, demand reached a new peak of 755 units, far exceeding the previous 5-period average of ~607 units. This represents a 24% single-period jump and resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand regime has consistently trended upward throughout the history, moving from ~100 to ~200, then ~300, ~500, and now appearing to move toward a ~700+ level. To capture this rapid acceleration and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to prioritize the most recent surge (averaging ~684 units). Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three periods (648, 649, 755). Lead time remains 0 as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 41: Demand surged to 755 units, a 24% increase over the P36-P40 average (~607). This marks the start of a potential 700+ unit demand phase.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new significantly higher regime. Period 41 saw demand jump to 755 and Period 42 followed with 741. This validates the '700+ unit phase' suspicion noted in the previous carry-over insight. The 2-period average for P41-P42 is ~748, which is about 24% higher than the P36-P40 average of ~607. To prevent stockouts in this rapidly accelerating environment, I am shifting the focus to the most recent demand behavior. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the start of this 700+ surge (P40=649, P41=755, P42=741). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals (confirmed up to Period 42). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 ensures the base stock calculation responds quickly to the latest peak while maintaining a buffer for the observed high volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P41-P42) confirmed: Avg demand jumped to ~748 units, a 23% increase over the P36-P40 average (~607). Demand has consistently exceeded 740 units for two consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14670.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a sustained high-demand regime. Specifically, the last three periods (P41-P43) have shown demands of 755, 741, and 774, averaging ~757 units. This follows the previously identified regime shift at P41. In P43, we ended with 36 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the service level requirement is very high (q = 0.95), justifying a robust base stock to avoid stockouts during this growth phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current 750+ unit demand level and its associated volatility, while keeping L at the default (promised 0) as it is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P41-P43) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~757 units, representing a 25% increase over the P36-P40 average (~607).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14896.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trend, with Period 44 demand reaching a new peak of 845 units, causing yet another stockout (units sold capped at 784). The demand regime that began around Period 41 has seen averages climb from ~750 to a current 4-period average (P41-P44) of approximately 779 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the priority remains maximizing service levels to capture this surging demand while minimizing missed sales. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt quickly to the recent surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the ~779 unit average, and sigma_hat using the same period to reflect current volatility. This 'recent_N' approach ensures that the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current 750-850 unit demand window rather than being anchored by lower historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further starting Period 41: 4-period average (P41-P44) reached ~779 units, a 30% increase over the P36-P40 average (~607). Demand reached a new peak of 845 units in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another aggressive growth phase starting at Period 41. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Recent demand history shows a significant jump: Period 44 reached 845 units and Period 45 hit a new peak of 919 units. The 5-period average (P41-P45) is approximately 807 units, which is a 33% increase over the previous regime (P36-P40 average of ~607). We have observed stockouts in 2 of the last 3 periods despite increasing order sizes, indicating that historical averages are lagging behind the rapid trend. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given high profit/holding cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this latest surge while maintaining responsiveness. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility accompanying this demand spike.

Carry-over insight: New demand acceleration confirmed at Period 41: 5-period average (P41-P45) is ~807 units, a 33% increase over the P36-P40 average (~607). Demand reached a new all-time peak of 919 units in Period 45, resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17670.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. Following the regime shift identified at Period 41, demand has scaled from ~750 units to a new peak of 930 units in Period 46. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is currently ~842 units, a 39% increase over the previous stable regime (P36-P40 avg ~607). We have observed consecutive stockouts or near-stockouts (Ending inventory 0 in P44, P45, P46), indicating the inventory levels are trailing the actual demand curve. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this aggressive upward trend and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the P42-P46 acceleration) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance associated with this growth phase. The service level remains high due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (~95% critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained (P42-P46): 5-period average increased to ~842 units (+39% vs P36-P40 average of ~607). New demand peak of 930 units reached in Period 46, resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18639.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 47 recording 986 units, marking the 4th consecutive period of record-high demand and the 3rd consecutive stockout. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is ~891 units, a significant increase from the ~807 units observed just two periods ago. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To counter the persistent stockouts and capture the current growth trend, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to focus on the immediate demand surge, and sigma_hat using recent_N 5 to reflect the high volatility (sigma \u2248 85 units over the last 5 periods). This strategy aims to elevate the base stock level sufficiently to meet demand that is now approaching 1,000 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained (P43-P47): 5-period average increased to ~891 units (+47% vs P36-P40 average of ~607). New demand peak of 986 units reached in Period 47, resulting in continued stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19513.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a phase of hyper-growth, with the most recent sample (P48) reaching a new peak of 1036. The 5-period average (P44-P48) is approximately 943 units, which is a significant increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%). However, because demand is accelerating faster than a global or long-term average can capture, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent, highest-demand data points. This will help minimize the frequent stockouts observed in the last 5 periods where demand repeatedly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-acceleration sustained (P44-P48): 5-period average demand increased to ~943 units (+56% vs P36-P40 average of ~607). New demand peak of 1036 reached in Period 48, continuing the stockout trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20178.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a hyper-acceleration phase, characterized by consecutive all-time highs and stockouts. Period 49 demand reached 1,104, reflecting a 17% increase over the 5-period average (P44-P48) of ~943 units. The system is entering Period 50 with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held, the primary objective is to set a base stock that covers this extremely steep upward trajectory to capture significant profit ($19/unit) while minimizing lost sales. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 (Periods 47-49) to capture the most immediate acceleration (avg ~1042) which will then be extrapolated by the OR backend. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increasing volatility accompanying this demand surge. This aggressive posture is necessary as ending inventory has been 0 for the last five periods, suggesting the backend 'cap' and previous estimates are being consistently outpaced by actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-acceleration sustained (P45-P49): 5-period average demand increased to ~995 units (+64% vs P36-P40 average of ~607). New demand peak of 1104 reached in Period 49, continuing the stockout trend.
