As this is the first decision in a 50-period run, I need to establish inventory immediately. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. To avoid stockouts while accounting for the upward trend seen in the historical samples (P4: 127, P5: 160), I will target an order slightly above the historical average to provide a buffer for same-period demand.
