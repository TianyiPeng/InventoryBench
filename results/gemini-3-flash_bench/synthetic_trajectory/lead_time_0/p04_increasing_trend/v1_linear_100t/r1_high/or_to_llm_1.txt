The OR recommendation of 3,950 units is based on all historical data and fails to capture this recent acceleration, effectively falling below the recent 5-period average. Since the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (arrivals occur in the same period as ordered), the goal is to cover the expected demand for the current period while accounting for the small on-hand inventory of 266 units. Given that Period 42 saw demand as high as 4,421, I will target a stock level of approximately 4,500 units. Total needed = 4,500 - 266 (on-hand) = 4,234. I will round this to 4,250 to ensure adequate coverage of the 4,200+ regime.",
