Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial setup. Promised lead time is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend over the first five periods (107 to 544). Since there is no prior history or concluding messages yet, I will use the 'default' methods which will utilize the available historical samples. The upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) suggests a rapidly growing regime, but since this is the first decision point and I only have these 5 initial samples provided as context, the 'default' stats (mean approx 315) provide a reasonable baseline while the OR engine's service level logic (high profit/holding ratio) will naturally buffer for the high variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 134, which aligns closely with the provided sample for Period 1 (107). The lead time for the first order was 0, matching the promised lead time. However, historical samples show a significant upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). As we are now in Period 2, I expect demand to increase significantly based on the historical sample sequence. Since the actual Period 1 demand (134) was higher than the historical Period 1 sample (107), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I am projecting demand to follow the sample trajectory but adjusted for the higher starting point. For Period 2, the sample is 252. I will set mu_hat based on the anticipation of this growth while keeping L at the default (0) as verified by the Period 1 conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3953.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is showing a clear upward trend (P1: 134, P2: 225, User History: P1:107, P2:252, P3:298, P4:376, P5:544). *Note: The user-provided list and the game history differ; I will prioritize the system-generated game history which shows demand increasing significantly from 134 to 225.* The promised lead time is 0, which has been confirmed by actual arrivals in P1 and P2 (lead_time was 0 periods). Because demand is increasing rapidly, using 'default' or a large 'N' would underestimate needs. I will use a small N (N=2) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this growth momentum directly. With an on-hand inventory of 322 and demand already hitting 225, we need to ensure the base stock covers at least the next period's expected high demand (~300+ units) to avoid stockouts. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these aggressive recent averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6118.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 status: on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0, and the previous period (P3) ended in a stockout (sold 322 vs. demand 338). Demand is showing a clear upward trend: 134 -> 225 -> 338. A significant regime shift or seasonal ramp-up is occurring. My internal data also shows a P4 demand of 376 and P5 of 544, which confirms a very steep growth pattern for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand is currently 0, I must order aggressively to cover both the upcoming period's demand and ensure safe baseline levels. Lead time is confirmed as 0 (same-period arrival) from Periods 1 and 2. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to capture the sharp forecasted increase to 544 for the next execution cycle, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility associated with this growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Rapid upward trend detected. Demand increased from ~134 (P1) to ~338 (P3), a +150% growth over 3 periods. Expecting continued steep growth into P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5638.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong upward trend, though with a slight correction in P4 (316) compared to P3 (338). Historical demand: P1:107, P2:252, P3:298, P4:376, P5:544. Wait, the prompt history shows P1:134, P2:225, P3:338, P4:316. I must use the 'GAME HISTORY' values. The average demand of the last 3 periods is roughly 293 units. However, given the P5 observed sample in the 'HISTORICAL' section is 544, there is a clear acceleration. With an on-hand inventory of 366 and a lead time of 0 (demonstrated in P1, P2, and P4), the system provides same-period arrivals. To avoid the stockout seen in P3, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the recent peak and growth trend. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 captures the current high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in the growth phase. L remains default as 0 is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand moved from ~134 to over 300 units; P5 demand sample (544) indicates accelerated growth or seasonal peak starting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7448.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 5 reaching 479 (sold 392 due to stockout). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544 - note: historical provided differs slightly from game history conclude messages, I will rely on the conclude messages: 134, 225, 338, 316, 479) show a clear growth trajectory. The average demand of the last 3 periods is approx 377. Since Period 5 resulted in a stockout (sold 392, demand 479), the true demand is significantly higher than inventory levels. Given the steep growth and the fact that lead time is consistently 0, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Forecasting Period 6 demand at around 550 to account for continued growth/seasonality. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this growth phase (Std Dev of last 3 periods is ~86). Setting L=0 as observed consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 3-5 demand average is ~377, with Period 5 demand (479) confirming a high-growth regime or seasonal peak. Stockouts occurred in P3 and P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11605.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show an aggressive upward trend, with the last three periods recording 316, 479, and 616 units respectively. Period 6 demand (616) represents a significant increase from the previous periods. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift, but the magnitude of growth is accelerating (roughly +30% period-over-period recently). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 99, which is very low compared to the current demand level. To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P3 and P5), I'm setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 750 (approx. 20% growth over P6) to stay ahead of the trend, as 'recent_N' would lag behind this steep growth. Sigma is set high using 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increasing volatility associated with these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerating: Period 6 demand (616) shows a sustained upward trend with an average growth of ~30% over the last 3 periods. Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12742.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Demand in Period 7 reached 687 units, following 616 in Period 6 and 479 in Period 5. This represents a sustained growth regime where demand has nearly doubled in four periods. The average demand over the last three periods (P5-P7) is ~594, but the most recent observation of 687 suggests we must prepare for >750 units in Period 8. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline of 800 to account for continued growth and provide a buffer against stockouts, which have already occurred twice (P3, P5). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect the increasing volatility typical of high-growth phases.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 5-7 average is 594 units, with a 43% increase from P5 to P7. Trend suggests Period 8 demand could exceed 750 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14953.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a strong upward trend. Historical data shows demand has increased from 134 in Period 1 to 800 in Period 8. The most recent three periods (P6-P8) have demands of 616, 687, and 800, averaging 701 units. The trend shows a fairly consistent period-over-period growth of approximately 10-15%. Based on this, Period 9 demand is likely to reach or exceed 900 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline demand that accounts for this forecasted growth (approx 920 units for the next period, and since L=0, the formula uses (1+0)*forecast), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility. Order calculation will aim to cover this growth while accounting for the 247 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 6-8 average is 701, with P8 demand (800) representing a 16% increase over P7. The growth trajectory remains steep.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17787.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong linear upward trend. The last four periods of demand are: P6: 616, P7: 687, P8: 800, P9: 943. This represents a consistent growth of approximately 10-18% per period. The Period 9 growth was 17.8% over Period 8. Forecasted demand for Period 10, following this trajectory (943 * 1.15), is approximately 1,084 units. Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. To avoid stockouts which occurred in P3 and P5, I will use the 'explicit' method to forecast a mu_hat reflective of the current trend (1,100 units). I will set sigma_hat at a level that accounts for the increasing volatility seen during this high-growth phase, using the recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 7-9 demand average is 810, with P9 demand (943) representing a 17.8% increase over P8. The growth trajectory remains steep and linear.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the chips(Regular) SKU continues to exhibit a strong, nearly linear upward trend. Periodic demand has increased from 134 in Period 1 to 1,021 in Period 10. The average demand over the last three periods (P8-P10) is 921 units, while the growth from P9 to P10 was approximately 8.3%. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth regime, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value that projects the growth trend into Period 11. Given the P10 demand of 1,021 and the recent momentum, I am forecasting mu_hat for the (L+1) period (where L=0) at 1,120 units. I am setting L to 'calculate' as historical lead times consistently show 0 periods. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent volatility in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 8-10 demand average is 921, with P10 demand (1021) showing continued linear growth (~8% over P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $22575.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong, linear upward trend in demand. The demand for Period 11 was 1194, an increase of approximately 17% over Period 10 (1021). The average demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) is 1052.6, while the demand growth rate over the last five periods has been consistently positive. Given the zero lead time, the inventory must cover the demand within the same period. To account for the continuing steep growth, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the trend (1021 -> 1194), a forecast for Period 12 is approximately 1360 (1194 + 173 linear increase). I will set mu_hat to 1360. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility during this high-growth phase. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 9-11 demand average is 1052.6, with P11 demand (1194) showing a 17% increase over P10, maintaining the steep upward trajectory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong linear upward trend. Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has been 943, 1021, 1194, and 1137, averaging 1074 units per period. Although P12 saw a slight dip from P11, it remains significantly higher than earlier periods. Looking at the trend from P8 (800) to P11 (1194), there's a growth of approximately 100-150 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime, ensuring the mean represents the latest levels. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 12 conclude'. The OR backend's service level (target quantile) for this SKU is very high (~95% given $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), which is appropriate given the risk of stockouts during this growth phase. I will stick to 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the backend to respond to the high mean and volatility observed in this latest regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains high but showed first sign of stabilization in Period 12 (1137 vs 1194 in P11). Period 9-12 average demand is 1073.75.

Daily Profit: $23940.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $23940.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand reached a new peak of 1381, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms the demand growth trend is still active despite a slight dip in P12. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is (1194 + 1137 + 1381) / 3 = 1237.33. Given the linear growth observed throughout the game, I expect Period 14 demand to exceed 1400. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To prevent another stockout and capture the high profit margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1500 (approximating 1.1x the current peak to account for continued growth and safety) and increasing sigma_hat to 150 to account for the high volatility seen in recent periods (ranging from 1137 to 1381).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-accelerated in Period 13: Demand reached a new high of 1381 units after a brief stabilization in P12. Average demand for P11-P13 is 1237.3, representing a 15% increase over the previous three-period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24773.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend with significant growth observed over the last several periods. Demand in Period 13 reached a new high of 1381, and while Period 14 saw a slight decrease to 1326, it remains well above previous levels. The average demand over the last three periods (P12-P14) is approximately 1281 units. Given the historical growth pattern, I expect demand in Period 15 to stay in the 1300-1450 range. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period so far. Since current on-hand inventory is 421 units and the system satisfies demand after the arrival resolution, I will set mu_hat to 1450 to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential demand and avoid the stockouts seen in P3, P5, and P13. I'll maintain a sigma_hat that reflects the recent volatility (standard deviation of the last 3 periods is approx 128, sqrt(1+L)*std is roughly that).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains high: Average demand for P12-P14 is 1281.3, representing a sustained high-level demand regime despite a minor dip in P14 (1326).

Daily Reward (R_t): $31559.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. In Period 15, demand surged to 1672 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The moving average of the last 3 periods (P13-P15) is 1459.7 units, compared to the P10-P12 average of 1117.3 units, confirming a ~30% growth over that interval. To prevent further stockouts and capture this growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I forecast Period 16 demand to be approximately 1750-1800 units based on the recent trajectory. Since lead time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock (1+L) must cover this forecast. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1800 to ensure the backend orders enough to cover the expected peak, and an explicit sigma_hat of 200 to account for recent high volatility (the jump from 1326 to 1672).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 15: Demand reached 1672 units, a 26% increase over P14 (1326). Average demand for P13-P15 is 1460 units, confirming the growth regime is still active after the brief P12/P14 fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28711.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Most recently, Period 15 hit 1672 units and Period 16 was 1542 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is 1513 units. However, the overall trajectory over the last 10 periods suggests that demand is growing at approximately 10-15% every few periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts, which occurred in P15 and P13, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 1800. This value accounts for the current 3-period average (~1513) plus a buffer for the observed growth trend (approx. 15-20% growth). Given the volatility and the steep slope of the trend, I am setting sigma_hat to an explicit value of 250 to ensure a high service level, especially since the profit per unit ($19) is much higher than the holding cost ($1). L is set to default as the confirmed lead time across all history is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 14-16 demand average is 1513 units. Despite a slight dip in P16 (1542) from P15 (1672), the long-term trend remains sharply upward, increasing nearly 10x from Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31528.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, which has persisted for 17 periods. Period 17 demand reached 1687 units, surpassing the previous high and maintaining the growth trajectory. The average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 1634 units. However, given the sustained linear growth observed since the beginning, setting \u03bc\u0302 based on the most recent 3 periods (recent_N=3) is the most reactive strategy to prevent stockouts while reflecting the current high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'concluded' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the average of the most recent peak levels (1672, 1542, 1687), and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to provide a slightly broader view of volatility during this high-growth phase to protect against the higher demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 15-17 demand average is 1633.7, with P17 demand (1687) marking a new high-point in the trend after a brief fluctuation. Growth trajectory remains consistently upward despite periodic variance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trend. Period 18 saw demand reach 1793, a new peak. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is 1674, compared to the P13-P15 average of 1460, representing a 14.6% increase. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To account for the ongoing growth and prevent further stockouts (which have occurred in periods 3, 5, 13, and 15), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent, highest-demand regime. This provides the OR engine with the most current trend data to set the base stock for Period 19, where demand is expected to approach or exceed 1800-1900 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 16-18 demand average is 1674. Period 18 demand (1793) reached a new high, representing a 6% increase over P17. The trajectory remains consistently upward with periodic volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35758.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, nearly linear upward trend with a 10.7% increase in Period 19 (1986) compared to Period 18 (1793). This resulted in a stockout in Period 19 as demand exceeded the available supply (on-hand + arriving in-period). Lead time is consistently 0. To capture this aggressive growth and provide sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts (which have occurred in periods 3, 5, 13, 15, and 19), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent high-demand periods (P17-P19 avg: 1822) heavily. However, since the trend is clearly increasing and P19 demand already reached 1986, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, targeting 2100 units to proactively accommodate the next step in the growth trajectory. sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 17-19 demand average is 1822 units, with P19 demand (1986) showing a 10.7% increase over P18. Stockout occurred in P19. The growth trajectory remains steep and consistent.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, despite a periodic dip in Period 20 (1875 units, down from 1986 in Period 19). The 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1884.7 units, and the 5-period average (P16-P20) is 1776.6 units. Given the consistent growth and frequent stockouts (P13, P15, P19), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the most recent high-demand regime. Using N=3 for sigma_hat provides a localized estimate of volatility during this high-volume stage, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37856.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 21 demand reached 1995, following a slight dip in P20 (1875) and a peak in P19 (1986). The 3-period average (P19-P21) is 1952 units, compared to the previous 3-period average (P16-P18) of 1674 units, representing a 16.6% growth. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this growth and avoid further stockouts (observed in P13, P15, and P19 when demand spiked above on-hand levels), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation is weighted toward the current high-demand regime rather than the lower historical averages. Since L=0, the target base stock must cover the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 19-21 demand average is 1952 units. Period 21 demand (1995) confirms the upward trajectory persists after a brief stabilization in P20. Trend indicates Period 22 demand likely exceeding 2100 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a sustained and steep linear growth pattern. Demand has increased from 134 in Period 1 to 2218 in Period 22, representing a 16x increase. The most recent demand (2218) resulted in another stockout, as inventory levels failed to keep pace with the ~11% growth from Period 21. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is approximately 2029 units, but given the trajectory (P20: 1875, P21: 1995, P22: 2218), a forward-looking forecast must account for continued expansion. Setting L to 0 (promised), mu_hat specifically to 2450 to cover the projected Period 23 demand plus a buffer for growth, and sigma_hat to 150 to account for recent volatility and prevent stockouts. A higher mu_hat is used to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the current rising demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 20-22 average is 2029 units, with P22 demand (2218) reflecting an 11% increase over P21. Stockout occurred in P22. Trend remains sharply upward.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, nearly linear upward trend. In Period 23, demand reached 2,449 units, which is a 10.4% increase over Period 22 (2,218) and significantly higher than the previous three-period average (P20-22) of 2,029 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this relentless growth and minimize the risk of stockouts during this high-growth regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most current demand trajectory (averaging P21-23). This ensures the base stock reflects the current volume of ~2,220 units per period. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility associated with higher demand levels. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 21-23 average is 2,220 units, with P23 demand (2,449) representing a 10.4% increase over P22. The linear growth regime remains intact.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear upward trend. Period 24 demand was 2,460 units, showing a slight stabilization compared to Period 23 (2,449), but the underlying growth regime remains intact. The three-period average (P22-P24) is approximately 2,376 units. To support the high service level required by the profit margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the most recent demand levels while accounting for the ongoing growth trajectory. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand spike for Period 25. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival resolution.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 22-24 average is 2,376 units, with Period 24 demand (2,460) confirming the current high-demand regime remains stable or slightly increasing.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, though Period 25 (2309 units) showed a slight dip compared to the previous peak in Period 24 (2460 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility and sustained growth, I am using a recent_N approach with N=3. This focuses on the most recent demand levels (Avg: 2406) ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current scale of operations. The OR backend's service level (z-score) will be naturally high due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which is appropriate given the history of stockouts and the continuing growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand growth remains high with the average of the last three periods (P23-P25) at 2406 units. While P25 demand (2309) was slightly lower than P24, the overall regime remains at peak levels.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-volume regime. The most recent demand samples are P23: 2449, P24: 2460, P25: 2309, and P26: 2427. The average of the last four periods is approximately 2411 units, indicating that the previously steep linear growth has transitioned into a high-level stable or slightly fluctuating regime around the 2400-unit mark. The lead time consistently remains 0. Inventory levels are lean (118 on-hand), and the OR backend parameters need to account for this stable but high-volume demand to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current consolidated peak regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L=0 default.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has transitioned from linear growth to a high-volume stabilization regime starting Period 23, averaging ~2411 units (P23-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a rapid growth phase into a high-volume stabilization regime. Over the last five periods (P23-P27), demand has averaged 2,442 units. Period 27 demand (2,565) resulted in a stockout as it exceeded available inventory. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To ensure adequate service levels and avoid further stockouts in this high-volume stage, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current plateau, while slightly increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility observed in this higher demand range (stretching from 2,309 to 2,565). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer appropriate for the current volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 23-27 average demand is 2,442 units, signaling a shift from linear growth to a high-volume plateau regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a linear growth phase to a high-volume regime. In Period 28, demand reached 2,733 units, following 2,565 in Period 27, suggesting the previously observed plateau (~2,400-2,500 units) may still be shifting slightly upwards or exhibiting higher volatility. The last two periods resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that the current ordering strategy is slightly undershooting the peak demand. To address this, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (covering P23-P28) to capture the current high-volume regime while acknowledging the recent spikes. $L$ remains at 'default' as lead time is consistently 0. Setting $\mu_{hat}$ and $\sigma_{hat}$ via 'recent_N' with N=6 allows the OR backend to calculate base stock levels that better reflect the current demand distribution and provide a sufficient buffer against stockouts during this peak period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has broken out of its short-term stabilization (P23-P27) and is accelerating again. Demand in Period 28 (2733) and Period 29 (2915) shows a significant upward jump compared to the previous plateau of ~2442 units. We have encountered consecutive stockouts in P27, P28, and P29 because the order quantities (capped by the OR backend's internal logic) were insufficient to meet this renewed growth spurt. To address this, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg = 2738) and will set sigma_hat using an explicit value of 300. This higher sigma_hat is intended to increase the Safety Stock (z*sigma), helping the capped policy produce a base stock high enough to prevent another stockout while acknowledging the lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-accelerated starting Period 28: After a stabilization regime (P23-P27), demand jumped to 2733 (P28) and 2915 (P29), indicating the start of a new growth phase or a peak seasonal surge.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new significantly higher regime. After a plateau around 2,400 units (P23-P27), demand jumped to 2,733 (P28) and 2,915 (P29), followed by 2,866 in P30. This suggests a new average near 2,850-2,900 units. The previous stabilization period has clearly ended, and the stockouts in P27, P28, and P29 necessitate a more aggressive forecast to prevent lost sales, especially since lead time is 0. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new elevated plateau (averaging 2,838 units) and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover this growth while accounting for the recent high volatility (sigma). Lead time remains 0 as confirmed by the P30 conclude message (ordered P30, arrived P30).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-accelerated starting Period 28: New regime established averaging ~2,838 units (P28-P30), up from the ~2,442 stabilization plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56867.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 31 demand reached 3137, following a sequence of 2733, 2915, and 2866. This confirms a new high-growth regime starting around Period 28. The current average demand for the last four periods (P28-P31) is approximately 2913 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the priority is avoiding stockouts during this acceleration. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest growth regime (P28-P31), which provides an expected demand (1+L) of around 2913. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility observed in this higher volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime re-confirmed: Average demand for P28-P31 is ~2913, reflecting a ~19% increase over the previous P23-P27 stabilization plateau (~2442). Growth remains active.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volume growth regime that re-accelerated around Period 28. The average demand over the last five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 2,910 units [2733, 2915, 2866, 3137, 2897], compared to the previous stabilization plateau of ~2,442. Despite a slight dip in Period 32 (2897) from Period 31 (3137), the levels remain significantly higher than the previous regime. Multiple stockouts (P27, P28, P29, P31) indicate that the supply is barely keeping up with the rapid demand increases. The Lead Time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. To capture the current higher state and account for volatility, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to focus on the post-acceleration regime (P28-P32). I will also use recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in this higher volume phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts in a high-reward environment (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime re-confirmed: Average demand for P28-P32 is ~2910 units, representing a sustained ~19% increase over the P23-P27 stabilization plateau (~2442). Consistent lead time of 0 periods persists.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a stabilization plateau of ~2,442 units (P23-P27) to a new high-growth regime starting P28. Current demand in P33 reached 3,332 units, resulting in a stockout. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P31-P33) is approximately 3,122 units, and the average for the current growth regime (P28-P33) is ~2,980 units. Given the persistent stockouts (P31, P33) and the clear upward trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this most recent surge, while using a slightly wider sigma_hat (recent 5 samples) to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P28-P33): Average demand increased to ~2,980 (up ~22% from the P23-P27 plateau). Peak demand of 3,332 recorded in P33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a stabilization plateau around 2,442 units (P23-P27) to a new high-growth regime starting P28. The average demand for the last seven periods (P28-P34) is approximately 2,956 units, with a peak of 3,332 in P33 and a relatively high 3,213 in P34. Because the product is entering a high-volume phase and has experienced several stockouts (P27, P28, P29, P31, P33), I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this specific post-plateau growth phase (P28 onwards). This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~3,000 unit demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to appropriately weight the higher volatility observed in this current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P28-P34): Average demand increased to ~2,956 (up ~21% from the P23-P27 stabilization plateau). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a stabilization plateau of ~2,442 (P23-P27) to a new high-growth regime averaging ~3,034 over the last 8 periods (P28-P35). Period 35 demand (3,490) represents a new peak and resulted in a stockout, as on-hand inventory was insufficient. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for this ongoing growth and the frequent stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand peak (3,490) plus a 10% growth buffer to ensure higher service levels and prevent lost sales in Period 36. This addresses the consistent pattern of actual demand exceeding the previous period's order/inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P28-P35) confirmed with an average of 3,034 units (~24% increase over P23-P27 plateau). Demand reached a new peak of 3,490 in P35, indicating the growth phase is still active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70689.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 3,748 units in Period 36. This marks a significant increase from the previous periods, indicating that the growth phase identified in Period 28 is still active and potentially accelerating. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is approximately 3,484 units, which is a clear shift from the previous average. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive to satisfy this period's demand. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting the detection window to the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) to capture the accelerating trend. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the increasing volatility associated with higher volume. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime (P28-P36) remains active: Period 36 demand reached a new peak of 3,748 units. The average for the last three periods (P34-P36) is ~3,484 units, a 17% increase over the P28-P33 average (~2,980).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a stabilization plateau (~2442 units in P23-P27) to a new growth regime. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is approximately 3627 units, with a peak of 3748 in P36. The most recent demand in P37 (3643) remains consistently high. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. To capture this sustained growth phase and prevent stockouts seen in recent periods (P31, P33, P35), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering the re-accelerated growth since P34). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high-volume demand rather than the lower historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime (P34-P37) confirmed: Average demand for the last 4 periods is ~3524, a ~19% increase over the P28-P33 average (~2956). Lead time remains 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volume growth regime. Over the most recent five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 3,493 units, with a peak of 3,748 in P36. Period 38 saw a slight reduction to 3,371 units, but the overall trajectory remains significantly higher than the previous stabilization plateau. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving within the same period it was placed. To avoid stockouts which have occurred frequently during growth spurts (P27, P28, P29, P31, P33, P35), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (P34-P38) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' reflecting the (1+L) periods (total 1 period) is based on the most current demand regime of ~3,500 units, while accounting for the increased variance seen in this high-growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71997.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established high-volume growth regime. Period 39 demand was 3,792, keeping the recent three-period average (P37-P39) at 3,602 units, which is a significant increase over the P28-P33 average of ~2,956. The growth appears to be reaching a new peak or plateau slightly above 3,500. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels remain lean with frequent near-stockouts (ending on-hand of 51 in P39). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime shift that started around Period 34, allowing the model to adapt to the current demand level of ~3,500 while accounting for the high volatility observed in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P34-P39) confirmed: Average demand is ~3,533 units, representing a 19.5% increase over the previous P28-P33 plateau (~2,956). Peak demand of 3,792 reached in P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74385.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and rapid upward trajectory throughout the game, with a recent acceleration starting in Period 34. In Period 40, demand reached a new peak of 4,106 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 3,915, ending inventory 0). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is approximately 3,756 units, which is a significant increase over the previous plateau. Given the persistent growth trend and the stockout in P40, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P34-P40), which averages ~3,669 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current peak. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to appropriately capture the increasing volatility associated with this higher demand volume. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as history confirms a consistent 0-period lead time. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P34-P40) confirmed: Average demand is ~3,669 units, up from the ~2,956 average in the P28-P33 period. Peak demand reached 4,106 in P40, sustaining the long-term growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78089.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong linear upward trend. Over the most recent eight periods (P34-P41), the demand average has shifted to approximately 3,669 units, with the most recent two periods (P40, P41) consistently exceeding 4,100 units. A stockout occurred in P40, and P41 ending inventory was nearly zero (1 unit), confirming that the current supply is just barely meeting the accelerating demand. Given the sustained growth pattern observed throughout the game (from ~134 in P1 to ~4,110 in P41), I will use an 'explicit' demand forecast (mu_hat) for Period 42. Taking the last two periods as the new baseline (~4,108) and accounting for the ~5% average period-over-period growth seen in the recent high-demand regime, I forecast Period 42 demand at approximately 4,310 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this aggressive growth phase, I will set sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=8) to capture the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Period 40-41 demand averaged 4,108 units, representing a 12% increase over the P34-P39 average (~3,669). The long-term growth trajectory remains steep and consistent with recent linear acceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83577.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, nearly linear upward trend. Period 42 demand reached 4,421 units, confirming the acceleration noted in the carry-over insights. Over the last three periods (P40-P42), the average demand is approximately 4,212 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by Period 42's order arriving within the same period. To account for this ongoing growth and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 19:1), which justifies a high service level (~95%), I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to 4,500 units. This 'explicit' value is slightly above the most recent sample to proactively buffer against the clear growth trend and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 40 and earlier. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to capture the recent volatility and ensure adequate safety stock during this rapid expansion phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 40-42 demand average is 4,212 units, with P42 (4,421) showing a 7.5% increase over P41. The linear growth trajectory is sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75926.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a steep upward trajectory, though Period 43 (4,046) showed a slight dip compared to Period 42 (4,421). The average demand for the most recent regime (P40-P43) is approximately 4,171 units. Given the consistent historical pattern of linear growth followed by brief plateaus, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods to capture this high-volume regime. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to account for recent volatility, which has increased as the volume scaled. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory is 948 units, which will be subtracted from the base stock calculated by the OR backend to determine the final order. Using recent_N=4 for demand ensures we are responsive to the current volume level while smoothing the slight dip in P43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P40-P43) average established at ~4,171 units, representing a sustained high-volume phase after the previous P34-P39 plateau (~3,533). Growth remains the dominant trend despite occasional single-period fluctuations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to demonstrate a strong, sustained upward trajectory. The average demand over the last five periods (P40-P44) is approximately 4,215 units, with the most recent demand (P44) hitting 4,388. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period in the history. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent acceleration (P42=4421, P43=4046, P44=4388, avg=4285). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to provide a robust volatility measure that accounts for the fluctuations seen during this growth phase. The service level naturally targeted by the OR backend (95% based on profit/holding ratio) is appropriate given the low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 40-44 demand average is ~4,215 units, indicating the current high-volume growth regime is stable. Linear upward trend persists despite periodic fluctuations.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term linear growth trajectory with a recent stabilization around ~4,400 units. Period 45 demand was 4,407, and the average for the most recent regime (P42-P45) is approximately 4,315 units. There have been no reported issues with delivery; all historical orders have concluded with a lead time of 0 periods. To maximize profit and prevent stockouts (which have occurred frequently throughout the game history when inventory was tight), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect a slight continuation of the growth trend, targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~4,500 units for the next period. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively represents the target base stock level (1+0)*Demand. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 300 to account for the observed volatility in the current high-demand regime, ensuring a robust service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing at new high: Period 42-45 demand average is ~4,316 units, representing a stable high-volume regime following the linear growth phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84326.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a high-growth linear phase to a high-volume stabilization plateau starting around Period 42. The average demand for the most recent five periods (P42-P46) is 4,425.6 units. Period 46 demand was 4,466, confirming this new regime. On-hand inventory is 528 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, ensuring that orders placed in the current period arrive in time to satisfy that same period's demand. To optimize the service level and minimize holding costs in this high-volume environment, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the stable regime P42-P46) and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the current volatility (std dev for P42-P46 is approx 158). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the ~4,400+ unit demand while avoiding excessive leftover inventory as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at approximately 4,425 units (P42-P46 average), following the previous linear growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84734.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a sharp linear growth phase into a stable high-volume plateau. Over the last six periods (P42-P47), demand has averaged 4,432 units, with very low variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 210). Specifically, the last three periods (P45-P47) have been remarkably consistent, with demand values of 4,407, 4,466, and 4,468. This confirms the plateau identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. To optimize for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0:$1.0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture this stable plateau and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect the significantly reduced volatility in this regime compared to the earlier growth phases. This approach ensures high service levels while minimizing unnecessary excess stock as the game nears its end in Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau stabilized: Period 42-47 average demand is 4,432 units with significantly reduced volatility compared to the growth phase. High-volume regime confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87970.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent long-term upward trajectory, though recent periods (P42-P48) suggest a transition into a high-volume stabilization regime around 4,400-4,500 units. However, Period 48 saw a significant demand spike to 4,822, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests either a re-acceleration of growth or higher-than-expected volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent future stockouts while demand sits at these peak levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the behavior since the P42 plateau began, but I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=10) to better account for the volatility seen in the transition and the recent spike. This approach ensures the base stock level is responsive to the high volume while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-acceleration or high volatility: Period 48 demand (4,822) exceeded the P42-P47 plateau average (4,432) by ~9%, resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93271.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of re-acceleration or high volatility, as evidenced by Period 48 (4,822) and Period 49 (5,048), both significantly exceeding the previous plateau average of ~4,432 units. The last two periods resulted in stockouts, indicating that the 'default' and 'recent_N' methods (calculating averages) are currently lagging behind the actual demand realization. To capture this upward surge and prevent further lost sales in the final period (Period 50), I am selecting the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the model to the most recent behavior (P47-P49 average is ~4,779) while accounting for the increased volatility (from ~4,400 to over 5,000). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages. By focusing on the last 3 periods, we provide a higher base stock to cover the current growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-acceleration confirmed in P48-P49: Demand reached 5,048 in P49, a 14% increase over the P42-P47 plateau average (4,432), leading to consecutive stockouts.
