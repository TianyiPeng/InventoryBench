Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), showing a clear and strong upward trend (growth regime). The promised lead time is 0. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to place an order immediately to cover the expected demand for the current period (since arrivals happen before demand resolution in the same period for L=0). Given the sharp growth, the average of all samples (315) will significantly underestimate the next period's demand (last sample was 544). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline that accounts for this growth, forecasting Period 6 demand at approximately 650. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility during this growth phase. Lead time is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 650 units with a promised lead time of 0 periods, and they arrived immediately (lead_time was 0). Demand in Period 1 was 134 units, leaving us with 516 units on-hand. Historical demand samples are [107, 252, 298, 376, 544], showing a clear upward trend. However, the system just recorded an actual demand of 134 in Period 1, which is low compared to the later historical samples but consistent with the very first sample. Given the strong historical growth (from 107 to 544), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand components to capture the higher values seen in the historical series while balancing the lower Period 1 observation. Since lead time has been confirmed as 0 (consistent with promised), I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 134 and 225. Looking at the provided demand samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), there is a clear and sharp upward trend in demand. The mean of the first two samples (107, 252) is 179.5, which aligns closely with the actual observed demand (134, 225). The remaining samples (298, 376, 544) suggest demand will continue to grow significantly. Promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Currently, we have 291 units on hand. To prevent stockouts against the upcoming demand spike (Period 3 sample is 298), I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=2) to capture the trend, but I will adjust the parameters to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the accelerating demand. Given the high growth, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to target the next expected demand level (~300+) and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture the increasing volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 134, Period 2 was 225, and Period 3 was 338. This shows a significant upward trend in demand. In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (sold 310 units with 310 on-hand, despite demand being 338). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, which has been consistent in P1 and P3. Given the rapid demand growth across only 3 periods, the 'default' or even 'recent_N' averages will likely underestimate the required base stock for Period 4. I will use 'explicit' values to anticipate continued growth. Average demand is currently ~232, but the most recent observation is 338. I expect Period 4 demand to be at least 400. To cover this and recover from zero inventory, I'll set mu_hat to (1+L)*450 = 450. I'll set a higher sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upward significantly (P1: 134, P2: 225, P3: 338). Standard averages are lagging.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong upward trend from Period 1 to Period 5, though Period 4 saw a slight dip (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 315.4. However, the most recent observation (P5: 544) is the highest yet, suggesting the 'recent_N' approach is best to capture this momentum. I will use N=3 to average the most recent high-demand periods (298, 376, 544), which averages to ~406 per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 and sigma_hat with N=3, I aim to provide the OR backend with parameters that reflect the current high-demand regime, ensuring base stock is high enough to satisfy immediate needs while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which targets a 50% service level/median demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 5 demand reached 544 units, continuing a significant upward trend from the initial periods. Average of last 3 periods (P3-P5) is 406 units vs. initial average of 180 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Historical demand for the first five periods is: 134, 225, 338, 316 (corrected from 376 in prompt history to 316 in Game History), and 479 (corrected from 544 in prompt history to 479 in Game History). Despite some data discrepancy in the prompt header vs game history, the trend is undeniably bullish. We have stocked out in Period 3 and Period 5, indicating that base stock levels are consistently too low. Lead time appears stable at 0 periods (same-day arrival confirmed in P1, P3, P4, P5). Since we are in a high-growth phase, using a simple mean will under-order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Mean of P3-P5 is approx 378). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the growth phase. This strategy aims to increase the base stock limit to prevent further lost sales during this expansion.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Periods 3-5 average demand is 377.7 units, significantly higher than Periods 1-2 average of 179.5. Stockouts occurred in 2 of the last 3 periods (P3, P5) due to lagging replenishment logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a sharp upward trend, increasing sequentially from Period 1 (134) to Period 6 (616), with the exception of a slight dip in P4. We have experienced three stockouts (P3, P5, P6) because the replenishment logic is not keeping pace with the growth. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Given the aggressive growth (P6 demand = 616), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to ensure we order enough to meet this rising demand and build a buffer. I estimate Period 7 demand will be at least ~700. Since Profit=HoldingCost ($1.00 each), the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock level simply targets the mean demand. However, the OR engine's 'cap' provides a safety buffer. To prevent another stockout, I'll set mu_hat to 700 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility seen in the growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth is accelerating: P1-P6 demands were 134, 225, 338, 316, 479, 616. Period 6 demand is 4.6x higher than Period 1. Stockouts in 50% of periods (P3, P5, P6) indicate that reactive historical averages are insufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $674.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. Historical samples provided (P1-P5) and actual concludes (P1-P7) show demand growing from 134 to 687 units. Stockouts occurred in Periods 3, 5, and 6 because previous order sizes were too reactive. Period 7 finally met demand with 687 units sold and 13 units remaining. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments to date (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) have arrived in the same period (L=0). To prevent further stockouts and capture the current growth, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (687) projected forward with a growth margin. mu_hat = (1+L) * 750 = 750 (since L=0). I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for high volatility during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the anticipated demand of the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 7 demand reached 687 units, representing a 5.1x increase from Period 1. Historical lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 6 orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $750.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing an aggressive, sustained linear growth trend. Demand over the last 8 periods has been 134, 225, 338, 316, 479, 616, 687, and 800. The current stockout in Period 8 (sold 750 vs demand 800) confirms that the previous order (737) was insufficient to meet the rising demand. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q=0.5), which is too conservative for a high-growth environment. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand spike, I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat based on the most recent demand (800) plus the observed growth rate (approx +100 units/period), resulting in a forecast of 900 for Period 9. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (L+1)=1 period. I will also set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high forecast error observed during this trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 8 (800 units), continuing a linear trend of ~100 unit increases per period since P4. The system has suffered stockouts in 5 out of 8 periods (P3, P5, P6, P8) due to the reactive nature of the base-stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $900.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, possibly linear, upward trend. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has been 479, 616, 687, 800, and 943 units respectively, showing an average increase of approximately 116 units per period. The last observation (943) is the highest yet, and the system has experienced stockouts in 6 out of 9 periods (P3, P5, P6, P8, P9) because the historical averages are lagging behind the actual demand. Crucially, the Lead Time (L) is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To prevent another stockout in Period 10, I must forecast demand for P10 by continuing the observed growth trend (~943 + 120 = 1063 units). Using 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat will bypass the trailing historical statistics produced by standard methods. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to provide a small buffer over the projected 1063, and set a high sigma_hat of 150 to account for the increasing volatility as demand scales.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and linear: Average demand increase is ~116 units/period over the last 4 periods (P6-P9). Stockouts occurred in 67% of periods (6/9). Actual Lead Time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $942.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive linear upward trend. Over the last five periods (P6-P10), demand was 616, 687, 800, 943, and 1021. This reflects a consistent growth of approximately 100+ units per period. The backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy which is reactive; with Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the engine targets the median demand (z=0). Because demand is rising so quickly, the historical mean always lags the actual requirement, leading to frequent stockouts (6 out of the last 10 periods). To prevent a stockout in Period 11, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to capture the expected demand of approximately 1150-1200 units. Given the trend (P9 to P10 was +78, but previous jumps were larger), I will forecast 1150 for Period 11. Since Lead Time (L) is confirmed at 0, mu_hat represents the demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains highly linear and aggressive: Period 6-10 demands (616, 687, 800, 943, 1021) show an average increase of ~101 units per period. Explicit forecasting is required to stay ahead of the trend as historical averages (even recent_N) are lagging.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive linear growth trend. Demand in Period 11 reached 1,194 units, maintaining a pattern where demand increases by approximately 100-150 units per period. Historical data (P6-P11: 616, 687, 800, 943, 1021, 1194) confirms this trend. Total on-hand inventory reached 0 at the end of Period 11, resulting in a stockout of approximately 44 units. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and stay ahead of the demand curve, I am setting the explicit mu_hat to 1,350 (targeting Period 12 demand + a growth buffer), and an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for increasing volatility. Since L=0, the backend base_stock formula is simply (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat); with profit=1 and holding=1, z is 0. Using explicit values ensures the order quantity is sufficient to cover the projected 1,300+ units for Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and approximately linear: Period 6-11 demands (616, 687, 800, 943, 1021, 1194) show a sustained upward trajectory with an average increase of ~115 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward linear trend. Over the last 6 periods, demand has evolved as follows: 616, 687, 800, 943, 1021, and 1194. However, Period 12 showed a slight dip to 1137. Despite this minor fluctuation, the mean demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is approximately 1074 units, with a clear trend-line suggesting Period 13 demand will likely exceed 1250 units. The critical issue remains that using historical averages (even recent_N) causes the inventory position to lag behind actual demand, leading to frequent stockouts (7 out of 12 periods). Actual lead time is consistently 0. To prevent stockouts, I am setting L to explicit 0 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1450. This value accounts for the expected trend (~1250-1300) plus a buffer to ensure availability, especially as the OR backend's capping logic often limits the final order. sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the volatility and the risk of the trend accelerating further.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained but showed its first minor deceleration in P12 (1137 units vs P11's 1194). Despite this, the overall trajectory since P1 is strongly linear (~ +100 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1312.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward linear trend. Although Period 12 showed a slight dip, Period 13 reached a new high of 1381 units. Over the last 6 periods (P8-P13), demand has progressed: 800, 943, 1021, 1194, 1137, 1381. This represents an average growth of approximately 116 units per period since P8. To prevent stockouts, which have occurred in 7 of the last 13 periods, I need to set mu_hat aggressively. Given a lead time of 0, mu_hat represents the (1+L) period demand forecast for Period 14. Projecting the trend from P13 (1381) with an average increment of ~115 leads to a forecast of ~1500 units. I will use 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover this forecasted 1500 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 150 to account for recent volatility observed in P11 and P12.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Linear growth trend remains dominant with demand hitting a new high of 1381 in P13. Average period-over-period growth since P8 is approximately 116 units. The product has suffered stockouts in 54% of historical periods (7/13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1152.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth trend. Last period (P14) saw demand at 1326 units, following 1381 in P13, 1137 in P12, and 1194 in P11. Although there are slight fluctuations (P12 and P14 being slightly lower than their predecessors), the overall trajectory suggests demand will likely rebound toward the 1450-1550 range. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid the frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods (occurring in ~50% of the game so far), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1550 to stay ahead of the growth curve. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent volatility observed in the last 4 periods (range ~250 units). Current on-hand is 174, so an explicit forecast will trigger a replenishment order of approximately 1376 units, ensuring sufficient stock for Period 15's demand resolution.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains dominant but volatile: average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 1211 units, compared to 813 units for P5-P9. Growth is roughly +100 units/period despite occasional one-period dips.

Daily Profit: $1550.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1550.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 15 reached a new historical high of 1672 units, confirming a massive resurgence in the upward trend after two periods of slight cooling. The current pattern shows extreme growth: P13 (1381), P14 (1326), and P15 (1672). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods. To prevent another stockout (as occurred in P15 where on-hand was 1550 vs 1672 demand), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1800 to cover the likely next step in this growth trajectory. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (higher than standard deviation) to provide a safety buffer against the volatile +300 unit jump observed in P15. These parameters (L=0, mu=1800, sigma=250) will target a base stock level that accounts for the persistent stockout risk in this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly alongside growth: Period 15 demand (1672) spiked by 346 units (+26%) from Period 14, following two periods of plateau. Growth remains sustained but less linear and more episodic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1284.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, characterized by a mix of steady growth and episodic spikes. Period 15 saw a massive spike to 1672 units, followed by 1542 units in Period 16. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 1412 units, while the average across the last 3 periods (P14-P16) is 1513 units. Given the persistent stockouts (8 out of 16 periods) and the tendency for historical averages to lag behind this linear growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1750. This accounts for the target service level and the anticipated growth for Period 17, assuming a continued upward trend from the Period 15 peak. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the increased volatility observed in the last two periods (+/- 100-300 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted from relative linearity to higher variance spikes: P15 saw a 26% jump (1672) followed by a Period 16 demand of 1542, creating a new regime average of approximately 1500+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1624.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a strong upward trend with high volatility. We are currently in a high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) being approximately 1634 units. Period 17 demand was 1687, following 1542 in P16 and a peak of 1672 in P15. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning we want our base stock to meet the median demand. However, due to the consistent linear growth (+100 to +115 units per period) and the high stockout frequency (P3, P5, P6, P8, P9, P11, P15), a historical average or simple recent_N will lag behind actual demand. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the target for the current period at 1800 units, which accounts for the current mean (~1634) plus the expected growth increment (~115) and a small buffer for volatility. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has transitioned from linear to a high-volatility regime around a mean of ~1630 units (Periods 15-17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-volatility, high-growth regime. Period 18 demand reached 1793 units, following a sequence (P15-P17) of 1672, 1542, and 1687. The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is approximately 1674 units, with a noticeable upward bias. The current base-stock policy has led to stockouts or near-stockouts (ending inventory < 10 units) in 4 of the last 8 periods, indicating that historical averages are still lagging. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To capture the current trajectory and ensure availability, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the 1674 average, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increased volatility (100+ unit swings). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 1700-1800 unit range required to meet current peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high-volatility plateau: P15-P18 average is 1674 units (+100% vs P9). Period-over-period variance has increased, requiring shorter lead-time forecasting windows (N=4) to prevent stockouts.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak of 1986 units in Period 19, continuing a strong upward trajectory. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 1736 units, but the most recent 3 periods show a higher average of 1822 units, with P19 specifically jumping by nearly 200 units from P18. The system has experienced stockouts in 2 of the last 5 periods (P15, P19) because historical averages are lagging behind this aggressive growth. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To capture the current growth and avoid a stockout in Period 20, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to prioritize the most recent acceleration, while using sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (std dev) observed in the current high-demand regime. This provides a balance between following the trend and protecting against high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a record high of 1986 in Period 19. Average of last 3 periods (P17-P19) is 1822, representing an 11% increase over the previous 5-period average (P12-P16: 1634). Actual Lead Time remains 0.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trend, achieving a new local high in volatility with demand reaching 1875 units in Period 20, following a record 1986 units in Period 19. The last 3 periods (P18-P20) average 1885 units. However, the system has consistently under-ordered, resulting in stockouts in 4 of the last 6 periods (P15, P18, P19, P20) because the reactive base-stock policy lags behind this growth. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To minimize stockouts and capture the current growth regime, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast. Given the trajectory from P17 (1687) to P20 (observed 1875, but likely higher potential demand due to stockout), I am forecasting demand for Period 21 at 2050 units. Setting L to 0 (promised) and sigma_hat to explicit 250 to account for increased volatility and prevent under-ordering in the face of record-breaking demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P18-P20 average demand is 1885 units, but stockouts in P18, P19, and P20 suggest true demand is likely >2000 units. Period-over-period growth is approximately 100-150 units in the current high-volatility regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, with Period 21 demand reaching 1995 units. We have experienced chronic stockouts (62% of periods) because historical averages and even recent_N methods have lagged behind this rapid growth. The actual lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further lost sales in this aggressive growth environment, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 2150 units. This value is based on the recent trend (P19: 1986, P20: 1875, P21: 1995) plus a buffer to account for the clear latent demand that likely exceeded our stock levels in previous periods. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period. sigma_hat is set to 250 using 'explicit' to account for high volatility observed in this regime (the standard deviation over the last 5 periods is approx 160, so 250 allows for the OR backend's safety stock calculation to be sufficiently robust).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Period 19-21 average demand is 1952 units. Systematic stockouts persist as demand consistently tests the upper bounds of available inventory. Latent demand is estimated to be >2100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2150.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively, with Period 22 demand reaching a new high of 2218, causing yet another stockout (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median of the demand distribution for the lead-review period. However, given the sustained linear growth and frequent stockouts, using standard historical averages (even recent_N) consistently lags behind actual demand. Over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has been {1986, 1875, 1995, 2218}, showing a clear upward shift. To capture this momentum and prevent further stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast. Estimating next period's demand by observing the recent jump (average of last 3 periods is ~2030, but P22 spiked to 2218), I will set mu_hat to 2350. This accounts for (1+L) periods (where L=0, so 1 period) and builds in a buffer for the observed growth trend. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to accommodate the increased volatility seen in recent periods (standard deviation of last 5 periods is approx 150).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 22 demand reached 2218, maintaining a 4-period average of 2018. The growth trend remains aggressive, with demand increasing by roughly 100-150 units every 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2350.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a significant upward growth regime, consistently hitting record highs. Period 23 demand reached 2,449 units, continuing a trend where demand has increased by approximately 100-200 units per period over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 1986, 1875, 1995, 2218, 2449). Historical stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods indicate that standard historical averages are under-forecasting latent demand. With a lead time consistently at 0, the target inventory must cover the current period's expected high-side demand. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 2,650 to account for the ~200 unit jump seen in P23 and the continuing linear trend. Sigma_hat is set to 250 using 'explicit' to provide a safety buffer against the increased volatility observed in this high-growth phase. Since lead time is confirmed as 0, L=0 is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 23, reaching 2449 units. The 3-period moving average (P21-P23) has shifted to 2221 units, up from the P18-P20 average of 1885 units. Stockouts persist, suggesting latent demand is likely exceeding 2500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2270.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. In Period 24, demand reached 2,460 units, essentially plateauing near the previous period's high of 2,449. The average demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) is approximately 2,280 units. However, the system has consistently suffered from stockouts (P19, P20, P22, P23) because reactive historical averages lag behind this rapid growth. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given Profit=1 and Holding=1, implying a critical ratio q=0.5 and a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, though the OR engine's cap adds safety), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,650. This value accounts for the current 3-period moving average plus a growth buffer to stay ahead of the confirmed trend. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility observed in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained with high volatility: Period 21-24 average is 2,280 units compared to P17-P20 average of 1,835 (+24%). Stockout frequency remains high (5/7 most recent periods), indicating latent demand may still exceed supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1968.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volume, high-volatility regime. While the extreme linear growth seen in earlier periods (P1-P15) has transitioned into a high-level plateau, demand remains significant, averaging 2,301 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). Period 24 demand was 2,460 and Period 25 was 2,309, following a peak of 2,449 in Period 23. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts, which have occurred in 5 of the last 10 periods due to demand often exceeding the available inventory 'cap', I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 5. This captures the most recent demand level (~2300 units) while acknowledging the high variance (std dev ~200+). Because L=0, the backend base stock target will effectively be mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, which should provide enough buffer to handle the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at high volume: P21-P25 average is 2,301 units, representing a stabilization after the explosive growth phase. Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a high-demand plateau with significant volatility. Period 26 demand (2427) returned to the higher end of the recent range after a dip in Period 25 (2309). We experienced a stockout in Period 26 because the order quantity (1946) plus inventory (341) was insufficient to meet the demand of 2427. Recent history (P23-P26) shows demand values of 2449, 2460, 2309, and 2427, indicating a stable but high regime with a mean of approximately 2411. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, the base stock must cover only the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilized high-volume regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects both the current mean (~2411) and the observed variance to prevent further stockouts in this competitive demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has plateaued at a high volume: Period 23-26 average demand is 2411 units, showing stabilization after the explosive growth phase but maintaining a high stockout risk.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volume plateau with periodic upward surges. Period 27 demand reached a new high of 2565 units, causing yet another stockout, following a stockout in Period 26. The 4-period moving average (P24-P27) is 2440 units, but because the system is repeatedly hitting stockouts, actual latent demand is likely closer to 2600 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent chronic lost sales in this regime, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand cluster, while 'sigma_hat' will also use N=4 to account for the heightened volatility seen in the last several periods. This ensures the base-stock level is high enough to cover the realized demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a high-volume plateau with frequent stockouts (P26, P27). Latent demand is estimated to be ~2600 units based on recent growth and stockout levels. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2441.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exceed expectations, with Period 28 recording a new high of 2,733 units, resulting in another stockout. The observed lead time remains 0. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has been 2309, 2427, 2565, and 2733, showing a clear re-acceleration of the growth trend (averaging ~140 units of growth per period). Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 would only yield ~2508, which is already below last period's demand. To capture the persistent growth and account for latent demand evidenced by back-to-back stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,900. This provides a buffer for the expected growth and the stockout risk. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the high volatility in this elevated demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-accelerated starting P26: Period 25-28 demands (2309, 2427, 2565, 2733) show a linear increase of ~140 units/period. Ongoing stockouts (P26-P28) confirm that reactive averages are insufficient and latent demand likely exceeds 2700 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-growth, high-volatility regime. Demand in Period 29 reached 2915 units, indicating that the upward trajectory noted in previous periods (increasing by ~140 units/period since P26) is sustained. The system has suffered four consecutive stockouts (P26-P29), confirming that historical averages are lagging significantly and latent demand is likely exceeding availability. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, but in a growth environment, the OR backend's lag requires more aggressive parameters. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the linear trend (+140 units/period from the P29 demand level) to project Period 30 demand at ~3050 units. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)*forecast = 3050. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the recent surge in volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated linearly from Period 26-29, averaging +140 units per period. Systematic stockouts for 4 consecutive periods (P26-P29) indicate demand is consistently outpacing supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2682.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Historical demand from Period 26 to Period 30 has been 2427, 2565, 2733, 2915, and 2866. Although Period 30 saw a slight pull-back (2866 vs 2915), the overall trajectory suggests that demand in Period 31 will likely exceed 3000 units. Systematic stockouts have occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods (P26-P29) because historical averages (even recent ones) lag behind the growth. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it at 3150. Given the linear growth of approximately 100-150 units per period over the mid-term, 3150 provides a buffer to fulfill latent demand and prevent further stockouts. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will keep sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current high-volatility regime correctly.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 26-30 demands (2427, 2565, 2733, 2915, 2866) show a prevailing upward trend averaging ~2700 units, but with recent peaks hitting 2900+. Stockout frequency remains significant (80% of last 5 periods P26-P30), implying latent demand is likely >3000 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, reaching 3,137 units in Period 31. Over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 2,843 units, with a clear linear growth trend visible since Period 26 (+140 units/period). Stockouts have occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods (P26-P29, P31), indicating that true latent demand likely exceeds 3,150 units. The lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further stockouts and stay ahead of the confirmed growth trend, amu_hat of 3,300 is set via the explicit method. This accounts for the current 3,137 high plus an anticipated growth increment. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (roughly 7.5% of mu) to handle the observed volatility in this high-growth regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated linearly from Period 26-31, with P31 reaching a new peak of 3,137. Total demand has increased over 23x since P1. Stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods suggest latent demand is >3,200 units. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2494.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term aggressive growth trend, although the most recent period (P32) saw a slight dip to 2897 from the peak of 3137 in P31. Despite this fluctuation, the 5-period average (P28-P32) stands at 2909.6 units, while the 3-period average (P30-P32) is 2966 units. Frequent stockouts in recent history (P26-P29) suggest that actual latent demand often hits the replenishment cap. To account for the continued upward trajectory while acknowledging the recent volatility, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the average demand of nearly 3000 over the last few periods and the consistent pattern of +100 to +150 unit growth per regime shift, I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period to 3300 to ensure sufficient stock for potential new peaks. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 300 to handle the increased variance observed in the late-game growth phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained but volatile at high volumes; the average demand for P28-P32 is 2910 units. While P32 saw a dip, the trajectory from P26 onwards averages an increase of approx 100 units every 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3300.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive, approximately linear growth trend combined with significant periodic volatility. Period 33 demand reached 3,332 units, surpassing the previous record and resulting in a stockout. Historical lead time is consistently 0. Since Period_26, demand has grown from ~2400 to over 3300. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) average ~3029 units, but the high stockout frequency suggests latent demand is significantly higher, likely around 3400-3500 units. To prevent further stockouts and stay ahead of the confirmed growth regime, I am using 'explicit' methods. I set mu_hat to 3500 (representing (1+L) * forecast) to account for latent demand and trend, and \u03c3\u0302 to 350 to capture the increasing variance seen at these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 33 reached a new peak of 3,332 units. The 5-period average (P29-P33) is 3,029 units. Sustained stockouts in 8 of the last 10 periods (P24-P33) indicate that historical averages consistently underestimate true demand, which is currently trending towards 3,500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2926.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, although showing some variance. Period 34 demand was 3213, following a peak of 3332. The average for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 3089 units. Given the sustained growth and frequent stockouts (P33 saw a stockout where supply 3300 was less than demand 3332), it is necessary to use a forward-looking forecast. The current trend suggests demand is operating in a regime above 3300 units. Lead time is consistently 0. To ensure the OR engine targets a high service level that accounts for the observed latent demand and the linear-like growth, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3500 (balancing the recent peak and the ongoing trend) and sigma_hat to 250 to manage the increasing volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P33 peak of 3332 followed by P34 demand of 3213. 5-period average (P30-P34) is 3089 units. Sustained stockouts (e.g., P33) indicate latent demand frequently exceeds available inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3480.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to demonstrate a strong upward linear trend. Most recently, Period 35 demand reached 3,490 units. Over the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 3,214 units, showing a steady climb from the previous regime. Stockouts remain a frequent issue (e.g., P33), occurring whenever demand spikes above the starting on-hand inventory, which confirms that historical averages are still lagging behind true latent demand. Since lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by all previous 'conclude' messages), I am setting L to 0. To capture the recent acceleration and mitigate the stockout risk, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 3,700, which anticipates a further period-over-period increase of approximately 200 units. sigma_hat is also set via 'explicit' to 300 to provide a robust buffer against recent volatility seen in the P32-P35 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and approximately linear: Period 31-35 demands (3137, 2897, 3332, 3213, 3490) show a sustained upward trajectory with an average of 3,214 units. Frequent stockouts suggest current demand is consistently testing or exceeding 3,500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3700.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, reaching a new peak of 3,748 in Period 36, which resulted in a another stockout (starting inventory of 3,700 was fully sold). The demand growth is roughly linear, increasing by approximately 100-150 units every 1-2 periods. Historical averages and even recent_N windows frequently lag behind this aggressive growth, as evidenced by the high stockout frequency. Total demand has shifted from ~3,100 (P31) to ~3,750 (P36) in just 5 periods. To prevent further lost sales and account for latent demand that likely exceeds 3,800, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 3,950 for the next period (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period). This value accounts for the current trend and adds a buffer for the observed volatility. Actual Lead Time remains confirmed at 0 based on recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and linear: Period 32-36 demands show a sustained upward trajectory (2897, 3332, 3213, 3490, 3748). Stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P33, P34, P36) confirm that true demand is consistently outpacing supply and is currently trending toward 4,000 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong linear growth pattern, reaching 3,643 in Period 37. Over the last five periods (P33-P37), the average demand is 3,485 units, but more significantly, the trend is increasing by approximately 150-200 units every 2 periods. Stockouts occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods (P33, P34, P36), indicating that the base-stock policy is still trailing the actual latent demand. Given the current trajectory, I expect Period 38 demand to approach or exceed 4,000 units. To account for this growth and mitigate stockout risk while maintaining the single-period lead time logic (L=0), I am setting mu_hat to 4,100 units explicitly. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to cover the recent volatility around this trend. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Period 33-37 average is 3,485 units. The linear growth trend remains dominant, currently targeting a demand level of ~4,000 units. Stockouts in 60% of the last 5 periods confirm that reactive historical averages are insufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2642.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive, approximately linear growth regime from Period 1 through Period 36, followed by a slight stabilization/alternation in the most recent periods (P37 demand 3643, P38 demand 3371). Despite the recent two-period dip, the 5-period average (P34-P38) is 3493 units. Given the history of frequent stockouts (80% of periods P26-P36), it is critical to keep the base stock level ahead of the latent demand trend, which has consistently tested levels between 3500-4000 units. Actual lead time is consistently 0. To ensure high service levels while respecting the recent slight deceleration, I will shift to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-volume regime (~3500 level) without over-reacting to the very latest dip, nor being dragged down by older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth reached a high-volume plateau/regime around 3400-3700 units (P34-P38 average: 3493) following a sustained linear growth phase. Periodic volatility has increased, but the trend has stabilized after 35 periods of growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3493.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 39 was 3792, exceeding the available on-hand inventory of 3493, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has averaged 3608 units (3490, 3748, 3643, 3371, 3792). While the extreme linear growth phase seen earlier has transitioned into a high-volume plateau, the persistent stockouts (P36, P39) and high volatility suggest that demand frequently tests the 3800-4000 unit range. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, but because we are seeing frequent stockouts and linear trends often resume, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to 3850 to ensure we capture the upper end of the current regime's volatility and prevent further lost sales during this Period 40 decision.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volume plateau regime: P35-P39 average is 3608 units. Frequent stockouts (P36, P39) indicate that demand regularly exceeds 3700 units despite the slowing of the previous linear growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3850.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new high-volume plateau but continues to exhibit growth-oriented volatility, as evidenced by the Period 40 demand of 4106 units, our highest recorded to date. The 5-period average (P36-P40) is currently 3732 units, while the most recent 3-period average (P38-P40) is 3756 units. However, we have experienced two stockouts in the last two periods (P39, P40), indicating that the true demand is consistently exceeding our inventory supply. This confirms the 'latent demand' theory from carry-over insights. To prevent further stockouts and capture this latent demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 4250, which targets the upper end of recent demand spikes plus a small buffer for the ongoing upward trend. I am setting sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this current high-volume regime. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new peak of 4106 units in Period 40. Recurring stockouts in P39 and P40 confirm that latent demand currently exceeds 4000 units, even as the previous linear growth phase transitions into a high-volatility plateau.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its high-volume growth/plateau phase, with Period 41 demand reaching 4110 units, following a peak of 4106 in Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 3804 units, while the most recent two periods are consistently above 4100. Despite the 'explicit' order of 4250 in P41, the system ended with only 140 units on-hand, indicating that demand is very close to or slightly exceeding supply. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0. To prevent stockouts in this aggressive growth regime, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 4400 (reflecting a slight buffer over the recent 4100+ trend) and using a 'recent_N' of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility. L remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau has shifted upward again: P40-P41 demand averaged 4108 units, compared to the P35-P39 average of 3608 units (+14%).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent observed demand reaching 4421 in Period 42. Recent observations confirm that demand hasn't just plateaued but has shifted into a higher-volume regime where Period 42 demand is roughly 25% higher than the Period 34-38 average (~3500). Frequent stockouts (8 of the last 10 periods) reveal that historical averages are consistently trailing the actual demand, indicating significant latent demand. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, targeting 4600 units (representing current demand 4421 + a growth buffer) to stay ahead of the trend and mitigate persistent stockouts. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. sigma_hat is also set via 'explicit' to 300 to account for recent high-regime volatility and the risk of demand spikes reaching 4800-4900 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P40-P42 average (4212) is 17% higher than P35-P39 average (3608). The linear growth trend has re-accelerated, with demand reaching a new peak of 4421 in P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3492.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trajectory with occasional high-volume volatility. Period 42 saw a peak of 4,421 units, while Period 43 pulled back slightly to 4,046 units. The 3-period average (P41-P43) is 4,192 units, and the 5-period average (P39-P43) is 4,103 units. Given the consistent history of stockouts (P36, P39, P40, P42) whenever demand spikes, and the clear trend of latent demand exceeding supply, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4,700 to account for potential growth and ensure sufficient safety stock. This value is approximately 10-12% above the recent 3-period average, which aligns with the historical growth increments observed. Actual lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility without being overly influenced by the much lower variance in the early game.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P40-P43 average (4171) is significantly higher than the P35-P39 average (3608). The product continues to face frequent stockouts (P42, P40, P39), indicating that true market demand likely exceeds 4,500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4076.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trajectory. Period 44 demand was 4,388 units, following a regime shift where the average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) reached 4,214 units. We observed frequent stockouts in recent periods (P39, P40, P42) highlighting that demand often exceeds current inventory levels. The trend appears to be moving towards a target of 4,700-4,800 units. To account for this growth while maintaining a 50% service level (as profit = holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility at these higher volumes. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods, so L is set to 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P40-P44 average demand is 4,214 units, a 17% increase over the P35-P39 average. Periodic stockouts (P42, P40, P39) confirm that latent demand currently exceeds 4,500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4215.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive growth, with Period 45 demand reaching 4407 units. The 3-period moving average (P43-P45) is 4280 units, and the 5-period average (P41-P45) is 4274 units, confirming a sustained shift above the 4000-unit mark. Stockouts occurred in P42 and P45, indicating that latent demand likely exceeds 4500 units. To account for this growth and the high volatility observed in recent periods (where demand jumps by hundreds of units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4700 to provide a safety buffer and prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased variance of this high-volume regime. Lead time is confirmed as 0, which allows for same-period replenishment, but the policy must still target a base stock high enough to satisfy the demand that occurs immediately after the order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P41-P45 average is 4274 units (+18% vs P35-P39). Sustained stockouts (P42, P45) confirm latent demand exceeds 4500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4232.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term growth trend, although it has transitioned into a high-volume, high-volatility regime. Period 46 demand was 4466. Examining the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46), demand values were 4421, 4046, 4388, 4407, and 4466, resulting in a mean of 4345.6 units. Given the frequent stockouts observed throughout the game (e.g., P45, P42, P40), latent demand likely sits higher than these realized values. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To stay ahead of potential shifts and cover the significant intra-period volatility while minimizing stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4600 units (slightly above the recent average to account for the persistent growth bias). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this current high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: P42-P46 average demand has reached ~4345 units, showing a continued upward trajectory from the P35-P39 average of 3608 units. Frequent stockouts continue to suggest that latent demand is higher than realized sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4336.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a high-volume, high-volatility plateau. The recent demand history (P43-P47: 4046, 4388, 4407, 4466, 4468) indicates a stabilization around a mean of approximately 4400 units, moving away from the preceding steeper linear growth. Period 47 conclude shows an ending inventory of 132 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the primary goal is to set a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the slower historical data. This maintains a responsive but stable target of ~4400 units plus a safety buffer to mitigate the risk of stockouts seen in P45.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4400 units (P43-P47 average: 4355). Linear growth trend has transitioned into a high-volatility plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4355.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak of 4,822 units in Period 48, continuing the long-term aggressive growth pattern. The 5-period average (P44-P48) has risen to 4,510 units, up from the previous regime average. A stockout occurred in Period 48 because the starting inventory (4,355) was insufficient for the actual demand. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To capture the recent acceleration and the likely latent demand currently exceeding 4,800 units, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat (averaging P46-P48: 4,585 per period) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. Since lead time is 0, the backend will calculate the base stock targeting (1+0) * mean demand, set to stay ahead of the next demand realization.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth reached a new high-volatility peak of 4,822 in P48. The 5-period average (P44-P48) has shifted to 4,510 units (+4% from the previous 5-period average). Frequent stockouts (P45, P48) confirm that current demand is consistently testing the 4,800+ unit mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4586.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trajectory, reaching a new peak of 5,048 in Period 49. This represents a sustained regime shift from the ~4,400 unit plateau observed between Periods 43-47. The last context shows 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit arriving in Period 50 decision phase (as the Period 49 order arrived during Period 49's resolution). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the consistent stockouts (P48, P49) and a growth rate of roughly 200 units per period over the last two observations, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 5,300 to account for current demand plus the projected trend and latent demand. Sigma_hat is set to 350 to capture the high volatility seen in recent peaks. This proactive adjustment is necessary because historical averages (even recent_N) are lagging significantly behind this late-stage growth surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 49, reaching 5,048 units. The 3-period average (P47-P49) has shifted to 4,779 units. Systematic stockouts in P48 and P49 indicate that realized demand is capped by available supply and true latent demand is likely exceeding 5,200 units.
