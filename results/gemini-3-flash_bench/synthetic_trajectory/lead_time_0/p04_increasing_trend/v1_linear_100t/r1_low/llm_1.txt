Given that the promised lead time is 0, orders placed now arrive in the same period to meet demand. I need to cover Period 1's demand. Since I have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period plus a buffer for the observed growth. Although the historical data provided is for 'Period 1-5', I am currently tasked with deciding for Period 1 of the simulation. I will treat the historical average and trend as my guide. I'll target approximately 550 units to satisfy the high demand seen at the end of the historical sample, while considering that holding costs and profits are equal ($1.0), which penalizes overstocking as much as stockouts.",

With on-hand inventory at 293 and no in-transit units (since L=0), I need to place an order that covers the expected demand for Period 46 plus a safety stock buffer to mitigate recent volatility (peak of 4,421). I will target a total availability of approximately 4,700 units (the average of recent starting inventories which have prevented stockouts) to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs as the game approaches its conclusion in Period 50.",

To meet an expected demand of approximately 4,500 units with a small safety buffer (targeting ~4,700 total availability), I will order 4,466 units.

Specifically, Period 48 demand was 4,822 (leading to a stockout) and Period 49 demand reached 5,048 (also leading to a stockout). Since the current period (50) is the final period of the game, I must place an order that satisfies the expected demand for this period immediately, as the lead time is confirmed at 0. Given the recent growth rate and stockouts, I forecast Period 50 demand to be approximately 5,200 - 5,400 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units from previous periods (due to lead time 0), the order placed now will be the only inventory available to satisfy this final period's demand.
