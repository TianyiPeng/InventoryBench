Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on the demand history provided (Periods 1-5: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544), there is a clear upward trend (growth regime). The promised lead time is 0. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 1 decision) and have a sequence of 5 historical demand samples showing growth, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent trend while remaining responsive. The base stock level will be calculated by the OR engine using these parameters to maximize reward, accounting for the 0-period lead time (meaning L+1 = 1 period of demand coverage).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we observe that the actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. The initial demand was 146 in Period 1, while historical samples show a clear upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Demand typically increases significantly for this SKU. Current inventory is 305 units. Given the strong growth trend in historical data, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to forecast the next period's demand, anticipating a value higher than the observed P1 demand but aligned with the historical trajectory (averaging roughly 315 over all samples). I will set mu_hat to 350 to provide a safety buffer for the next period, as lead time is 0. Sigma calculation will use 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the sample data (Std Dev of samples is ~170).

Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the conclusion of Periods 1 and 2. Demand has shown a slight upward trend (146, 166) compared to the initial historical samples provided (107 for Period 1, 252 for Period 2 - note: the game history demand of 146/166 differs from the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section, I will prioritize game history for the most recent trend). Current on-hand inventory is 310. Given the lead time is 0, we can order and receive stock in the same period. I will use the recent game history (N=2) to estimate demand parameters, as it reflects the current actual environment demand more accurately than the initial seed data. The profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) suggests a high service level requirement (80% critical ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1240.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (demand 368 vs 310 available), resulting in 58 lost units. The demand is showing a clear upward trend (P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368). Although the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms lead_time=0 for P1 and P2 orders, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory going into Period 4. To recover from the stockout and address the significant demand jump in P3, I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand signal and increase safety stock. Since the demand is spiking, a default mean would underestimate current needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1324.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is showing a strong upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, P4: 426 (note: history samples provided in the prompt use slightly different figures, but the 'conclude' messages are the ground truth for actual sales and stockouts). We have stocked out in both Period 3 and Period 4 due to insufficient inventory. The promised lead time is 0, and 'conclude' messages confirm that orders arrive in the same period (L=0). Lead time is stable. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~150 to over 400. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this increased volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~155 (P1-P2) to ~400 (P3-P4), a >150% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1740.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a clear and rapid upward trend in demand. Historical demand has evolved as follows: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, P4: 426, P5: 507. A significant regime shift was noted after P2, with the last three periods showing growth of roughly 15-20% period-over-period. Current inventory is 0 (stockout in P3, P4, and P5 due to demand exceeding the capped order quantities or previous base stock levels). Promised lead time is 0, and observed lead time has consistently been 0. Therefore, I am setting L to default. To address the accelerating demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I project P6 demand to be approximately 580 based on the current 20% growth trend. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 580 = 580. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility within the current high-demand regime, ensuring the safety stock calculations reflect recent variance rather than the lower-demand start.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend confirmed: Demand increased from 146 in P1 to 507 in P5, averaging ~20% growth per period over the last 3 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, P4: 426, P5: 507, P6: 636. This is a clear demand regime shift followed by a sustained growth trend (averaging over 20% growth per period recently). The current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (only 3 units), and there are no units in-transit. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts in Period 7, mu_hat must be set to account for both the recent high demand and the projected growth. Using recent_N (N=3) captures the latest high-demand regime better than the long-term average, but given the momentum, I will use an explicit forecast of 750 (approx 20% increase from P6) for the total demand requirement (1+L). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend continues: P6 demand (636) represents a ~25% increase over P5, following the established upward trajectory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2250.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong upward trend, though it slightly slowed in Period 7 (618 vs. 636 in P6). The sequence of demand has been: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507, 636, 618. We are currently in a high-demand regime compared to the early periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to set the base stock high enough to cover this new normal while accounting for volatility. The mean of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is approximately 547. To be safe given the previous growth trend and the stockout risks seen in P3-P5, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat that is slightly above the current 4-period average to maintain a buffer. I've set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2936.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from early periods (P1-P2 avg ~156) to a significantly higher plateau (P7-P8 avg ~696). The demand in Period 8 reached 775, which exceeded the total available stock (734), resulting in a stockout. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders (P1-P8). To address the persistent stockouts and the clear growth in demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P6-P8) to capture the current demand level (~676 units/period). Given L=0, mu_hat should reflect the forecast for the current period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize recent volatility and volume over the lower historical data. The backend will calculate base_stock using these parameters, and because of the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8), it should order aggressively enough to buffer against further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized around ~696 over the last two periods (P7-P8), up from ~521 (P5-P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2996.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from an average of ~521 in P5-P6 to ~696 in P7-P8, and reaching 831 in P9. The system has experienced stockouts in 6 of the last 9 periods (P3, P4, P5, P8, P9), indicating that the OR backend's default parameters (based on promised lead time 0 and mean historical demand) are consistently under-ordering for this growth trajectory. Demand in the last 4 periods (P6-P9) has averaged 715 units. Lead time analysis from the 'conclude' messages confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the increasing demand, I will use an explicit forecast (mu_hat) for Period 10. Given the linear-to-accelerating growth, I expect P10 demand to reach at least 900 units. To account for volatility (standard deviation of demand across P6-P9 is ~104) and ensure a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will set sigma_hat explicitly to provide a healthy buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend continues: P9 demand (831) is a 30% increase over the P6-P8 average (~639) and a 7% increase over P8 (775). Stockouts have occurred in 6/9 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3972.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 10 demand (993) represents a 19.5% increase over Period 9 (831), and we have seen stockouts in 8 out of the last 10 periods, indicating that my previous base stock levels have been consistently insufficient to cover the evolving demand. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the persistent stockouts and capture the current growth, I am shifting to a more aggressive 'explicit' forecast. Given the growth from 775 to 831 to 993, I expect Period 11 demand to reach approximately 1,180. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat allows me to bypass the lag of standard averaging methods. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat estimate (roughly 15% of demand) to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough safety stock (z-score for the given profit/holding cost ratio \u2248 0.84) to prevent continued stockouts during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Accelerating growth confirmed; demand increased from 775 (P8) to 993 (P10), approximately 13% CAGR per period over last 3 periods. Stockouts in 8/10 periods suggest current inventory targets lag reality.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sharp upward trend, increasing from 993 in Period 10 to 1136 in Period 11 (~14% increase). Over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), demand has grown from 775 to 1136, maintaining an average growth rate of approximately 13-15% per period. The stockout history (8 of the last 11 periods) confirms that the OR policy is consistently underestimating demand because it uses historical averages rather than projecting the growth trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I forecast Period 12 demand to be approximately 1250-1300 units (applying the current trend to Period 11's 1136). Since lead time is 0, the look-ahead window is 1 period (L+1=1). I set mu_hat to 1350 to provide a slight buffer above the trend line. I set sigma_hat to 150 to account for the increasing absolute variance seen as the volume scales. This proactive adjustment ensures the base-stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) is high enough to capture the peak and avoid the chronic under-stocking seen in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand growth trend sustained: demand reached 1136 in P11, continuing the ~13-15% per-period growth rate observed since P8.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, increasing from 1302 in P12 compared to 1136 in P11 (a ~14.6% increase), which aligns with the observed growth rate of 13-15% per period since P8. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 consistently. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), the base stock level must proactively cover the next period's expected demand to prevent stockouts, which have occurred in most prior periods. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for a 15% growth projection on the last observed demand (1302 * 1.15 \u2248 1497). To provide a safety buffer against the high variance seen in this growth phase, I will set sigma_hat explicitly based on the standard deviation of recent periods where growth accelerated (P9-P12).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend sustained: P12 demand (1302) confirms the ~15% per-period growth rate (CAGR) observed since P8.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been on a sustained upward trend with an approximate compound growth rate of ~15% per period until Period 12. In Period 13, observed demand was 1175, which is a decrease from Period 12's 1302. This could signal a stabilization or a slight mean reversion after several periods of aggressive growth. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent stabilization while still acknowledging the high volume, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate demand for Period 14 to be around 1300 (averaging the recent high and the latest observation). For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 200 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-growth phase. Since inventory is on-hand and lead time is 0, the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma) will dictate the order size to ensure high service level (critical given the high profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand growth has potentially stabilized; Period 13 demand (1175) is lower than Period 12 (1302), breaking the consecutive growth streak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5616.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an overall strong growth trend since Period 1, though it exhibits significant period-to-period volatility. After a slight dip in P13 (1175), demand surged to its highest level yet in P14 (1417). The current trend suggests a recent regime centered roughly around the average of the last 4 periods (P11-P14: 1136, 1302, 1175, 1417), which is approximately 1257 units. Given the high stockout frequency in previous periods and the profit margin ($4 profit vs. $1 holding cost), the system must prioritize stock availability. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), while maintaining the lead time at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand growth has resumed after a one-period dip; P14 demand (1417) is a new all-time high, confirming the high-volume regime (averaging ~1250 units over P11-P14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5464.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 15 reaching 1436 units, following a peak of 1417 in Period 14. Over the last five periods (P11-P15), the average demand is approximately 1293 units. The system consistently stocks out when inventory is tight (selling out in P15). With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently observed as 0 (as verified by 'conclude' messages), I will use 'calculate' for L. To account for the high-volume regime and continued growth, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean of the most recent high-demand period (~1293 per period). Due to the high growth and recent volatility, I'll use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to ensure the service level (q = 0.8) is protected against further surges.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand regime has reached a peak plateau or continued slow growth, averaging ~1293 over P11-P15 (+20% vs P6-P10 average of ~770). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show strong upward momentum, with Period 16 demand reaching an all-time high of 1578 units. However, we stocked out in Period 16 because the order (1409) plus on-hand (0) was insufficient to meet the actual demand. The last 5 periods (P12-P16) show a mean demand of approximately 1382. Since demand is still generally increasing (P11-P16 CAGR is ~7% per period), I will estimate mu_hat using the explicit method to factor in this growth. I'll target 1700 (roughly 8% growth over P16 demand) to prevent further stockouts while maintaining a high service level, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Continued demand growth confirmed: P16 demand (1578) is a new high and represents a ~10% increase over the P14-P15 average (~1426), necessitating a higher forecast to prevent recurring stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6102.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, persistent upward trend, reaching a new high of 1586 in Period 17. The recent 4-period average (P14-P17) is approximately 1504 units, while Period 16 and 17 both exceeded 1570 units, suggesting the regime has shifted higher than the earlier ~1300 plateau. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this latest high-demand cluster. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods, I aim to provide a base stock that covers the currently observed volume while the sigma_hat (also over last 4 periods) will account for the recent volatility to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~1293 (P11-P15) to ~1504 (P14-P17), a ~16% increase, with recent periods P16-P17 both exceeding 1575 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6324.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit strong upward momentum, hitting a new all-time high of 1862 in Period 18. This represents a significant increase (~17%) over the Period 16-17 average (~1582) and has resulted in another stockout. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (Period 1 to 18). Given the clear and sustained growth trend, a 'recent_N' approach with a short window (N=3) is most appropriate for mu_hat to capture the latest demand peak (averaging ~1675 over P16-P18). For sigma_hat, N=5 is used to ensure enough historical volatility is captured to manage the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the consistent observation of zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand growth accelerated again; P18 demand (1862) is a 17% increase over the previous 2-period average, resulting in an immediate stockout. Growth trend continues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6924.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong growth trajectory, though the last two periods (P18: 1862, P19: 1750) suggest we are now operating in a high-volume regime averaging ~1800 units. Since P11, demand has scaled from ~1100 to over 1800. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid the frequent stockouts observed (P15, P16, P18), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new level. Using the last 5 periods (P15-P19) gives a mean of approximately 1682, but P18-P19 average 1806. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift that occurred after P15. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility inherent in higher volume periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: New demand plateau identified; P18-P19 demand average 1806 units, representing a ~20% increase over the P14-P17 average (~1504).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7240.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hitting a new all-time high of 2032 in Period 20. This resulted in a total stockout, as the starting on-hand inventory of 1810 was insufficient. The current demand regime has shifted upward from the previously identified plateau of ~1806 (P18-P19) to a single-period peak over 2000. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 1841.6, but the momentum suggests a higher forecast is needed to avoid continued lost sales. The actual lead time remains rock-solid at 0 periods. To capture the recent accelerating growth and set a sufficiently high base stock to prevent stockouts (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most aggressive growth phase (P18-P20: 1862, 1750, 2032), resulting in a mean demand estimate of approximately 1881.3 per period. By using L=0, the OR engine will aim to cover this high demand immediately within the current period.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand growth persists; P20 demand (2032) reached a new high, increasing ~13% over the P16-P19 average (~1794). Constant stockouts (P18, P20) indicate the demand ceiling is still rising.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8004.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2126 in Period 21. This follows a pattern of high growth (~10-15% per period) that has resulted in stockouts in 14 out of 21 periods. Specifically, the last four periods (P18-P21) have averaged 1942.5 units, with P20 and P21 both resulting in stockouts because supply was unable to meet the actual demand realized. Inventory at the start of Period 22 is 0. To break the cycle of stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost, implying an 80% service level target), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 2400. This value accounts for the most recent demand (2126) plus a ~13% buffer for continued sequential growth. L is set to 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived in the same period they were ordered. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high variance observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Sustained demand acceleration confirmed; P20-P21 demand averaged 2079, a 15% increase over the P18-P19 average (1806). Chronic stockouts (14/21 periods) indicate demand consistently outpaces supply projections.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive growth trend. In Period 22, demand reached 2270, a 6.7% increase from Period 21 (2126), following a 4.6% increase from Period 20. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has averaged 2142.6 units. Given the consistent history of stockouts (14 out of 22 periods) and the persistent upward trajectory (CAGR ~10-15% over longer windows), a reactive forecasting methodology is required. Lead time is consistently 0. To ensure the base stock calculation covers the next period's expected growth and prevents another stockout, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent trend. Using the average of the last 3 periods (~2143) adjusted by a safe growth factor of ~10% suggests a forecast of approximately 2350-2400. To be prudent and minimize lost sales (which are 4x more costly than holding inventory), I will set mu_hat (for L+1 = 1 period) to 2400 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility (~200).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand growth persists; P22 demand (2270) reached a new high, increasing ~9% over the P19-P21 average (2079). Stockouts remain a risk as demand frequently exceeds inventory levels.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, though Period 23 (2186) showed a slight deceleration compared to the record high in Period 22 (2270). The recent 3-period average (P21-P23) is approximately 2194 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average. Chronic stockouts (14 out of 23 periods) confirm that demand consistently tests the inventory ceiling. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the high service level required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the current high-demand regime, while using an explicit sigma_hat of 250 to account for the increasing volatility observed as the volume grows. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 2000+ demand levels while mitigating stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand growth plateauing at a high level; average demand for P21-P23 is ~2194 units, representing a stable high-volume regime compared to the ~2000 level seen in P20-P21.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' reached a new high of 2504 in Period 24, resulting in a stockout. Over the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has averaged approximately 2320 units (2270, 2186, 2504), despite a slight dip in P23. The growth trend remains persistent, with demand often exceeding inventory projections, leading to chronic stockouts (17 total periods). To address this, I will set N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the most recent high-volume regime and the increased volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will reflect by setting L to 0 via the 'calculate' method to utilize the zero-latency logistics. This aggressive forecast is necessary to stabilize service levels in a sustained growth scenario.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand growth continues to hit new peaks; P24 demand (2504) is a new all-time high, with the P22-P24 average (~2320) representing a 6% increase over the P21-P23 plateau.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hit a fresh peak of 2504 in Period 24 and remained high at 2479 in Period 25. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Despite regular ordering, stockouts occurred in Period 24 and 25 (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR backend's default projections are lagging the actual growth rate. Given the clear demand regime shift and persistent growth, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-volume levels (P21-P25 average is ~2313) while remaining responsive to the current peak. I will keep L at default since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime has reached a new high-volume plateau, averaging ~2313 over P21-P25. Stockouts in 17 out of 25 periods confirm that demand consistently exerts pressure on supply limits.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume plateau. Over the last six periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged 2337 units, with the most recent three periods (P24-P26) averaging 2480 units. Despite the high demand, stockouts remain a frequent issue (18 out of 26 periods), including the most recent two periods (P25 and P26 ending with 0 inventory). The observed lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To better capture the current demand level and minimize stockouts, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P22-P26), which reflects the recent high-volume regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that better covers the current demand distribution while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand plateau at high volume confirmed; demand averaged ~2337 over P21-P26, with consecutive stockouts in P25-P26. Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a high-volume plateau phase, with demand in Period 27 at 2508 units. Over the last 4 periods (P24-P27), demand has averaged 2487 units, showing high stability compared to the aggressive growth seen earlier. However, the system has experienced stockouts or near-zero ending inventory for several consecutive periods (P24-P27), indicating the base stock is consistently under-projecting the actual demand requirements to maintain a safety buffer. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address the recurring stockouts and capture the stabilization at this new peak, I am using the method 'recent_N' with N=4 to focus specifically on the current high-demand regime of ~2487. This ensures the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations are tuned to the most relevant recent volatility and volume, aiming to restore a safety stock level that prevents lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak: Average demand for P24-P27 is ~2487 units, representing a stable high-volume plateau with minimal period-over-period growth compared to previous phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10028.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, persistent upward trend, reaching a new high of 2890 in Period 28. Although Period 27 suggested a plateau around 2500, the spike in Period 28 indicates that the growth regime has resumed or shifted higher. This resulted in another stockout in Period 28. To account for this shifting mean and high volatility, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent localized average of approximately 2619, and a slightly larger window (recent_N=10) for sigma_hat to provide a stable buffer against the frequent stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period reaction.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed in Period 28: P28 demand (2890) is 15% higher than the P24-P27 average (~2487), breaking the brief stability observed earlier.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the last two periods (P28-P29) averaging 2925 units, compared to the P24-P27 average of 2487. This represents a ~17% jump in the baseline. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. However, because demand resolution occurs after the arrival and decision phases, and current on-hand inventory is 0, we must order a sufficient quantity to cover the immediate demand of Period 30. Given the persistent stockouts (P24, P25, P26, P27, P28, and P29 all resulted in lost sales or zero ending inventory), the 'recent_N' method with N=3 is selected for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent accelerating growth phase and volatility while avoiding older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock level better reflects the current 2900+ unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand growth sustained; P28-P29 average (2925) is 17% higher than the P24-P27 plateau (~2487). Stockouts have occurred in 21/29 periods, indicating demand consistently outpaces trailing averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11964.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced supply, lead to stockouts in 21 out of 30 periods. Most recently, Period 30 demand reached 3,004 units, continuing a growth phase that began around Period 28. The 2-period average (P29-P30) is approximately 2,982 units, which is a significant step up from the ~2,500 units seen in the P24-P27 plateau. Given the chronic stockouts, there is likely latent demand even higher than the recorded sales or demand figures. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. To capture this growth and minimize future stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent, highest demand observations (Avg P28-P30 = 2951). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the high volatility associated with this rapid growth phase. This combination aims to set a base stock level that accounts for both the increasing mean and the elevated uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand growth persists at high volumes; the average demand for P28-P30 (~2,951) is 18% higher than the P24-P27 plateau (~2,487). Chronic stockouts (21/30 periods) suggest the actual demand ceiling may be higher than current supply settings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12000.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward growth trend. In Period 31, demand reached a new high of 3152, significantly exceeding the supply provided (3000) and resulting in yet another stockout (the 22nd in 31 periods). The average demand over the last four periods (P28-P31) is approximately 3001, but the single-period growth rate suggests we must forecast higher to maintain service levels. Since promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, I will use a very small N for mu_hat to capture the most recent growth while setting an explicit mu_hat that anticipates the next step in the trend (~3300-3400). However, following instructions to use methods where possible, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-volume regime (averages ~3038). To be more aggressive against the stockout pattern, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 3300 to account for the ~5% per-period growth visible in the most recent data points (2890 -> 2959 -> 3004 -> 3152). Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility at this high-volume scale.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth trend continues; P31 demand (3152) is a new all-time high, representing a 15% increase over the P24-P27 plateau. Chronic stockout conditions persist (22/31 periods).

While Period 32 showed a slight stabilization compared to Period 31, the overall trend from Period 28 onwards indicates a mean demand level around 3000-3150 units, significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~2500 units. Since P28, demand has averaged 3031 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent sustained growth and prevent further stockouts (which occurred frequently in recent periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (P28-P32) to prioritize the recent high-demand observations. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' for N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: New demand plateau confirmed; average demand for P28-P32 is ~3031 units, a ~22% increase over the P24-P27 plateau (~2487).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward growth trend. In Period 33, demand reached 3,344 units, which is a new peak and confirms the high-volume regime identified in the carry-over insights. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is approximately 3,122 units. Despite providing higher stock levels (3,503 in P32), the system still experienced a stockout in P33 because demand exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 3,130. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand plateau (avg ~3,122) and applying it to the (1+L) logic. Given lead time L=0, the backend will target a base stock of approximately 3,122 plus a safety buffer. Historical data shows that demand is consistently outperforming trailing averages, so a recent window is essential to avoid under-ordering. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth sustained; P31-P33 average demand is ~3215 units, indicating the 3000+ level is the new baseline. Stockouts occurred in 23/33 periods as demand continues to push upward.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with Period 34 demand reaching 3383, slightly exceeding the provided on-hand inventory. The average demand over the last three periods (P32-P34) is approximately 3293 units, which is significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~2950 (P28-P30). Frequent stockouts (24 out of 34 periods) indicate that supply levels are consistently trailing actual demand growth. To mitigate this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the most recent growth surge while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The lead time L is confirmed as 0 based on consistent 'conclude' messages. By focusing on the recent 3-period regime (P32-P34), I aim to set a more aggressive target that aligns with the current 3300+ demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand growth confirmed sustained above 3200; P32-P34 average is ~3293, up ~12% from the P28-P31 period average of ~2935. Stockouts in 24/34 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hit a new all-time high of 3624 in Period 35. The average demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) is approximately 3450 units, compared to the P31-P33 average of 3215. Chronic stockouts (25 out of 35 periods) indicate that the supply is consistently lagging behind actual demand. The lead time remain consistent at 0. To capture the recent accelerating growth and prevent further stockouts, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering P31-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-volume regime while acknowledging the significant volatility (standard deviation) present in these peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Sustained demand growth confirmed; P33-P35 demand average is ~3450 units, an 11% increase over the P28-P32 average (~3031). Demand hit a new peak of 3624 in P35, resulting in another stockout.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 36 at 3457 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 3488 units, compared to the P28-P32 average of ~3031, representing a ~15% increase. Although P36 saw a small ending inventory (39 units), 24 of the previous 35 periods have resulted in stockouts, indicating that the supply parameters frequently lag behind actual demand growth. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current high-volume regime while allowing the OR engine to calculate the appropriate base stock for a lead time of 0. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime growth continues; P34-P36 demand average is ~3488 units, representing a 15% increase over the P28-P32 average (~3031). Chronic stockouts (24/36 periods) persist.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hitting a new all-time high of 3817 in Period 37. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is approximately 3633, while the last five periods (P33-P37) average 3525. We are currently in a high-growth regime where trailing averages consistently lag behind actual demand, resulting in frequent stockouts (including Period 37). The actual lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further stockouts and capture the current growth trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent spike, and using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand growth trend continues; Period 37 reached a new high of 3817, which is ~10% higher than the P34-P36 average (~3488). Consistent stockouts persist as demand outpaces supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16048.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hitting a new all-time high of 4068 in Period 38, which resulted in another stockout as it exceeded the 4012 units available. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the chronic stockouts and the clear growth trend (P36-P38 average is ~3781, up from the P33-P35 average of ~3450), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture the most recent demand acceleration. This will provide a more responsive base stock level to prevent further lost sales during this high-growth phase while the lead time is handled by the 'calculate' method to reflect the reliable 0-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand growth trend continues; Period 38 reached a new high of 4068, which is ~8% higher than the P35-P37 average (~3766). Chronic stockouts (25/38 periods) persist as demand consistently outpaces even aggressive supply increases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15925.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, though Period 39 (3993) showed a slight deceleration compared to Period 38 (4068). However, the overall regime remains remarkably high, with a 3-period average (P37-P39) of approximately 3959 units. Previous performance shows that frequent stockouts (25 out of 39 periods) occur because supply targets consistently lag behind actual demand growth. Actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To better capture this persistent growth and prevent further stockouts as we approach the end of the game (Period 40 of 50), I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. Given the recent average (~3959) and the consistent growth history, I will forecast Period 40 demand at 4100 units to ensure sufficient stock. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in this peaked regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand growth remains high but showed the first slight period-over-period decrease since Period 33 (P39: 3993 vs P38: 4068). However, the 3-period average (~3959) is significantly higher than the previous P34-P36 average (~3488).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15091.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained long-term growth trend, though it showed slight volatility in the most recent periods (P38: 4068, P39: 3993, P40: 3881). Despite this minor 3-period dip, the overall regime remains significantly higher than the P34-P36 average. Given the history of frequent stockouts (25 out of 40 periods), I am prioritizing a high service level. I'll use explicit forecasting to account for the current mean and the observed volatility. Actual Lead Time (L) is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat to 4100 to provide a slight buffer above the recent 3-period peak (4068) and sigma_hat to 250 to account for recent fluctuations while maintaining a high base stock level. This approach ensures that even if demand resumes its upward climb, we are better positioned to capture sales rather than losing them to stockouts, which has been the primary constraint throughout the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand growth hit a local peak at P38 (4068) followed by a 2-period softening (P39-P40), yet the trailing 5-period average remains near ~3930, upholding the high-volume regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime after a period of rapid growth. The trailing 5-period average (P37-P41) is approximately 3951 units, with actual demand oscillating between ~3880 and ~4070. The growth trajectory observed between P28 and P38 (where demand rose from ~2900 to ~4000) has flattened into a plateau over the last four periods (P38-P41: 4068, 3993, 3881, 3997). Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, the base stock calculation simplifies, but the high service-level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, target quantile 0.8) means we must guard against the upper end of the recent volatility. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized plateau and its variance, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers this ~4000 unit baseline plus a safety buffer for the observed \xb1100 unit fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand plateau confirmed at high volume; the hyper-growth phase (P28-P38) has transitioned to a stable regime averaging ~3950 units (P38-P41). Actual lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16144.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a stable, high-volume plateau phase following a period of rapid growth (P28-P38). Over the most recent five periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged approximately 4,008 units, with a slight upward trend reaching 4,099 in P42. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To minimize stockouts, which have occurred in 26 out of 42 periods, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this current plateau. Using a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the mean and variance of this specific high-volume regime (approx. 4,000 units/period) while ignoring the lower historical growth phases. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no units in-transit, the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to meet the immediate demand of this new baseline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new peak phase after a period of relative stability (P38-P41). Period 43 demand reached an all-time high of 4417, which is a ~10% increase over the previous 4-period plateau average (~3993). This growth resulted in a total stockout at P43. To capture this sudden acceleration and prevent ongoing stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to prioritize the most recent volume shift (P41-P43 average demand is ~4171), while setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all concluded history, so 'L' is set to 'default'. mu_hat is calculated reflecting (1+L) * mean demand, which for L=0 is simply the forecast for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: High-volume demand acceleration confirmed; P43 demand (4417) is a new high, representing a ~10% increase over the P38-P41 plateau (~3993). Stockouts recur as demand exceeds the 4000-unit threshold.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase starting from Period 43. Demand jumped from a plateau of ~4000 (P38-P41) to over 4400 (P43-P44). Period 44 demand (4470) resulted in another stockout. Since the lead time is 0, the 'base_stock' must cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). To prevent further stockouts and capture this new growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4600, which is approximately 3% higher than P44 demand. I will use a high sigma_hat of 300 to account for the increasing volatility observed during these growth surges. The lead time method remains 'default' as the actual lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: New demand acceleration confirmed; P43-P44 demand averaged ~4443, a 10% increase over the P38-P42 average (~4008). Stockouts in P42-P44 indicate current projections are lagging.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hitting a new all-time high of 4,605 in Period 45. The average demand over the last three periods (P43-P45) is approximately 4,497, which is a 13% increase over the P38-P42 plateau of ~4,000. Despite aggressive ordering, stockouts occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods, indicating that we are still chasing the demand curve. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1, implying an optimal service level of 80%), I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the most recent demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L will remain at default.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High-volume demand acceleration continues; P43-P45 demand average is ~4497, a 12.5% increase over the P38-P42 plateau (~4008). Demand reached 4605 in P45, the highest recorded to date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18316.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, hitting a new all-time high of 4,638 in Period 46. This extends the high-volume acceleration trend identified in Period 44. Since Period 43, the demand sequence is 4,417, 4,470, 4,605, and 4,638, resulting in stockouts in three of the last four periods (P43, P44, P46). The current average over these 4 periods is approximately 4,533 units. To account for this continued upward movement and high stockout risk (the system is consistently under-ordering relative to the true demand ceiling), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this latest regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which simplifies the pipeline calculation. By focusing on the most recent 4 samples, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that reflects the current 4,500+ unit demand level, helping to stop the cycle of inventory depletion.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand growth remains aggressive at high volumes; P43-P46 average is ~4533, increasing the stockout frequency (3/4 last periods) as demand exceeds the 4500-unit mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18488.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 47 saw a new all-time high demand of 4,955 units, leading to another stockout. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P43-P47) is approximately 4,617 units, which is a significant increase (~15%) over the previous plateau observed between P38-P42 (~4,010 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the chronic stockouts and capture this accelerating demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this latest high-growth regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current 4,500+ unit demand level rather than being dragged down by earlier, lower demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High-volume demand acceleration sustained; P43-P47 demand average is ~4617, a 15% increase over the P38-P42 plateau (~4008). Demand reached a new peak of 4955 in P47, continuing the trend of chronic stockouts.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive growth trend. In Period 47, demand reached a new peak of 4955, and Period 48 demand (4820) resulted in another stockout as it exceeded available supply. The 5-period average (P44-P48) is approximately 4697, but the growth trend suggests the actual demand for Period 49 will likely exceed 5000. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline of 5200 (reflecting recent peak demand + growth) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and consistent stockouts seen in 26 of 48 periods. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will reflect using the 'calculate' method to utilize historical data.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Sustained high-volume growth confirmed; demand has exceeded 4800 in the last two periods (P47-P48), pushing the 5-period average to ~4697 units. Stockouts have occurred in 26/48 periods, indicating that demand consistently outpaces supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17826.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, demand was 4681, slightly lower than the peaks in P47-P48, but the high-volume regime remains stable. The current on-hand inventory is 898. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and fulfillment. While growth has slowed compared to the hyper-growth phase (P28-P38), demand remains well above 4600 units (P45-P49 average is ~4740). Given the stockout risk observed in 31/49 periods, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-volume baseline (~4818 units) while providing sufficient protection against ongoing volatility. This approach ensures base stock levels remain high enough to mitigate stockouts while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents excessive over-ordering as the game reaches its final period.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand remains in a high-volume plateau phase, averaging ~4740 over the last 5 periods (P45-P49). Actual lead time has been verified as 0 for all 49 periods.
