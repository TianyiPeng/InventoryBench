The OR recommendation of 117 seems to be calculating a base stock based on low initial variance and recent history, but with a current on-hand of 305 and demand trending sharply upwards (most recent sample was 544), there is a risk of a stockout if we only order 117.

Since on-hand (339) already exceeds this, the uncapped OR recommendation would be 0. The provided recommendation of 60 likely uses the higher historical sample mean (avg ~317). 5.

Period 45 recorded a new peak demand of 4,605 units, following a trend of 4,111, 4,417, 4,470, and 4,605 over the last four periods. The 3-period moving average is now 4,497 units. The OR baseline (3,255) is severely under-forecasting because it includes early-game low-demand data. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I need to order enough to satisfy Period 46's expected demand. Given the clear upward trend, I anticipate Period 46 demand could reach 4,600-4,800 units.

The OR algorithm's recommendation of 3,336 units is significantly lower than the current demand reality because it likely incorporates the very low demand figures from early in the game (Periods 1-15), which are no longer relevant. With a promised and observed lead time of 0 periods, the order arrives within the same period to satisfy that period's demand. Since Period 50 is the final period, I need to ensure Period 49's demand is fully met while considering that I only have 180 units on hand. To cover a forecast of approximately 4,900 to 5,000 units for Period 49 and minimize stockouts, I will order 4,800 units.
