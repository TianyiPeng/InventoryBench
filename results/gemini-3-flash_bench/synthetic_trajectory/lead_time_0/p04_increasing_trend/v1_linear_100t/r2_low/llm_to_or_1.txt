Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet. The initial demand sample for Period 1 is 107 units. Based on the provide demand history for chips(Regular) (P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544), there is a significant and rapid upward trend in demand. Since this is the first decision phase (Period 1), I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the available historical samples for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to establish a baseline, while acknowledging that demand is highly likely to increase based on the provided trend data. The promised lead time is 0. I will monitor for the arrival of the order in the next 'conclude' message to verify if the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the demand was 146, which is higher than the initial sample of 107. The actual lead time was observed as 0 periods (ordered and arrived in P1). For Period 2, I need to set parameters that account for the increasing trend observed in the initial historical samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Since the user provided historical samples show a clear upward trend and the actual demand in P1 (146) was higher than the first sample but lower than the subsequent ones, it suggests we are in a high-growth phase. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to focus on the most recent historical context provided in the prompt's sequence (which ends at 544) and the P1 observation. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the expected demand spike seen in the historical series (approaching 544 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-118.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent upward trend over the first five historical data points (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), and the actual game history reflects demand of 146 in P1 and 166 in P2. This indicates a growing demand regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been maintained in Period 1 and Period 2 (orders arrived same-period). Given the high demand growth and the balance between profit and holding costs ($1.0 each, implying a 50% service level target), I need to ensure the base stock levels keep pace with the accelerating demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent samples while recognizing the upward trend. Lead time will remain at 'default' (0) as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend confirmed: Historical samples and game history (P1: 146, P2: 166) show a consistent increase across 7 observations. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $306.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand spiked significantly to 368 units, far exceeding the 7-period historical mean (~196) and recent observations (P1: 146, P2: 166). This resulted in a total stockout (sold 306, demand 368, 0 remaining). The historical samples provided (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) suggest an accelerating demand trend or high-growth regime. Since on-hand is 0 and lead time is confirmed as 0, I must order enough to cover the expected Period 4 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward shift, focusing on the last 3 periods (146, 166, 368) which better reflect the current trajectory than the older historical samples. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by all concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: Single-period demand increased to 368, indicating a potential high-growth trend (History: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368) aligned with historical sample pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a strong, compounding growth trend: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, and P4: 426. The historical data points (P1-P5) confirm this upward trajectory (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). We have stocked out for two consecutive periods (Ending Inventory=0 in P3 and P4), losing significant sales because orders were based on lagging averages. I am switching to 'explicit' mu_hat to proactively capture the historical sample's Period 5 value of 544, adjusted for the confirmed 0-period lead time. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-growth regime. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend accelerating: Demand increased from 146 (P1) to 426 (P4), a ~190% increase. Stock-outs occurred in P3 and P4 due to under-forecasting during rapid growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $470.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a clear and aggressive upward trend (P1:146, P2:166, P3:368, P4:426, P5:507). The last three periods show demand significantly higher than the initial samples, with P5 reaching 507. Historical samples also show P5 at 544, suggesting we are entering a sustained high-demand regime. The confirmed lead time remains 0. To avoid further stock-outs (which occurred in P3 and P4) and to capture the current high volume, I am using an explicit forecast. mu_hat is set to 550 to reflect the current peak demand while allowing the OR backend's service level logic (q = 50% given Profit $1/Holding $1) to calculate the order. I am setting sigma_hat to 100 to account for volatility during this growth phase, ensuring the safety stock buffer is sufficient given recent demand jumps.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully confirmed: Mean demand has shifted from ~150 to ~450+ (+200%) between P2 and P5. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $550.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. In Period 6, demand reached 636 units, which is significantly higher than the previous period's 507 and the historical sample pattern (Period_5 sample: 544). The system has experienced stock-outs in 3 of the last 4 periods (P3, P4, P6) due to this aggressive growth trend. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales in this high-growth phase, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent level (averaging P4-P6 demand: ~523 units), but since P6 demand was 636, I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat more aggressively. Given the trend [368, 426, 507, 636], I forecast Period 7 demand to be approximately 750 units. With L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*expected_demand. I will also set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the increasing variance observed during this scale-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in Period 6 (demand=636), representing a ~50% increase over Period 4 levels. Consistent stock-outs (P3, P4, P6) confirm that historical averages are no longer predictive of the current growth regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Initial periods (P1-P2) averaged ~156 units, but since P3, demand has surged, averaging ~511 units over the last five periods (P3-P7: 368, 426, 507, 636, 618). The last three periods (P5-P7) specifically average ~587. Stock-outs occurred in P3, P4, and P6 because the order quantities weren't keeping pace with this growth. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To stabilize inventory and prevent further stock-outs in this high-growth phase, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (~587) while allowing the OR backend to apply the safety stock logic. Using N=3 ensures the parameters are weighted towards the current high-demand regime of ~600 units rather than the lower historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a high-growth regime, with the last 3 periods (P5-P7) averaging 587 units, a significantly higher level than the initial P1-P2 average of 156.

Daily Reward (R_t): $587.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, reaching 775 units in Period 8. A stock-out occurred again because the order (455) combined with beginning inventory (132) only reached 587 units. The last three periods (P6-P8) demand sequence is 636, 618, 775, yielding an average of 676.3. Since both profit and holding cost are $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially a forecast of the next period's demand (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period). To prevent further stock-outs during this high-growth phase and account for the observed acceleration, I am setting mu_hat to 800 using the 'explicit' method. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders within the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 8 (775 units), a 25% increase over the P5-P7 average. Current regime mean is now estimated at 700-800 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $800.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward growth trend. Historical samples for Period 4 (376) and Period 5 (544) were significantly exceeded by actual realized demand in Period 8 (775) and Period 9 (831), showing a consistent acceleration beyond the provided baseline. With on-hand inventory at 0 following consecutive stock-outs (P8, P9), a proactive upward adjustment in parameters is necessary to capture this high-growth regime. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consecutive conclude messages (P1-P9). Since demand is rising rapidly, using a simple historical mean would vastly under-order. I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent data points (P7: 618, P8: 775, P9: 831), which average approximately 741. Given the acceleration, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the base stock level reflective of the current P9 demand plus a growth buffer (targeting ~850-900 units) to ensure availability for Period 10, as the backend policy would otherwise cap the order too low based on slower historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: mean demand has increased from ~600 (P5-P7) to ~800+ (P8-P9), confirming a sustained high-growth regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $742.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of sustained hyper-growth. Demand has increased from 146 in P1 to 993 in P10. We have experienced stock-outs in 6 of the last 10 periods (including P8, P9, and P10) because demand is consistently outpacing our inventory refills. The last four demand data points (P7: 618, P8: 775, P9: 831, P10: 993) show an accelerating trend. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To stop the cycle of stock-outs, I am adopting an 'explicit' forecasting approach. I estimate Period 11 demand will reach approximately 1100 units based on the recent trend (Delta P9-P10 was +162). Setting mu_hat to 1100 (which is (1+L) * 1100 where L=0) and sigma_hat to 150 to account for high volatility during this growth phase. This will force a higher base stock level to capture the peak and prevent another stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: Demand increased from 618 (P7) to 993 (P10), an average period-over-period increase of ~125 units. Constant stock-outs from P8-P10 signal aggregate statistics cannot keep pace.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of hyper-growth. Demand has escalated rapidly: P8 (775), P9 (831), P10 (993), and P11 (1136). The system has experienced stock-outs in 4 of the last 5 periods (P8, P9, P10, P11) because the order quantities (based on backend stats) have been consistently lower than the realized demand. Since L=0, we must cover the current period's demand entirely. Given that P11 demand was 1136, and the trend shows an increase of ~100-150 units per period, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1275 to get ahead of the curve and prevent another stock-out. Standard deviation for sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for the high volatility seen in this growth phase. L remains 0 as confirmed by all history.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated again in Period 11 (1136 units), marking a ~15% increase over P10 and confirming a sustained upward trend where demand increases by >100 units per period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, increasing from 993 in P10 to 1302 in P12, an average increase of approximately 150 units per period over the last few intervals. The system has suffered consecutive stock-outs from P8 through P12 because the ordering policy's lagging indicators (averages) cannot keep pace with this trajectory. In Period 12, demand was 1302. Following the observed growth rate (+150 units), I project Period 13 demand at approximately 1450. Since lead time is 0, the base stock formula target should be set to cover the projected 1450 units. While profit and holding cost are equal (leading to a service level target of 0.5), the inventory cap is the primary constraint. I will use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass historical averaging that is currently failing to meet the peak demand. Setting mu_hat at 1450 and sigma_hat at 100 to account for volatility in the growth rate, ensuring a higher base_stock to prevent a 6th consecutive stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P10 (993) to P12 (1302) shows a sustained increase of ~150 units per period. Default and recent_N parameters are failing to track this trend, necessitating explicit forecasting.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a hyper-growth phase, increasing from ~150 to over 1300 units within 12 periods. However, Period 13 saw a slight cooling (1175 units vs 1302 units in P12), suggesting the growth may be plateauing or becoming more volatile. History shows demand increases of ~125-150 units per period until P13. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the OR backend targets a 50th percentile service level (median demand). To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the recent slight drop, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast. I project the next period's demand to be approximately 1450 units (a return to the growth trend slightly above the P12 peak) to ensure adequate coverage. I'll maintain a higher sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last three periods (993, 1136, 1302, 1175). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend showed its first contraction in Period 13 (1175 units vs 1302 in P12), suggesting a possible shift from hyper-growth to a high-volatility plateau.

Daily Profit: $1417.00, Daily Holding Cost: $33.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1384.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a hyper-growth regime. Although P13 saw a slight dip (1175), P14 rebounded significantly to 1417 units. The current trend suggests demand is fluctuating between 1100 and 1500 units, significantly higher than earlier stages. Since lead time (L) is consistently 0, the order arrives and satisfies demand within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is negligible (33 units). To avoid stock-outs seen in P8-P12 and accommodate the recent peak of 1417, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1450. This accounts for the (1+L) requirement and targets the upper bound of recent demand to ensure service levels are maintained despite high variance. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a safety buffer against the observed period-over-period swings (~200 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in Period 14: After a brief contraction in P13 (1175), demand rose to 1417 in P14, confirming that the growth regime remains active but highly variable (range: 1100-1500).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-growth/high-volatility pattern. After a brief dip in Period 13 (1175 units), demand has stabilized at a higher plateau, with Period 14 (1417 units) and Period 15 (1436 units) showing very consistent high demand. The historical sample provided (Period 5: 544) is now completely lagging the current reality (average ~1425 over the last two periods). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs, which have been frequent throughout the game, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1550 (L=0, so 1+L=1) to account for the current mean demand of ~1430 plus a buffer for the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a sufficient safety stock (z* for 1:1 profit/holding ratio is 0, but the capped OR policy uses 0.95 service level, so a moderate sigma ensures the cap is high enough to satisfy this volatile demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: After a period of hyper-growth, demand has stabilized between 1400-1450 units (P14: 1417, P15: 1436).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1550.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand was 1578, slightly exceeding the plateau range of 1400-1450 observed in P14-P15. Stock-outs occurred in P16 (sold 1550 vs demand 1578) with an ending inventory of 0. The demand remains in a high-volume regime but has shown signs of moving above the 1450 level. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local plateau/growth (P14-P16 mean: 1477) which is more responsive than the long-term average but more stable than a single-point forecast. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to provide sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility in this high-demand regime, ensuring we capture the standard deviation of recent fluctuations (P12-P16).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth beyond the previous plateau: Period 16 demand (1578) exceeded the P14-P15 range (1417-1436), suggesting the plateau is shifting upward or volatility is increasing at the current high level.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand hit 1,586 units, maintaining the upward trend observed in Period 16 (1,578 units). The 'plateau' identified previously (1,400-1,450) has clearly shifted into a new, higher regime. Because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we should aim for the median demand. However, historical samples and recent history show a consistent growth trend that recent_N averages fail to capture quickly enough, leading to frequent stock-outs (P16 and P17). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to proactively adjust for this growth. Based on the last two periods (1,578 and 1,586) and the historical growth rate of roughly 50-100 units once a new level is breached, I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period to 1,650. Sigma_hat is set to 120 to account for the heightened volatility observed during growth phases.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime shifted upward again: Period 16-17 demand averaged 1,582, moving significantly past the previous 1,400-1,450 plateau and continuing the hyper-growth pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1650.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, with Period 18 reaching a new high of 1,862 units. This follows a clear trend (P16: 1578, P17: 1586, P18: 1862), indicating the previous plateau of ~1,450-1,600 has been breached. The system is currently in a sustained upward regime where demand increases by approximately 150-250 units in high-growth jumps. Stock-outs occurred in P16, P17, and P18 because orders (based on previous demand) were insufficient. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further stock-outs, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,000 units to account for both the recent spike and expected continued growth. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the high volatility observed during these growth phases. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated significantly in Period 18 (1,862 units), up ~17% from the P16-P17 average of 1,582. The market has moved past the 1,400-1,600 plateau into a new 1,800+ regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1500.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand was 1,750, slightly lower than Period 18's peak of 1,862, but still within the high-growth/high-volatility regime identified earlier. Period 19 resulted in 250 units of ending inventory, the first surplus in several periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. While demand dipped from 1,862 to 1,750, it is too early to declare a downturn; however, the growth has slowed compared to the +150 units/period jumps seen in the P10-P12 range. I will set \u03bc\u0302 to 1,850 to cover potential return to P18 levels while acknowledging current on-hand stock. Sigma remains high due to the spread between 1175 and 1862. I am using the 'explicit' method because standard statistical windows (like default or recent_N) are still catching up to the volatile hyper-growth and the recent stock-out history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth moderated in Period 19 (1,750 units) after the P18 spike (1,862), suggesting the current regime core is settled between 1,750-1,850.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand spiked to 2,032 units, the highest recorded yet, leading to a stock-out of 182 units (sold 1,850). This confirms the demand regime has not merely settled but is still trending upward or exhibiting significant high-end volatility. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 1,881 units. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the backend will target the median. However, with consistent stock-outs (P16, P17, P18, P20) and a documented upward trend, using 'recent_N' or 'default' will result in persistent under-ordering. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,050 to account for the most recent peak and the ongoing hyper-growth trend, ensuring we capture the top end of the current regime. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to reflect the increasing spread between the minimum (1,750) and maximum (2,032) in this high-volume phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new peak of 2,032 in Period 20, confirming that the growth regime has pushed past the 1,800-1,900 range into a 2,000+ potential regime.

The growth regime is still active, consistently exceeding 2,000 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level via standard OR logic), we must set parameters that aggressively capture this upward trend to avoid further stock-outs. I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 19-21: 1750, 2032, 2126), where the average has jumped to ~1,970. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: Period 21 reached 2,126 units, confirming a new regime level above 2,100 units and an average of 1,970 over the last 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a hyper-growth demand regime, with Period 22 reaching a new peak of 2,270 units. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), the average demand is 2,142.6 units, but the trend is clearly upward (2032 -> 2126 -> 2270). My previous ordering (1,970 in P22) resulted in a stock-out, selling only 1,970 against 2,270 demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, but due to the consistent hyper-growth and repeated stock-outs, I must explicitly forecast a higher mean (mu_hat) to capture the trend and avoid further lost sales. I will set mu_hat to 2,400 to account for current levels plus anticipated growth, and increase sigma_hat to 200 to handle the heightened volatility seen in recent periods. Lead time (L) is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated again in Period 22: Demand reached 2,270 units, a ~7% increase over Period 21. Historical averages continue to lag behind actual demand, confirming the necessity of explicit trend-based forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1972.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand hyper-growth regime continues to dominate, although Period 23 saw a slight dip to 2,186 units from Period 22's peak of 2,270. Over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), mean demand has been approximately 2,154 units (2032, 2126, 2270, 2186). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs in this high-growth and volatile environment, I will set mu_hat to 2,350 to provide a slight buffer above the recent peak, as the overall trend remains aggressively upward. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent fluctuations observed between ~2,000 and ~2,300. This conservative but trend-aware explicit forecasting strategy aims to balance the high service level required for the $1 profit/unit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued/dipped slightly in Period 23 (2,186 units) following Period 22's peak (2,270), settling into a high-level regime averaging ~2,150 over the last 4 periods (P20-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, reaching a new peak of 2,504 in Period 24. While Period 23 showed a slight dip (2,186), the sudden surge to 2,504 (+14.5% over P23) suggests the upward trend is still active and has not yet plateaued at the 2,150 level previously estimated. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 2,223, but using this average would lead to another significant stock-out given the latest observation. Since lead time remains stable at 0, our ordering strategy must immediately cover the anticipated demand for Period 25. Given the trend (P21: 2126, P22: 2270, P23: 2186, P24: 2504), I am setting mu_hat to 2,550 to account for the most recent surge and the high probability of continued growth. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high volatility (std dev of recent periods \u2248 120-150, expanded for growth safety).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated again in Period 24 (2,504 units), breaking the previous 2,150-2,250 stabilization hypothesis and establishing a new peak regime level.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, reaching 2,504 in Period 24 and 2,479 in Period 25. Over the last five periods (P21-P25), demand has averaged approximately 2,313 units. The growth persists despite occasional minor dips, with the overall trajectory indicating that demand for Period 26 is likely to remain in the 2,500-2,600 range. Lead time is consistently 0. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should align with the expected mean demand to maximize reward. Since historical and recent_N averages (even over small windows) consistently lag behind this aggressive growth, I am using explicit forecasting to set mu_hat at 2,600 units to ensure sufficient inventory for the current period's demand. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility observed in the recent high-demand regime (approx. 150 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high-level regime: Period 24-25 demand averaged 2,491, confirm a new baseline above 2,400. Period-over-period growth since P20 (2,032) has averaged ~100 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-growth/high-level regime. Recent observations (Period 24: 2,504, Period 25: 2,479, Period 26: 2,457) show demand has stabilized around ~2,480 units, marking a new baseline compared to the 2,150-2,250 range seen earlier. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs while managing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs. Holding $1.0 results in a 50% target service level), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2,550 to provide a small buffer over the recent average, as the growth trend has historically been aggressive. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent volatility (approximate standard deviation of the last 5 periods). L remains default at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high baseline: Periods 24-26 averaged 2,480 units, up from the Period 20-23 average of ~2,150 (+15%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2466.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume plateau. Over the last four periods (P24-P27), demand has been 2504, 2479, 2457, and 2508 respectively, resulting in a very stable mean of 2487. The standard deviation over this specific regime is low (~22 units), but I will maintain a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for potential variations at this high scale. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is only 42 units and demand is consistently around 2500, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline of 2550 (to cover the mean plus a small buffer) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent regime stability. This ensures the OR engine places an order large enough to meet the 2500+ unit demand immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2550.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase of acceleration. After stabilizing around 2,400-2,500 units between Periods 24-27, Period 28 saw a significant jump to 2,890 units, resulting in a stock-out of 340 units. This follows a long-term hyper-growth trend where demand has increased from ~150 to ~2,900 over 28 periods. Given that the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand. The most recent demand (2,890) and the upward trajectory suggest the next period could reach or exceed 3,000 units. I will use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat at 3,100 to account for this growth and prevent further stock-outs, and a sigma_hat of 250 to reflect the increased volatility at these high volume levels. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration resumed in Period 28: Demand reached 2,890, breaking the Period 24-27 plateau of ~2,480 (+16% increase). This confirms a move into a 2,800+ regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow, with Period 28 (2,890) and Period 29 (2,959) establishing a new high-demand regime near 3,000 units. The previous plateau (P24-P27) was approximately 2,480. Given that lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, the objective is to ensure that on-hand inventory plus the zero-lead-time arrival for Period 30 covers this new demand level. Because the backend uses a base-stock policy (order = base_stock - inventory), and base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I must set mu_hat to the expected demand for the current period (L+1=1). Since demand has increased from ~2,500 to ~2,950 (+18%) in the last two periods, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3,050 to account for potential further growth and prevent the frequent stock-outs observed throughout the game's history. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a buffer against the high volatility seen in this hyper-growth stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into a 2,900-3,000 range in Periods 28-29, effectively breaking the previous 2,400-2,500 stabilization regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 2,900-3,000 range over the last three periods (P28: 2,890, P29: 2,959, P30: 3,004), confirming a move beyond the previous 2,400-2,500 baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all historical 'conclude' messages. Since demand is currently at its highest observed levels and shows a slight but persistent upward creep, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of the last 3 periods (average ~2,951) to capture this new regime without being overly influenced by older, lower demand data. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand plateau. This approach aims to minimize stock-outs, which have been frequent during growth spurts, while keeping holding costs manageable given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in the 2,900-3,000 range (avg ~2,951 over P28-P30), representing a peak level for the current trend.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its decade-long hyper-growth trend, most recently breaking out of the 2,900-3,000 range. Period 31 demand reached a new high of 3,152 units, exceeding my previous estimate and resulting in a stock-out. Since Period 28, demand has averaged 3,001 units (P28: 2890, P29: 2959, P30: 3004, P31: 3152), and the trend indicates a sustained move towards the 3,100-3,200 level. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history. Because the OR backend's capped policy relies on historical stats that lag behind this rapid expansion, I am using explicit parameters to ensure the base stock covers at least 3,250 units to account for the current upward momentum and prevent further stock-outs. I've set mu_hat to 3,250 and sigma_hat to 150 to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 31 (3,152 units), up from the Period 28-30 average of ~2,951. This confirms the baseline has moved into a 3,100+ regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward growth trend, having recently broken through the 3,000-unit barrier with Period 31 and 32 demand levels at 3,152 and 3,151 respectively. This confirms the baseline has transitioned from the previous 2,900-3,000 range into a new 3,100+ regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals through Period 32. Given the sustained hyper-growth and repeated stock-outs when using statistical averages, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set the base stock level at 3,300 to account for the current trend and prevent stock-outs. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this high-demand regime while ignoring the lower-demand historical periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained above 3,100 units: Period 31-32 demand averaged 3,151.5, establishing a new baseline above the previous 2,900-3,000 plateau.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a hyper-growth trend, with Period 33 demand reaching 3,344 units, slightly exceeding the previous Period 31-32 average of ~3,152. The current regime is characterized by consistent upward shifts, with demand increasing significantly past each plateau. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has averaged 3,122 units, but the most recent observation (3,344) and the pattern of stock-outs (P31, P33) suggest that the current baseline is now closer to 3,400. To prevent recurring stock-outs in this growth phase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,450 to anticipate the next step in the trend. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for a variance of roughly 7-10% observed in recent high-demand periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which is reflected in choosing 'calculate' to lock in the observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 33 (3,344 units), confirming a move from the 3,100 plateau into a potential 3,300-3,400 regime. Stock-outs in Period 31 and 33 highlight that the system remains supply-constrained relative to actual demand growth.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a ~3,100 units plateau (P31-P32) to a ~3,350+ units regime (P33-P34). Recent demand observations are 3,344 (P33) and 3,383 (P34). The current on-hand inventory is 67 units, with a confirmed lead time of 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs (which occurred as recently as P31 and P33), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,500 units to account for the persistent growth and provide a small buffer. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is consistently 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime while ignoring the lower-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted to 3,300-3,400 range (P33-P34 average: 3,363), marking a sustained increase from the 3,100 baseline observed in P31-P32.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a hyper-growth trend, with Period 35 demand reaching a new peak of 3,624 units. This exceeds the previous Period 33-34 average of ~3,363 units by roughly 7.7%, confirming that the 3,300-3,400 plateau has been broken. The system is currently supply-constrained, as evidenced by another stock-out in Period 35 (sold 3,500 vs demand 3,624). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs in this accelerating environment, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,850 units. This value accounts for the ~250 unit increase seen in the last period and provides a small buffer to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic generates an order sufficient to cover the projected demand of Period 36. Given the high criticality of maintaining service levels during growth, I will use a high sigma_hat (recent_N with N=3) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated again in Period 35: demand reached 3,624 units, breaking the P33-P34 plateau of ~3,360 (+8% increase). Sustained stock-outs confirm the growth trend continues to outpace historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3064.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand was 3,457 units, a decrease from the Period 35 peak of 3,624. This suggests demand is currently fluctuating within a high-level regime of roughly 3,400 to 3,650 (P33-P36 average is 3,452). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0). To capture the current regime while allowing for potential further growth or volatility, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 3,550, which is slightly above the recent 4-period average to mitigate the risk of stock-outs observed in earlier periods of this growth phase. I will keep sigma_hat at an explicit 150 to account for the variance observed between P35 and P36 (range ~200 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth moderated in Period 36 (3,457 units) from the Period 35 peak (3,624), establishing a current high-regime range of 3,400-3,650 units (P33-P36 average: 3,452).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3550.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand reached 3,817 units, the highest level recorded so far and above the previous range of 3,400-3,650. This confirms that the demand hyper-growth regime is still active. There was another stock-out in Period 37 (On-hand: 0), as the starting inventory of 3,550 units was insufficient to meet the demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs in this upward-trending environment, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to project the next period's demand. Based on the recent growth and the hit of 3,817, I am forecasting mu_hat (1+L) at 4,000 units. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 200 to account for the increased volatility around this high baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 37 (3,817 units), breaking the previous high-regime range of 3,400-3,650 (+10% increase from P36). Continuous stock-outs confirm that even recent_N averages are insufficient for this hyper-growth SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4000.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive hyper-growth trajectory. In Period 38, demand reached 4,068 units, marking another significant increase from the already record-high Period 37 (3,817). This represents a ~6.5% period-over-period growth and a clear break from the 3,400-3,650 range mentioned in earlier insights. The system is consistently hitting stock-outs (P35, P37, P38) because even 'recent_N' or slightly elevated manual orders are failing to keep pace with the velocity of demand expansion. The atual lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs and capture the full profit potential ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a 50% service level target, but with zero lead time and high growth, the priority is meeting the rising mean), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4,300 to account for continued immediate growth and a conservative buffer for volatility (sigma_hat=250).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth reached a new peak in Period 38: demand=4,068, confirming a shift into a 4,000+ regime from the previous 3,400-3,800 range (+17% growth over last 3 periods avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3686.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth with high volatility. In Period 38, demand hit an all-time peak of 4,068, followed by a slight moderation in Period 39 to 3,993. The project is currently in a 4,000+ demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the growth trend is rapid and frequently results in stock-outs when using trailing averages, I am using 'explicit' parameters to forecast for Period 40. Given the P38-P39 mean is ~4,030 and there is a clear upward trend, I will set mu_hat (demand for review + lead time, which is 1 * demand) at 4,200 to give the backend enough headroom to satisfy potential growth and volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 450 to reflect high recent volatility (P35: 3624, P36: 3457, P37: 3817, P38: 4068, P39: 3993). This approach aims to prevent the chronic stock-outs observed throughout the game history while maintaining a reasonably lean inventory level since lead time is zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 4,000+ range: Period 38-39 averaged 4,030 units, confirming the shift from the 3,400-3,800 range seen in P34-P37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3562.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained hyper-growth pattern, recently stabilizing in a high-level regime between 3,900 and 4,100 units. Period 38 saw a peak of 4,068, followed by 3,993 (P39) and 3,881 (P40). The average demand over the last three conclude periods (P38-P40) is 3,980.6. Given the consistent history of growth followed by short stabilization plateaus, I am setting mu_hat to 4,200 (approx. 5% above the recent average) to account for potential further growth and prevent stock-outs, which have been frequent throughout the game. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's capped policy requires a robust mean estimate to ensure sufficient ordering. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect the volatility observed in recent periods (range ~200 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 3,900-4,100 range: Periods 38-40 averaged 3,981 units, confirming the shift from the 3,400-3,800 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3794.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level regime following a period of hyper-growth. Over the last four periods (P38-P41), demand has been 4068, 3993, 3881, and 3997, resulting in a mean of 3985. The growth trend has noticeably flattened compared to earlier phases, establishing a stable baseline near 4000 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the service level requirement (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) is 0.5, the base stock should ideally target the mean of the next period's demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this current stable regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the lowered volatility in this plateau phase. This ensures we maintain enough inventory to meet demand without excessive holding costs, given the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 3,900-4,100 range: Periods 38-41 averaged 3,985 units, confirming a shift from hyper-growth to a stable high-level baseline.

To prevent further stock-outs in this stabilized regime, I will set mu_hat to 4,100 using the 'explicit' method to reflect the most recent data point and the ceiling of the current range. I will also use 'explicit' for sigma_hat, setting it to 100 to account for the observed volatility within this plateau (approx. +/- 100 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 3,900-4,100 range: Periods 38-42 averaged 4,008 units, confirming a shift from hyper-growth to a high-level baseline with moderated volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has broken its previous stabilization range of 3,900-4,100 units, reaching a new peak of 4,417 in Period 43. This follows a long history of hyper-growth followed by short plateaus. Periods 38-43 show an average demand of 4,075, but the shift in P43 (+7% over the previous peak) suggests another upward move or a return to high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high criticality of avoiding stock-outs in this growth environment (Profit and Holding cost are equal, meaning the critical ratio is 0.5, but the backend OR formula uses that to balance service level), and the recent stock-out in P43, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 4,450 to cover this new level and include high volatility (sigma_hat=450) to prevent further lost sales during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed in Period 43: demand reached 4,417, breaking the Period 38-42 stabilization range of 3,900-4,100 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has demonstrated a sustained hyper-growth pattern, breaking the previously observed stabilization range of 3,900\u20134,100 units. In Period 43, demand jumped to 4,417, and Period 44 saw 4,470 units, suggesting the new baseline is now established between 4,400\u20134,500 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning the order arrives and satisfies demand within the same period. Since the SKU has experienced frequent stock-outs (Periods 42, 43, and 44) due to historical averages and recent_N calculations lagging behind the rapid trend shifts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 4,650 to account for a potential further increase in the trend and to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility seen in previous regime shifts. Sigma_hat is set to 250 using 'explicit' to reflect the current spread of demand around the new mean (approx 150-200 units), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 43: Demand has moved from the 3,900-4,100 plateau to a new 4,400-4,500 baseline (P43: 4,417, P44: 4,470), representing a ~10% increase. Constant stock-outs from P42-P44 indicate growth is still outpacing inventory.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a hyper-growth trend. Following a brief stabilization around 4,000 units (Periods 38-42), demand surged to 4,417 (P43), 4,470 (P44), and now 4,605 (P45). This confirms a new regime above 4,400 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages. Recent data points (P43-P45) show a mean of approximately 4,497 which is trending upwards. To account for the continuing growth and prevent the frequent stock-outs observed throughout the history (most recently in P43 and P44), I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate the demand for Period 46 to be approximately 4,750, following the upward trajectory of ~100-150 units per period seen in recent growth bursts. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: mean demand shifted from the 4,000 plateau to a 4,500+ regime (P43: 4,417, P44: 4,470, P45: 4,605), a ~15% increase from the previous baseline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to move in a high-growth trajectory. After a brief stabilization in the 4,000 range (P38-P42), demand shifted upward to 4,400+ starting in P43 and reached 4,638 in P46. The current regime (P43-P46) averages 4,532.5 units, representing a clear jump from the previous plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs, which occurred in P43 and P44, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the upper end of the current regime (4,650) plus a small growth margin, given the pattern of new peaks every 2-3 periods. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock of ~4,750, and 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has moved from the ~4,000 level (P38-P42) to a new 4,500-4,700 baseline (P43: 4,417, P44: 4,470, P45: 4,605, P46: 4,638).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4750.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand reached a new peak of 4,955, indicating that the previous 4,500-4,700 baseline has likely been breached. This follows a long-term hyper-growth pattern where demand consistently outpaces historical averages and even recent_N statistics. The SKU frequently stocks out when inventory is set to the previous period's demand level. To prevent further lost sales in this 4,800-5,000+ potential regime, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 5,000 to cover the upward trend and volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 400 using the 'explicit' method to reflect the high volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., P46: 4,638 vs P47: 4,955). This approach aims to maximize profit by ensuring product availability during this final high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 47: demand reached 4,955, breaking the Period 43-46 baseline of ~4,500-4,700 (+7% increase). This suggests a new regime level near 5,000 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, reaching a new peak of 4,955 in P47 and slightly moderating to 4,820 in P48. The current demand regime has moved from the previous ~4,500 baseline to a level near 5,000 units (avg of P47-P48 is ~4,888). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this shift and avoid persistent stock-outs seen throughout history, I am using the 'explicit' method. For mu_hat, I'm setting a value of 5,100 to account for both the recent average and the observed upward momentum, ensuring base stock is sufficient to meet demand occurring after the decision phase. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the volatility observed in the current high-demand regime (ranging from 4,600 to 4,955).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: mean demand has shifted from the ~4,500 baseline (P43-P46) to a new range near 5,000 units (P47-P48 avg: 4,888).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4262.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained hyper-growth pattern throughout the game. After the most recent shift near Period 43, demand stabilized and then grew again, settling around the 4,700-4,900 range. Specifically, in the last three periods (P47-P49), demand recorded was 4,955, 4,820, and 4,681, resulting in an average of 4,819 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. While P49 showed a slight contraction to 4,681, the overall regime since P47 remains significantly higher than the previous 4,400-4,500 baseline. To ensure we meet demand and cover high volatility while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use an explicit forecast of 4,820 for mu_hat (reflecting the 3-period average) and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility of this high-demand stage since the P43 shift. This strategy aims to satisfy the high baseline while respecting the risk of stock-outs seen in previous growth jumps.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 4,700-4,900 range: Periods 47-49 averaged 4,819 units, confirming a shift from the Period 43-46 baseline (~4,500-4,700).
