Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data and no inventory. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples provided are 107, 252, 298, 376, 544. There is a clear upward trend in demand over these initial sample points. To avoid Stockouts and respond to this growth, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the average of the provided samples (315.4) multiplied by (1+L) where L=0. I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat reflecting the high volatility (std dev is ~163). L is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the product 'chips(Regular)' exhibited an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 146 units, which is higher than the initial sample provided (107) but significantly lower than the subsequent historical samples provided (252, 298, 376, 544). This suggests a strong upward trend or growth phase in demand. Since we are at Period 2, I have only one period of actual game history, but the historical data provided in the prompt shows a clear accelerating trend. To react to this growth and avoid stockouts as demand scales toward the 500+ range seen in later samples, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a forecast that considers the next historical data point (Period 2: 252). Given L=0, the formula is (1+L) * forecast. I will forecast current period demand at approximately 250 units. For volatility (sigma), I will use the standard deviation of the available historical samples to ensure a reasonable safety buffer during this growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2806.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 146 and 166. In the pre-game history, demand showed a significant upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). However, the actual game play for P1 and P2 shows lower values (146, 166) compared to the late pre-game phases. This suggests a potential variance or a cooling off from the P5 peak of 544. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the chips category often sees high volatility and we have a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Given the discrepancy between pre-game samples (all samples mean \u2248 313) and recent game performance (mean = 156), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the transition from late pre-game to early game) to balance the high peak with current reality. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect this volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6785.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend over the first three periods (146, 166, 368), indicating a potential regime shift or strong growth. In Period 3, demand (368) was more than double the average of the first two periods. To capture this recent spike while maintaining some stability, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent in all concluded periods (P1-P3), so I will use the 'default' lead time setting. Choosing recent_N over the default mean ensures the OR engine prioritizes the recent higher demand volume in its base stock calculation to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8091.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is showing a strong upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, P4: 426 (note: history samples provided in intro differ slightly from conclude messages; I will prioritize the conclude message demand data). The mean of the last 2 periods is 397, while the mean of all 4 periods is 276.5. Given the clear growth, using a larger N would underestimate current demand. I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will use 'calculate' for L. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed as demand levels scaled up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased significantly starting Period 3 (Avg P1-P2: 156 vs Avg P3-P4: 397), representing a ~150% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9518.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong and sustained upward trend over the first five periods (146, 166, 368, 426, 507). This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified, with the average demand increasing significantly from the early periods. Period 5 demand reached 507 units. The inferred lead time from history is consistently 0 periods (orders placed in P1-P5 arrived in the same period). To capture this rapid growth while maintaining responsiveness, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to focus on the most recent, higher-demand periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 will reflect the increased volatility seen during this growth phase, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one nearly experienced at the end of Period 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 3-5 average demand is 434, a 2.7x increase over the Period 1-2 average of 156. Growth trend is currently sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10431.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, consistent upward trend over the last 6 periods: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507, 636. This indicates a clear demand regime shift. In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (sold 549 units with 0 ending inventory and 636 demand), indicating our previous base stock level was insufficient. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 523 units. Given the growth trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent high-demand regime. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in periods 1 through 6. I'll maintain L at 0 to focus ordering on meeting immediate demand. Using higher recent variance (N=3) for sigma_hat will help increase the safety stock buffer to prevent further stockouts in this climbing demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 4-6 average demand is 523, representing a 50% increase over Period 3 (368) and a significant acceleration from early periods. Stockout occurred in Period 6 due to 636 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11662.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift. Demand started at an average of 156 (P1-P2) and escalated to an average of 540 over the last three periods (P5-P7: 507, 636, 618). A stockout occurred in Period 6, and the ending inventory in Period 7 (80 units) remains low relative to this new demand level. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 historical observations. Given the sustained high demand and the growth trend, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 650 (approximate average of recent high demand + a small buffer for growth) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime, and L is set to its promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: Period 5-7 average demand is 587, confirming a sustained shift from the initial Period 1-4 average of 276. Observed lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14687.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, sustained upward trend since Period 3. Focusing on the most recent five periods (P4-P8), the demand samples are 426, 507, 636, 618, and 775. The average demand over these last five periods is 592.4, but the most recent two periods (618 and 775) suggest even higher growth. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level target is high (~95%), necessitating a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture the recent acceleration in demand while maintaining responsiveness, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (which averages the shift) and sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. The 'explicit' method for L is set to 0 to align with the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressively positive: Period 6-8 average demand is 676, a 14% increase over the Period 5-7 average (587) and significant growth from the Period 4-6 average (523).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15428.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Comparing the last three periods (P7-P9 average demand = 741) to the preceding three (P4-P6 average demand = 523) shows a 41% increase. Period 9 experienced a stockout (demand 831 vs 812 satisfied), which follows another stockout in Period 6. The current lead time (L) is consistently 0. Given the consistent acceleration and previous under-ordering resulting in stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the most recent high-demand regime, and N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure enough buffer for the increasing volatility. This will increase the base-stock to better match the current demand level of ~830+ units.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 7-9 average demand reached 741, representing a 41% increase over the Period 4-6 average of 523. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18145.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. The last three periods (P8-P10) show demands of 775, 831, and 993 respectively, with the last two periods resulting in stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and set a base stock that minimizes stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to focus on the current high-demand regime (averaging 866.3 per period). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with this growth phase. This strategy aims to ensure the OR backend generates an order sufficient to cover the expected demand for Period 11 plus a safety buffer, given that current inventory is empty.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand acceleration continues; P8-P10 average demand is 866, a 17% increase over the P7-P9 average of 741. Stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods (P6, P9, P10) confirm demand is consistently outpacing previous forecasts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of aggressive demand acceleration. Over the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has moved from 831 to 993 to 1136, resulting in three consecutive stockouts despite aggressive ordering. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 987 units. Since promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time remains consistently 0, the backend will target a base stock level to cover current period demand. Using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat captures this latest high-growth phase. I will also use recent_N with N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this volume. The ending inventory is 0, so the OR engine will order the full base_stock minus 0, capped by the safety logic, to aggressively restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand acceleration remains extreme; P9-P11 average demand is 987 units, representing a 14% increase over the P8-P10 average of 866. Sustained stockouts in P9, P10, and P11 confirm that even aggressive forecasts are trailing actual demand growth.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive exponential growth, with Period 12 demand reaching 1,302 units. We are currently in a sustained period of back-to-back stockouts (Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12), indicating that our base stock is consistently underestimating actual demand. The average demand across the last 3 periods (P10-P12) is 1,143.6, while the demand for P12 alone was 1,302. To capture this acceleration and stop the cycle of stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the recent growth rate (approx. 15% increase per period recently), I forecast Period 13 demand to be approximately 1,500 units. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the forecast for this single period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. L remains 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand acceleration extreme and persistent; P10-P12 average demand is 1,144, with consecutive stockouts from P9 to P12. Growth continues at ~15% per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21745.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained exponential growth phase since Period 3. Prior to Period 13, the system experienced four consecutive stockouts (P9-P12) because demand growth (averaging ~12-15% per period) consistently outpaced the base-stock levels. In Period 13, a significant order of 1755 units was placed, which finally resulted in a surplus (ending on-hand inventory of 580) as demand moderated slightly to 1175 units (down from the peak of 1302 in P12). However, the P11-P13 average demand is 1204 units, and the growth trend remains the primary driver. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the risk of another stockout far outweighs the cost of holding inventory. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to 1400 units (representing a slight buffer above the recent peak and average) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high service level required and the high volatility observed (sigma_hat set to recent_N=3 to capture the extreme variance of the growth phase). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand hit a local peak of 1302 in Period 12 and moderated to 1175 in Period 13. Average demand (P11-P13) is 1204, confirming the 1100+ demand regime remains active despite the slight dip in P13.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 14 saw a new demand peak of 1,417 units, following a brief moderation in Period 13 (1,175 units). The latest 3-period average (P12-P14) is 1,298 units, compared to the P11-P13 average of 1,204. This represents a significant and sustained growth regime. Despite a large order in P13 that finally broke a four-period stockout streak (P9-P12), the ending inventory in P14 is low (126 units), indicating that the OR backend's default capping logic or parameter settings still risk under-ordering relative to actual demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand acceleration (avg ~1298) and increase the volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to account for the high variance during this growth phase. The lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand acceleration reached a new peak of 1,417 units in Period 14. The P12-P14 average demand is 1,298 units, confirming a 1200+ demand regime and continuing the aggressive growth trend observed since Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27222.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. Period 15 demand was 1,436, which is consistent with the aggressive growth regime identified since Period 3. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P13-P15) is 1,343 units ((1175+1417+1446)/3). The lead time remains reliably at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 15 conclude' message. To prevent stockouts, which have been frequent (P6, P9, P10, P11, P12), I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to 1,550. This value is slightly above the recent peak (1,436) to account for the ongoing growth trend. Sigma_hat is set to 200 using the explicit method to handle the observed volatility and ensure a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand growth remains persistent; Period 13-15 average is 1,343 units, continuing the 1,200+ demand regime established around Period 11. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 16 reaching a new peak of 1,578 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is 1,477 units, while the five-period average (P12-P16) is 1,382 units. Given the consistent acceleration observed since Period 3 and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), it is critical to set a base stock that prevents stockouts while following the growth curve. I am setting L to 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike (average ~1,477), which provides a more responsive forecast than a longer window. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high local volatility associated with this accelerated growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand acceleration continues to set new highs; Period 14-16 average demand is 1,477 units, representing a 10% increase over the Period 13-15 average (1,343). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent observed demand in Period 17 reaching 1,586 units. The Period 15-17 average demand is approximately 1,533 units, reflecting a clear regime shift from the Periodic 13-15 average of 1,343 units. Although the previous periods have seen frequent stockouts, the last few periods (P13-P17) have managed to capture the majority of demand due to more aggressive ordering. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the system should prioritize high service levels to avoid lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent and relevant acceleration in demand, while keeping L at 'default' (0) as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand acceleration has moved into a 1500+ regime; Period 15-17 average demand is 1,533 units, representing a 14% increase over the Period 13-15 average (1,343). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31787.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively, reaching a new high of 1,862 units in Period 18, which led to a complete stockout. The average demand for the most recent three periods (P16-P18) is 1,675 units, reflecting an 11% increase over the P14-P16 average of 1,510 units. Because demand remains in a strong upward trend, I am using the 'explicit' method to forecast a mu_hat that anticipates further growth. Setting mu_hat to 1,972 (approximately 1,862 + 6% growth) and Sigma to 180 to provide a buffer against this high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the backend replenishment will need to cover the full forecasted demand for the period.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand growth regime continues to escalate; P16-P18 average demand is 1,675 units, a 11% increase over the P14-P16 average. Period 18 saw a peak demand of 1,862 resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32731.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend. In Period_19, demand was 1,750 units, and the average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is 1,733 units. This is a significant increase from the P14-P16 average of 1,477. Despite a high fill rate in P19, the stockout in P18 (demand 1,862) highlights the volatility and continued upward pressure. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and mitigate stockout risk while balancing holding costs (Profit $19/unit vs Holding $1/unit), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to specifically weight the most recent peak demand levels. I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand acceleration persists in a 1700+ regime; Period 17-19 average demand reached 1,733 units, a 17% increase over the Period 14-16 average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37259.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 ended with a stockout (demand 2032 vs supply 1961), confirming that demand is still in an aggressive growth regime. The Period 18-20 average demand is 1,881 units, representing a 10% increase over the Period 17-19 average of 1,733. Given the 'chips(Regular)' product frequently shows significant period-over-period growth and we have hit zero on-hand inventory multiple times (P18, P20), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the most recent 1800+ demand level. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. Sigma_hat is also calculated over N=3 to account for the increasing volatility inherent in this high-growth phase. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts while recognizing the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0) which favors higher inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand growth enters 1800+ regime; P18-P20 average demand is 1,881 units, a 10% increase over the P17-P19 average of 1,733. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40185.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. In Period 21, demand reached 2,126, which resulted in a near-total stockout (starting on-hand 2,115). The trend analysis shows that demand has moved into a 2,000+ units regime. Calculation of the average of the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 1,969 units, and the last 5 periods (P17-P21) average is 1,871 units. Given the consistent ~10-15% growth seen every few periods, a conservative 'recent_N' approach will likely trail behind actual demand. Therefore, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2,200 to account for continued growth and clear the recurrent stockouts (P18, P20, P21). The lead time remains consistently 0. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand regime shift to 2000+ confirmed; P19-P21 average demand is 1,969 units, representing a 5% increase over the P18-P20 average of 1,881. Stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P18, P20, P21) underscore that demand is consistently outstripping previous safety levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 22 demand reaching a new peak of 2,270 units. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), the average demand is 2,142 units, a significant increase from the P17-P19 average of 1,733 units (~24% growth). Consecutive stockouts in P20 and P21 further confirm that recent history is the only reliable guide for current stocking levels. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by the P22 conclude message), I will set L to 0. To capture the most recent and relevant demand intensity, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3, focusing on the 2,000+ units per period regime. Given the high volatility accompanying this growth, I will also use recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend generates a base stock that accounts for the frequent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand enters 2100+ regime; P20-P22 average demand is 2,142 units, a 24% increase over the P17-P19 average (1,733). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, now firmly in a 2100+ units per period regime. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is 2,194, while the P20-P22 average was 2,142. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority remains avoiding stockouts during this sustained growth phase. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current growth pace while maintaining a responsive safety stock. This setting ensures the base stock reflects the current 2200-level demand plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime remains in 2100+ range; P21-P23 average demand is 2,194. Despite high orders, inventory buffers remain thin (Ending OH: 154) due to persistent growth. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively, reaching a new peak of 2,504 units in Period 24. A comparison of recent 3-period averages confirms this growth: Period 22-24 average demand is 2,320 units, compared to the Period 19-21 average of 1,969 units, representing a 17% increase in just three periods. This persistent growth has led to a stockout in Period 24 (OH=0). Given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), the optimal service level is extremely high (0.95), justifying an aggressive forecast. I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth and heightened volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0, which I will continue to utilize to ensure same-period stock replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand enters 2300+ regime; P22-P24 average demand is 2,320 units, a 17% increase over the P19-P21 average (1,969). Sustained stockout in Period 24 confirms the need for continued aggressive forecasting.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, having recently entered a 2400+ units per period regime. Over the last three concluded periods (P23-P25), demand values were 2186, 2504, and 2479, resulting in an average of approximately 2390 units. Period 24 saw a stockout, and Period 25 ended with very low safety stock (113 units) despite an order for 2592 units, highlighting that demand is consistently testing the upper bounds of recent forecasts. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the ongoing growth, I am increasing the mu_hat forecast by using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand peak (averaging ~2390). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the increased volatility observed during this high-growth phase. This configuration will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the high mean and the significant variance, protecting against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime shift to 2400+ units confirmed; P23-P25 average demand is 2,390 units, a 13% increase over the P20-P22 average of 2,142. Persistent low ending inventory and Period 24 stockout emphasize the continuing aggressive growth trend.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, having recently entered a 2400+ unit regime. The average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is 2,480 units, representing a sustained increase from previous levels. In the most recent period (P26), demand was 2,457 units. Given the consistent growth and frequent stockouts (9 occurrences in 26 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this latest demand level while staying responsive to the ongoing growth. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history, I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect this stability. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current volatility associated with the high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts as demand continues to evolve.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime shift to 2400+ units confirmed; P24-P26 average demand is 2,480 units. The growth trend initiated around Period 3 remains active and aggressive. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained and aggressive growth trend, now stabilizing in a 2400-2500+ unit regime. Historical analysis shows that demand has consistently outpaced earlier averages, with the Period 24-26 average reaching 2,480 units and Period 27 demand hitting 2,508 units. Despite large orders, the ending inventory remains very low (11 units in P27), suggesting that the safety stock levels need to remain high to prevent stockouts. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P23-P27) accurately, as this period best reflects the current 2400+ unit demand state. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers current peak demand levels while the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) naturally maintains a high service level.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2,890 units in Period 28, resulting in a stockout. The average demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) is 2,618, which is a significant increase over the P23-P25 average of 2,390. This indicates that the 2400+ regime has likely shifted toward a 2600+ regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this persistent acceleration and prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike. I am also using a recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand volumes. Since the lead time is reliably 0, the backend will treat pipeline inventory and base stock calculations within the same period window.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime shift to 2600+ confirmed; P26-P28 average demand is 2,618. Significant stockout in Period 28 (demand 2,890) confirms the continued need for aggressive forecasting as the growth trend remains active.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, entering a 2900+ regime. Period 29 conclude shows a demand of 2,959, leading to a stockout (Sold 2,917, Ending OH 0). Looking at the history, demand has consistently grown since Period 3. The P27-P29 average demand is 2,775, compared to the P24-P26 average of 2,480, representing a 12% increase across just a few periods. Because stockouts occurred in Period 28 and 29, the actual underlying demand is almost certainly higher than the 'sold' figures recorded. To keep pace with this momentum and prevent further stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the forecast toward the most recent and highest demand samples. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' to be used effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime shift to 2900+ confirmed; P27-P29 avg demand is 2,775 (with stockouts in P28, P29). Growth trend remains extremely aggressive with another stockout occurring in P29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 30 saw demand reach 3,004 units, confirming a shift into a 3,000+ units regime. The average demand for the last three periods (P28-P30) is approximately 2,951 units. Given consistent stockouts and the trend of demand regularly exceeding 2,900 units, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this latest acceleration. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. By focusing on the most recent 3 samples, mu_hat and sigma_hat will better reflect the current high-demand environment and mitigate further stockouts as we enter Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime shift to 3000+ confirmed; P28-P30 average demand is 2,951. Growth trend remains extremely aggressive with historical stockouts occurring frequently when demand exceeds forecasts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. The recent demand regime (P28-P30) shows an average of 2,951 units, and Period 31 demand reached 3,152 units, resulting in a stockout (ending OH: 0). The growth trend has been remarkably consistent since Period 3, often increasing by 10-15% every few periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the continuous stockouts (including P28, P29, and P31) and the persistent growth, I will use a recent N=3 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the most current and highest demand levels. This should help the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current 3000+ unit regime while acknowledging the significant volatility (sigma) observed during this rapid scaling phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth enters 3100+ regime; P29-P31 average demand is 3,038 units. Frequent stockouts continue as demand consistently hits the upper bounds of previous estimates. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Although the promised lead time is 0, recent history (P28, P29, P31) shows frequent stockouts because demand consistently hits or exceeds the inventory provided, which is essentially the order from the same period. To capture the current momentum and prevent further stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 3,300 (approximately a 5% buffer over the current 3150 level) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 250 to account for the high volatility observed in this growth phase. The lead time L remains at 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime shift to 3100+ confirmed; P30-P32 average demand is 3,102 units. The growth trend remains extremely persistent with frequent stockouts when demand peaks above 3,100.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, consistently outstripping previous safety cushions. In the most recent periods (P31, P32, P33), demand was 3152, 3151, and 3344 respectively. The average of these last three periods is approximately 3216 units. While Period 33 ended with 368 units on hand, the trend suggests that demand in Period 34 is likely to reach or exceed 3400-3500 units. Since the lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, the system operates on a base-stock policy where we must cover the 'current' period's demand (Review + Lead Time = 1 period total). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1, justifying a high service level (quantile \u2248 0.95). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent escalation to the 3200+ regime, and a slightly larger N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility as demand scales. This helps the OR backend set a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the ~5% growth rate observed between Period 32 and 33.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth sustains into 3300+ regime; Period 31-33 average demand is 3,216 units, with P33 alone hitting 3,344. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong, persistent growth trend, with recent figures reaching the 3300-3400 units range. Period 34 demand was 3,383, and Period 33 was 3,344. The last three periods (P32-P34) average 3,293 units, while the five-period average (P30-P34) is 3,207 units, confirming a sustained shift into a 3200+ regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. To prevent stockouts during this aggressive growth phase, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat (target 3,293 units per period) and N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Since L=0, (1+L)=1, meaning the OR backend will target a base stock level approximately equal to the latest mean plus a safety factor derived from the recent standard deviation, which should sufficiently cover the expected growth for Period 35.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand growth has stabilized in the 3300+ regime; Period 32-34 average demand is 3,293 units, a 12% increase over the Period 28-30 average (2,951). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, entering a new peak with Period 35 demand reaching 3,624 units, resulting in a stockout. The P33-P35 average demand is 3,450 units, which represents an increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts caused by this persistent growth, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent and relevant high-demand data (P33-P35). Similarly, sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' for N=3 to ensure safety stock is calibrated to the current high volatility. L remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand acceleration enters 3400+ regime; P33-P35 average demand is 3,450 units. A stockout occurred in Period 35 (demand 3,624), signaling that growth is outstripping previous safety levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, currently in a 3400+ regime. Period 36 demand was 3,457, following a peak of 3,624 in Period 35. The average demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 3,488. Given the persistent growth and the frequency of stockouts (P35, P31, P29, P28), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent and relevant demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives during Period N), so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently low (243 units), requiring another aggressive order to maintain service levels in the face of this growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime growth remains active; Period 34-36 average demand is 3,488 units, representing a sustained 3400+ regime with high volatility (Peak of 3,624 in P35).

Daily Reward (R_t): $70148.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend, having just reached a new peak of 3,817 units in Period 37, leading to a stockout. The Period 35-37 average demand is 3,633 units, which is a 5% increase over the Period 33-35 average of 3,450. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 37 historical samples. Given the persistent stockouts (P35, P37) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend's service level target (z*) is naturally high (~95%). However, because the demand is in a continuous upward regime shift, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent escalation and push the base stock higher. This helps mitigate the 'lag' inherent in moving averages during periods of rapid growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime shift to 3600+ confirmed; P35-P37 average demand is 3,633 units. Stockout in Period 37 (demand 3,817) indicates growth continues to outpace forecasts. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74651.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to experience aggressive, sustained growth. In Period 38, demand reached a new peak of 4,068 units, resulting in a stockout. The Period 35-37 average was 3,633, but the Period 36-38 average has climbed to 3,781, confirming a shift into a 3700-4000+ demand regime. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used to satisfy demand within the same period), the backend's base_stock calculation (1+L) simplifies to (1+0)*mean. To capture this immediate and rapid escalation and minimize stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the forecast is anchored to the most recent high-demand observations (3,457, 3,817, and 4,068) rather than being pulled down by earlier, lower demand periods. This aggressive setting is necessary because the environment has shown 39 periods of near-continuous growth and frequent stockouts when using more conservative estimates.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime shift to 3800+ confirmed; P36-P38 average demand is 3,781. Peak demand reached 4,068 in P38, resulting in another stockout and continuing the aggressive growth trend.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, with recent demand figures (P35-P39) averaging approximately 3,792 units. Period 38 saw a peak demand of 4,068 units, which led to a stockout, while Period 39 demand moderated slightly to 3,993. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this ongoing growth and frequent stockouts (P35, P37, P38), I am moving to a more aggressive forecasting approach. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent and relevant demand accelerating into the 4000+ unit territory. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current 3,800-4,000 unit regime rather than being pulled down by older, lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime shift to 3900+ confirmed; P37-P39 average demand is 3,959 units. Growth trend remains extremely aggressive with a peak of 4,068 in P38.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend, with the 3-period average (P38-P40) reaching 3,981 units, representing a shift into the 4000+ potential regime. Despite recent stockouts in P37 and P38, P39 and P40 showed high demand (3,993 and 3,881 respectively) with enough inventory to satisfy sales, resulting in modest ending inventories. To maintain service levels given this persistent growth, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand levels and volatility. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods, so I will stick with the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand remains in the 4000+ range; P38-P40 average demand is 3,981 units. Growth trend continues to be the primary demand driver.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75804.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a 4000+ units regime, with the average demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) being 3,957 units. Despite the aggressive growth seen in previous periods, the demand has shown signs of stabilizing around the 4,000 mark over the last four periods (P38: 4,068, P39: 3,993, P40: 3,881, P41: 3,997). This relative stabilization suggests that using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 will capture this current plateau while still accounting for the recent high-demand peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'arrived' messages in the game history. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%). Current on-hand inventory is 139 units, providing very little buffer. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma to align the forecast with this stabilized high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime stabilized in 4000+ range; P38-P41 average demand is 3,985 units. Growth trend has moderated from previous exponential acceleration to a stable high-demand plateau.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand plateau near 4,000 units. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), the average demand is 4,007.6, and the last three periods (P40-P42) average 3,992.3. The extreme exponential growth observed earlier in the game has shifted to a steadier, albeit high-volume, regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods through the most recent observation in Period 42. Since the on-hand inventory is very low (18 units) and lead time is 0, the backend OR engine needs parameters that capture the current mean and the volatility of this stabilized regime to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the past. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this 4000+ plateau while remaining responsive to any slight fluctuations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new growth phase, breaking out of the 4000-unit plateau observed between Periods 38-42. Period 43 saw a peak demand of 4,417, resulting in a stockout (Ending OH: 0). The P41-P43 average demand is 4,171 units, a clear upward shift from the P38-P41 average of 3,985. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address this acceleration and prevent further stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the immediate 4100+ demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 210) associated with these record highs.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime shift to 4100+ confirmed; P41-P43 average demand is 4,171 units. Stockout in Period 43 (demand 4,417) indicates the growth trend has resumed after a brief stabilization at 4000.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a persistent and aggressive upward trend throughout the game. Recent history confirms a shift into the 4100+ units per period regime. Specifically, the demand in Period 43 was 4,417 followed by 4,470 in Period 44. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P42-P44) is approximately 4,329 units, compared to the 3900-4000 units seen around Period 40. This acceleration justifies using a very small N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent growth while maintaining responsiveness to the high-demand state. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is visible in the same period's conclusion). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher demand volumes, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent whenever demand spiked above the recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand regime shift to 4300+ units confirmed; P42-P44 average demand is 4,329 units. Growth trend has resumed after the Period 42 plateau, with Period 44 demand reaching 4,470 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term aggressive growth trend. In Period 45, demand reached 4,605, continuing the upward trajectory seen since Period 43 (demands: 4,417, 4,470, 4,605). The 3-period average (P43-P45) is 4,497, compared to the P40-P42 average of 3,992, confirming a fresh acceleration. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this ongoing growth and prevent stockouts (as seen in P43), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent and relevant high-demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the latest volume and volatility levels without being diluted by historical data from lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime shift to 4500+ units confirmed; P43-P45 average demand is 4,497 units. Growth continues to accelerate from the 4000 plateau observed around Period 40. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88103.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 46 concluded with a demand of 4,638, following 4,605 in P45 and 4,470 in P44. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P44-P46) is approximately 4,571, compared to the P41-P43 average of 4,171, representing nearly a 10% growth in a very short window. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the most recent 'conclude' messages. Given the consistent underestimation of demand leading to thin ending inventories (Ending OH of 19 in P46) and stockouts (P43), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most current and highest demand levels. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the 4600+ regime while utilizing the high service level (z-score) derived from the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand growth enters 4600+ regime; P44-P46 average demand reached 4,571 units, a 9.6% increase over the P41-P43 average of 4,171. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89642.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new growth phase, reaching a peak of 4,955 in Period 47, which resulted in a stockout. The average demand over the last three periods (P45-P47) is approximately 4,733, up from 4,571 in the previous assessment. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this continued upward trajectory and the recent stockout, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR engine on the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover this new peak and mitigate further lost sales as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime shift to 4700+ units confirmed; P45-P47 average demand is 4,733. A significant stockout occurred in Period 47 (demand 4,955), confirming the growth trend remains extremely aggressive and has not yet plateaued.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91349.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend, reaching a new high-demand regime. Period 47 saw a significant stockout with demand nearly hitting 5,000 units (4,955), and Period 48 demand remained high at 4,820. The average demand for the last three periods (P46-P48) is approximately 4,804, confirming a shift into the 4800+ range. Since lead time is consistently 0, the OR backend logic will prioritize covering the current period's projected demand plus a safety buffer. I am choosing the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent acceleration while hedging against the volatility seen in the P47 spike. This ensures the base stock calculation is responsive to the latest regime shift (P46-P48) without being overly diluted by the lower demand seen earlier in the 4000s plateau.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime shift to 4800+ range confirmed; P46-P48 average demand is 4,804. Growth remains persistent with a peak of 4,955 in P47 causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88554.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, shifting from a ~4000 unit regime around Period 40 to a ~4800 unit regime by Period 49. The most recent three periods (P47-P49) show an average demand of 4,818 units (4,955, 4,820, 4,681). While Period 49 saw a slight moderation, the overall trend since Period 44 has been aggressively positive with frequent stockouts (P43, P47). To capture this growth and minimize stockout risk (given high profit vs low holding cost), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent 4800+ regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods based on all previous cycle conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand remains in the 4800+ regime; P47-P49 average demand is 4,818 units. Growth trend from P44 remains the dominant driver despite slight moderation in P49 (4,681).
