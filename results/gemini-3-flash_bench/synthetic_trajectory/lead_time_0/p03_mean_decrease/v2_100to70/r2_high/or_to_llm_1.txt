With 91 units on hand and 0 in-transit, ordering 53 units would bring total availability to 144 units for Period 23.

While the OR recommendation of 91 units is mathematically sound based on historical data, I need to ensure the total available inventory (On-hand + Order) is sufficient to handle the recent average plus a safety buffer for volatility without incurring excessive holding costs. Starting on-hand is 50. Ordering 91 units brings total inventory to 141.

If I follow the OR recommendation of 57, my total available quantity for Period 32 would be 139 (82 + 57). Given the maximum observed demand in the current regime is 97 (P26), 139 units provides ample safety stock.

  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (Actual lead time = 0). Since Period 49 is the penultimate period and Period 50 is the final period, the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged 62.1 units, though it remains volatile (ranging from 31 to 81). The OR recommendation is 44 units. On-hand inventory is currently 87 units. If I follow the OR recommendation of 44, total available stock for Period 49 will be 131 units. Based on historical peaks (max 152, recent max 81), 131 units is more than sufficient to cover even a significant spike, but might leave excessive inventory for the final period. However, since total periods = 50, and I need to account for Period 49 demand now and Period 50 demand in the next step, I will align closer to the OR recommendation to ensure no stockouts occur before the game ends, while staying slightly conservative to manage ending stock.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The confirmed actual lead time is 0 periods, as orders placed in a period arrive within that same period, allowing them to satisfy demand immediately. Analysis of the recent demand history (P40-P49) shows a mean of approximately 64.4 units with significant fluctuations (range 31-83). The OR recommendation of 76 units is based on a base-stock level of approximately 130 units (Base Stock = On-hand 54 + Order 76). This target level of 130 units provides a safe buffer against the observed demand volatility while minimizing holding costs. Since P50 is the final period of the game, the objective is to satisfy expected demand while avoiding excess ending inventory that incurs holding costs. A target inventory of 130 is sufficient to cover even the highest demand spikes seen recently (83 units) with a reasonable margin, ensuring no lost sales in the final period.",
