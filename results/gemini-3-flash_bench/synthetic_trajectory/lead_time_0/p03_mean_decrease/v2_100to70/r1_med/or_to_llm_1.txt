The OR algorithm recommends an order of 122 units, which is calculated using the base-stock policy (mean demand + safety stock) and capped for stability. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile), a safety stock buffer is appropriate.

There is significant volatility (std dev ~32).\n3. Inventory Position: We currently have 63 units on-hand. Since L=0, we need enough stock to cover the upcoming Period 2 demand.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 53 units. Let's look at the OR logic: base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302. With L=0, \u03bc\u0302 = 87. Profit=$4, Holding=$1, so critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. z* (0.8) \u2248 0.84. Base stock = 87 + 0.84 * 32 \u2248 114. Order = 114 - 63 = 51. The OR recommendation of 53 is very close to this calculation.
