Looking at historical data for this SKU, demand in the first five periods was 61, 107, 84, 144, and 69, yielding an average of roughly 93 units per period. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the high variance (61 to 144) and the fact that stock-out costs ($4 profit loss) are four times higher than holding costs ($1), I should lean toward the higher side of the average. I will order 120 units to provide a buffer for potential high demand in Period 1, while keeping in mind that since lead time is 0, these units will arrive and be available to satisfy demand this same period.",
