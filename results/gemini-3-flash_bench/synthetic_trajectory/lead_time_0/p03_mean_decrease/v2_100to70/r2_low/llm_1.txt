Since lead time is 0, the inventory position needs to cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will forecast Period 3 demand towards the higher end of the range given recent volatility (approx 120 units) to ensure high service level, while being mindful that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), which penalizes overstocking.
