Given the high parity between profit and holding cost, the critical fractile (0.5) suggests keeping a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs while still meeting average demand.

The OR recommendation of 93 units aligns exactly with the historical mean.

Given the recent stockouts (P2 demand 117 vs 89 sold; P3 demand 122 vs 93 sold), 97 units is likely insufficient as it reflects a mean that doesn't fully capture recent spikes.

A 0.5 fractile targets the median demand.\n5. Adjustment: Since lead time is 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (which occurs after our decision). Given the high volatility (peak of 122), relying on the OR's median-based recommendation (63) after starting with 33 on-hand (total 96) is reasonable but slightly conservative.

The carry-over insight noted a regime shift suspecting a mean of ~135, but Period 10's drop suggests high variance. Current on-hand inventory is 68. There are 0 units in-transit. 3. OR Baseline Review: The OR recommendation is 30 units. This is based on a conservative base-stock calculation. Given the recent demand variability (reaching 150), a target stock levels for a 0-lead-time cycle (covering current period demand) should be around 130-140 units. With 68 on hand, ordering 30 (leading to 98 units available) is risky if demand rebounds to the 120-150 range. 4. Strategic Adjustment: I will increase the order from the OR baseline of 30 to 70 units. This provides a total availability of 138 units (68 on-hand + 70 new order), which covers the high-demand scenarios observed recently while mitigating excessive holding costs if demand remains at the lower Period 10 level.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical evidence from 'concluded' periods consistently confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~80 units over the last 15-20 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units. The OR baseline recommends ordering 66 units, which aligns with a target inventory level of ~83 units (on-hand + order). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting the goal is to meet the median demand. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows variations between 31 and 83, with an average of approximately 65. Ordering 66 units brings the total available stock to 83 units, which safely covers the higher end of recent demand observations without incurring excessive holding costs. No missing shipments or lead time delays are evident.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 66 units as recommended by OR to reach a total available stock of 83. This matches recent demand patterns and maintains a zero-period lead time strategy.",
