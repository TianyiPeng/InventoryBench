The product is 'chips(Regular)', a stable consumer good, but historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) show high variability with a mean of 93 units and a standard deviation of approximately 33. Since the order placed now arrives in time for Period 1 demand (L=0), and we have 0 on-hand inventory, we must order enough to cover Period 1. To account for the high variance and minimize stockouts on the first day, I will order slightly above the historical average.

Period 1 demand was 59 units, leaving 51 units on hand. Historical demand over 5 periods shows values: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. For Period 2, I need to cover the current period's demand. Average demand is around 93 units. Given the high variability (high of 144, low of 61) and a holding cost of only $1 compared to a profit of $19, it is optimal to maintain a high service level. Demand for Period 2 is recorded in history as 107. Since lead time is 0, orders arrive before demand resolution. Calculation: To target availability for a potential high-demand period (approx 140-150 units) and accounting for the 51 units on hand, I should order enough to reach a safe inventory level.
