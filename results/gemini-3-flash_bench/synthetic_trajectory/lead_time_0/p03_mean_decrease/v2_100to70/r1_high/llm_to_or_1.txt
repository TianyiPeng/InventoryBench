  Samples: [('Period_1', 61), ('Period_2', 107), ('Period_3', 84), ('Period_4', 144), ('Period_5', 69)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context, arrivals, or previous demand beyond the provided samples. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand across five periods shows significant volatility (min: 61, max: 144, mean: 93). Given the provided 5-period sample data, I will use these to seed the initial forecast. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviation to capture the essence of these recent observations, and 'default' for lead time (0). This approach targets a service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), ensuring we build enough stock to cover the expected immediate demand since lead time is 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 59 and the order of 149 units arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), leaving 90 units on-hand for Period 2. The historical demand data provided (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) has a mean of 93 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.5. Since the promised lead time is 0 and the actual lead time observed in Period 1 was 0, I will use L=0. I will set mu_hat to the mean of the 5 historical samples plus the observed Period 1 demand (Total 6 samples: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69, 59; Mean = 87.33) and adjust for (1+L). I'll use recent_N=6 to capture all known demand points to stabilize the base stock calculation, given the relatively high volatility (range 59-144).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1358.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) has been consistently 0 periods (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived within the same period). Historical demand for the first two periods was 59 and 75. The starting on-hand inventory for Period 3 is 67. Since the lead time is 0, the target base stock needs to cover the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). The average demand of the first two samples is 67. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is approximately 0.95, justifying a relatively high safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand levels and 'calculate' for L to leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Profit: $1634.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the demand spiked to 131, which was significantly higher than the on-hand inventory (86), resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Looking at the historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69), there is high volatility but a clear upward trend in the recent periods compared to the very first. Specifically, Period 3 saw demand of 131 (realized) and Period 4 saw demand of 144 (based on user-provided demand history). This suggests the initial mean was too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent higher-demand regime (averaging approx 120 units/period) while maintaining the 'default' lead time of 0. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to better reflect the increased volatility seen in the spikes to 131 and 144.

Daily Reward (R_t): $989.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Demand has been volatile: P1=59, P2=75, P3=131, P4=57, and P5=69 (from historical sample). The mean demand over 5 periods is approximately 78.2. Period 3 saw a significant demand spike (131) which led to a stockout. Currently, we have 94 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Since L=0, the base stock targets the current period's demand (1+L=1). Using all 5 samples for the moving average (recent_N=5) provides a stable mean of ~78 and accounts for the high-demand outlier in P3 to maintain a sufficient safety buffer, preventing future stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2051.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is 20 units. Historical data for the first five periods shows total demand of 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (average ~93, std ~34). However, the 'conclude' messages show demand values that differ slightly (59, 75, 131, 57, 109). Using the provided sample data (Period 1-5 mean = 93, std = 33.7), and noting that the promised lead time L=0 has been consistently observed (actual lead time was 0 in all cases), I will use the 'default' method for L. Given the high variability in demand and a stockout in Period 3, I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history while balancing against the inventory risk. Since profit is high ($19) and holding cost is low ($1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2400.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low at 13 units after Period 6 demand of 127 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Observed demand over the first 6 periods has been volatile (range: 57 to 131, mean: ~93), with the most recent sample (127) being significantly higher than the average. To avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 3, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the full recent history which shows high variance. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using these 6 samples to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed demand spikes while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $771.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear trend or seasonal pattern established yet (Period 1-7 demand: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46). The mean demand over these 7 periods is approximately 86.4, with a standard deviation around 34.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no significant regime shift detected (demand fluctuates around the mean), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive to future shifts. The backend will calculate the base stock to target a service level of approximately 95% (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), with mu_hat representing (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat representing sqrt(1+L)*std.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2155.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 8 periods has shown significant fluctuations, ranging from 46 to 131, with a mean of approximately 90. There is no clear seasonal or regime shift yet, as the data oscillates. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P8 arrived in the same period). The current on-hand inventory is 30 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) using N=8 to capture the full recent history of this inventory cycle, while keeping L at 'default' since the 0-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1673.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 56 units with no units in transit. Historical demand for periods 1-9 are: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46, 115, 91. The mean demand is approximately 90 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 31. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent history confirms that arrivals occur in the same period (L=0). There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonal trend yet, so I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (all available game history periods) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Using N=9 helps smooth out the high variance (range 46-131) seen in early periods while prioritizing the most recent observations over the pre-game samples.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 42 units with no units in transit. Historical analysis of Periods 1-10 shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The demand has fluctuated between 46 and 131 units, with a mean demand of approximately 91.2 units over the last 10 periods (samples: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46, 115, 91, 101). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (approx 95%). I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time as the 0-period lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand distribution accurately while covering the (L+1) period (i.e., the current period's demand).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 38 units, while the mean demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 92.27 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand appears relatively stable without clear regime shifts or seasonal trends in the provided period markers (Period 1-11). I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time to confirm the observed 0-period trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent statistics while smoothing out individual period volatility. This approach ensures we maintain a base stock high enough to cover the expected demand of ~92 units and account for the observed standard deviation (approx 28), balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 12 periods. The actual observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the inventory and demand behavior are relatively consistent, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture current demand levels (averaging ~94.8 units/period in the game history) while filtering out the initial period 0 data. On-hand inventory is currently at 49, with 0 units in transit. Setting L to default (0 periods) remains correct based on consistent historical arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Since the start of the game, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The demand history across the first 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 94.6 units per period (Sample mean of P1-P13: (59+75+131+57+109+127+46+115+91+101+104+92+122)/13 = 1229/13 \u2248 94.54). There is high variability (ranging from 46 to 131), but no clear regime shift or seasonal trend is evident yet from the provided dates (Period_1 through Period_13). For Period 14, I will use 'calculate' for lead time (L) as it has been stable at 0. For demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 covering the entire observed history to capture the current demand distribution accurately. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 95 units per period over the 14 historical periods, ranging from 46 to 131, with a slight upward trend in recent variance. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no on-hand inventory deficit (starting on-hand was 56) and no in-transit units, I am setting the base stock to cover the expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the recent 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime more accurately than the full history, as early periods showed more volatility in order sizes. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods with no significant seasonal or regime shifts observed. The average demand across all 15 periods is 95.3, with the most recent 10 periods (P6-P15) showing an average of 98.2 and the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) showing an average of 98.4. Since the demand is consistent, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history (which includes early fluctuations like P3's high demand of 131). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the period it was placed; therefore, I will use the default lead time. The service level provided by the OR backend (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95) is appropriate for this SKU given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with a slight drop observed in the most recent period (Period 16 demand: 46). The historical demand mean (including the seed data and game history) is approximately 91 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), a high service level is desirable. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 (all game periods) to capture the trend while excluding the potentially less relevant seed data, ensuring the model reacts to the actual game environment. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=16 to reflect observed volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 90 units over the 17 concluded periods, but with some variability. Specifically, demand in the last five periods has been slightly lower (avg 74.8 units) compared to the overall average. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrive in the same period), I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using observed data. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture the current regime more accurately than using the full history, while still maintaining a sufficient sample size to smooth out noise. The critical service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95, which the OR backend will use to determine the safety stock. With 75 units on hand, the backend will order enough to meet this high service level requirement for the upcoming period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 18, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but generally remains within a stable range. Over the last 18 periods, the mean demand is approximately 88.7 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean has slightly decreased to 73.2 units, but given the overall inventory strategy and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the service level should remain high. No missing shipments or significant lead-time shifts have been detected. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to dynamically track performance, and 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the long-term stable average while incorporating the slightly more recent variance. This will help maintain a robust base stock level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 19 periods. There are no clear seasonal shifts or trend changes. The mean demand for the entire period is approximately 87, and the mean for the last 10 periods is approximately 88, suggesting a consistent regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture any gentle drift while maintaining a solid statistical base. With L=0, the target base stock will be roughly mean + z*std. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 20 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has averaged approximately 86.15 units per period with a standard deviation of 25.13. All orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory (on-hand is 49). Given the stable demand pattern and reliable lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain the 0-period expectation. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable regime while smoothing out the noise from the most recent 15 periods (roughly 3 weeks of daily-equivalent data). The backend OR logic will use these parameters to determine the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) and place an order to bring current inventory up to that level, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 21 periods. I've analyzed the demand history: the overall mean is approximately 88.8 units per period, while the mean of the most recent 10 periods (P12-P21) is 83.0 units. There are no clear seasonal shifts or calendar events identified from the 'Period_X' labels. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently at 34 units on-hand with nothing in transit. To maintain the target service level (high profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target around 95%), I will use recent history (N=10) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent mean is slightly lower than the long-term average, which prevents overstocking. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period efficiency.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 85.5 units and a standard deviation of 23.3 over the last 10 periods (P13-P22). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 95% (q = 19/20). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, and 'default' for lead time since the promised lead time of 0 periods matches the actual observed performance perfectly. This ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the 95th percentile of demand for the current period while accounting for current inventory on-hand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 23 periods, with a mean around 88.5 units per period. The historical data (Period 1-23) shows mean = 88.4 and standard deviation = 23.5. However, focusing on more recent performance (last 10 periods, P14-P23) shows a mean of 80.0, indicating a slight softening or stabilization compared to the earlier periods. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) after a demand of 101 in Period 23. To prevent stockouts and maintain a target service level of approximately 95% (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1), I will use the recent 10-period average for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most current trend while setting the lead time parameter to 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the last 24 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units. Recent performance (Periods 20-24) shows a slightly lower average of 82.4 units. I will use a recent N=10 window to capture the current demand mean and volatility, balancing longer-term stability with recent fluctuations. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since L=0, the OR backend's target base stock will be calculated for the current period (L+1=1), which is appropriate given the 0-period lead time and current on-hand inventory of 48 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 25 periods. Comparing the most recent 10 periods (avg ~81 units) to the initial 15 periods (avg ~90 units), there is a slight decrease but no major regime shift. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent_N (N=15) for demand and standard deviation to capture the most relevant recent behavior while filtering out the slightly higher demand seen in the early periods. This covers the current period's risk. The critical task is to maintain enough stock to meet demand arriving within the same period (L=0). Current on-hand is low (26), so the OR backend will calculate an order based on these parameters to replenish to the base stock level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 26 periods, with a mean of approximately 85 units and a standard deviation around 22 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. The current on-hand inventory is low (10 units), and there is no pipeline inventory. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is approximately 95%, which justifies maintaining a robust base stock to avoid stockouts (as seen in Period 3). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out shorter-term fluctuations. Lead time will be set to 'default' as the observed actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant structural shifts. Over the course of 27 periods, the average demand is approximately 85.5 units per period. The recent history (last 5-10 periods) maintains this level (p23: 101, p24: 59, p25: 80, p26: 106, p27: 63), averaging around 82 units. Given the consistency, a 'default' approach using all available historical samples for the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) is robust. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, L=0 is the reliable setting. On-hand inventory is currently 57, and there are no units in transit. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers the demand for the current period, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1031.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward shift over the last 15 periods (approx. 79 units/period) compared to the overall historical average (approx. 86 units/period). The most recent 5 periods (Periods 24-28) averaged 73.2 units/period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies inventory management as replenishments arrive within the same phase as the demand resolution. I will use a recent_N approach (N=15) for both demand and volatility to capture the moderate downward trend while maintaining enough data points for stability. At an on-hand inventory of 71 units, and an expected demand around 73-80, the system will place a moderate replenishment order to maintain the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend in mean over the last 10 periods (avg ~77) compared to the all-time mean (avg ~84). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use a window of N=10 for both demand and sigma to capture this recent stability while maintaining a sufficient buffer, as on-hand inventory is currently healthy (44 units) and there's no indicated seasonality or supply disruption. Using recent_N=10 allows for a more responsive base stock calculation to the current demand regime without being overly volatile.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time L=0 is consistently observed across all 30 periods (orders always arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 17. Looking at recent demand history (last 10 periods, P21-P30), the average demand is 82.4 units per period (95, 84, 101, 59, 80, 106, 63, 58, 63, 91). The demand doesn't show a significant sustained regime shift compared to the overall history, but it fluctuates significantly period-to-period. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture mid-term demand volatility while smoothing out shorter-term noise. This ensures the base stock calculation, which targets a high service level due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), remains responsive to the underlying demand distribution. Since L=0, the target base stock aims to cover the current period's demand.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 31 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with oscillations. Comparing recent performance (last 10 periods, avg 79.9) to the overall history (avg 86.2), there is a slight downward trend in mean demand. Period 30 and 31 demand were 91 and 89 respectively, while the on-hand inventory is currently low at 25 units. Since L=0, the order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this $19 profit / $1 holding cost item (suggesting a ~95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand mean and volatility, which better reflects the current trend than the full history.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 32 concluded periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Over the last 15 periods (since Period 18), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 82.5 units per period. The standard deviation across the entire history is approximately 21.6. I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods for both mu_hat (the review+lead time demand) and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand regime while maintaining a sufficient sample size for variance. Since L=0, the formula (1+L) simplifies to 1. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward shift. Comparing the last 10 periods (P24-P33) with the preceding 10 (P14-P23), the average demand decreased from 80.0 to 75.1. The most recent period (P33) saw a significant drop to 37 units, although demand remains volatile. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I am setting L to default. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility while smoothing out the outlier from Period 33, ensuring the base stock level targets the 95% service level appropriate for the $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 34 periods, with an overall mean of approximately 83 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a slightly lower average of 77 units, and the most recent demand in Period 34 was 71 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to the low holding cost ($1), the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating a policy that sufficiently covers demand variance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the slightly lower recent demand trend while maintaining a robust sigma_hat using 'default' to capture historical volatility and ensure adequate safety stock. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrived within the same period they were placed). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows no significant structural shift or strong seasonality over the last 35 periods, though it exhibits moderate volatility with recent demands for P33-P35 being 37, 71, and 41. Given the steady lead time and stable long-term average (approx 83 units/period), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend confirm the 0-period history. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use a window of the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current regime's average and standard deviation while smoothing out the very low demand seen in the most recent three periods. This protects against under-ordering if demand returns to its long-term mean while maintaining a healthy service level (safety stock) given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 36 periods, with a slight decrease in the mean demand in the more recent history. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is approximately 75 units, whereas the overall mean is closer to 85. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally target a high service level. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the most recent demand regime and ensure the base stock is responsive to the current trend while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to confirm the 0-period lead time from previous observations.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 37 periods. Analysis of the recent 10 periods (P28-P37) shows a mean demand of 63.3 units/period, which is lower than the overall historical mean of approximately 83. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. Since the profit per unit ($19) is much higher than the holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the slightly lower recent demand levels while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate base stock. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current volatility (std dev of ~22 for the last 10 periods).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts observed in the recent period (P25-P38). The mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 73 units, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 83. Given the consistent actual lead time of 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand within the same period), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the most recent demand regime and ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the slightly lower average demand observed in the latter half of the game history, while still maintaining a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend in the most recent 10-15 periods compared to the early game. The mean demand for periods 1-39 is approximately 80.5, but the mean of the last 15 periods (25-39) is approximately 75.4, and the last 10 periods (30-39) is 70.9. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (the critical ratio q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use the last 10 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This identifies a more recent demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods as promised, so L remains at 'default'. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) provides a responsive forecast to the recent lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Mean demand decreased from ~84 in periods 1-24 to ~71 in periods 30-39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained downward shift starting around Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to Period 40 is approximately 75 units, compared to a higher historical mean of 84. The Carry-over Insight from Period 40 specifically noted this shift. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 19) following a demand of 88 in Period 40. I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=11 (Periods 30-40) to capture this lower regime while maintaining a safety stock through sigma_hat. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistics for the current demand environment to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 30. The average demand across the last 12 periods (P30-P41) is approximately 75 units, compared to the earlier historical average of ~84. Inventory management is functioning well with the promised lead time of 0 consistently holding true (confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered). With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (~0.95), suggesting the OR backend will target a high service level. To align with the current demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent mean and volatility trends.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to 42 is approximately 74.4 units per period, which is lower than the initial historical mean (P1-P24 avg was ~84). The promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true throughout the game, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this sustained lower demand regime while maintaining a responsive inventory level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (recent_N=13), which covers the detection of the shift in Period 30 up to the current period 43. This N is chosen to capture the full length of the current regime for a stable yet accurate estimate. Lead time L will remain as 'default' since the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow the lower-regime pattern identified around Period 40, with an average demand of approximately 76 units over the last 4 periods (P40-P43: 88, 75, 66, 79). The historical lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I am using recent_N=14 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which encompasses the data since approximately Period 30, capturing the sustained lower demand regime while providing enough samples for a stable standard deviation. This approach ensures the inventory covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer appropriate for the current volatility and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.95), preventing stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since approximately Period 30. Over the last 15 periods (P30-P44), the average demand is roughly 73 units, compared to the initial periods. Recent demand (P40-P44) continues this trend with values of 88, 75, 66, 79, and 71 (mean ~76). I will use a window of N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand level and its associated volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to 45 is approximately 71.3 units per period. The recent history (last 16 periods) reflects this shift and includes both high and low variance observations (e.g., 37 in P33 and 105 in P32). Using a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this shifted mean and local volatility correctly. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history, so the default lead time (promised L=0) is appropriate. With on-hand inventory at 48 units and zero in-transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size to meet the base stock levels for the next period, balancing a high service level ($19 profit) against a low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift noted in the carry-over insights at Period 40 remains consistent. Comparing the initial periods (1-24) where demand averaged ~84 to the recent periods (30-46), there is a clear sustained reduction in mean demand. Specifically, over the last 17 periods (30-46), the mean demand is approx 71.1. In the most recent 7 periods (40-46), demand has averaged 70.3 with slightly lower volatility. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally hold a safety buffer. Using recent_N=17 for mu_hat captures this new regime accurately. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Setting L to 'calculate' will use this 0-period history. I will use recent_N=17 for sigma_hat to match the demand regime's volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow the lower-regime pattern identified around Period 40. Analysis of recent history (Periods 40-47) shows a mean demand of approximately 71 units, consistent with the shift observed earlier. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 25 units with nothing in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N with N=10 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the most recent stable demand regime while providing sufficient smoothing for volatility. This ensures the OR engine maintains enough stock to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means demand occurs after decision) without excessive holding costs.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), suggesting a target service level of approximately 95%. Historical demand shows a regime shift around Period 30, with demand averaging ~72 units per period since then (compared to the earlier ~84). Recent demand (Periods 40-48) confirms this level, averaging ~73 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. However, at the start of Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, following a stockout in Period 48 where demand (91) exceeded available stock (87). We need to replenish immediately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the stable regime from Period 30 onwards) to capture the current mean and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=19 to account for recent volatility. L remains 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $855.00, Daily Holding Cost: $56.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $799.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at a lower regime as noted in Period 40. Analysis of the most recent 10 periods (P40-P49) shows a mean demand of approximately 70.3 units per period. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical data confirms that orders typically arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time 0). The ending inventory for Period 49 is 56 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system targets a high service level. Setting L to the promised lead time of 0 is appropriate given consistent same-period arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current lower demand regime and its volatility (approx 13 units std dev), ensuring the order covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for stockouts seen in Period 48.
