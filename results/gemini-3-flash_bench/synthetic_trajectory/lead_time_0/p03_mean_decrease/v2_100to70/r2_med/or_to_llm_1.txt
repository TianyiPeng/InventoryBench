Given the average demand of ~75-80 in the long term but lower recent values, ordering 47 units brings total availability to 107. If demand in P49 is ~75, we start P50 with 32 units. If demand in P50 is also ~75, we would stock out. However, since I can place one final order in Period 50 to cover that period's demand exactly, I should focus on ensuring I don't overstock now.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is 24 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in the same period (Period N). Therefore, the order placed now will arrive before Period 50 demand is resolved. The demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 35) has averaged 65.5 units, with a maximum of 88 and a minimum of 31. This indicates a slightly lower and more stable demand regime than the long-term historical mean (~83). The OR recommendation of 83 units aims to reach a base-stock level that accounts for the historical mean and variance. However, given the actual recent average of 65.5 and the current on-hand of 24, an order of 83 units would result in a starting inventory of 107 units for Period 50. Since the maximum demand seen in the recent regime is 88, 107 units provides a safe buffer while minimizing holding costs for the final period of the game. I will follow the OR recommendation as it align well with covering potential spikes (like Period 49's 83) while preventing stockouts in the final round.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 83 units. With lead time 0, this creates a starting inventory of 107 units, which safely covers the recent demand range (31-88) for the final period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Recent demand regime (P35-P49) has stabilized at a lower mean of 65.5 units compared to the historical average, with lower volatility (max 88).",

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime (P35-P49) has stabilized at a lower mean of 65.5 units compared to the historical average, with lower volatility (max 88).
