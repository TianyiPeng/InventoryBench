Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical demand mean of approximately 93 units (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The promised lead time is 0. With profit = $1 and holding cost = $1, the critical ratio is 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which results in a service level target (z*) of 0. Since on-hand is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to place an order immediately. I will use the mean of all historical samples as the baseline for demand forecasting. For L, I will start with the promised lead time of 0. I will monitor for lead-time drift in subsequent periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 93 units and 93 units arrived (actual lead time L=0). Starting inventory was 93, demand was 59, leaving 34 units on hand. For Period 2, we need to anticipate demand. Historically, we have 5 samples: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. Mean demand is ~93. The L=0 promise was met in P1. I will use 'calculate' for L to use observed data. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'default' (mean of all samples) as no clear regime shift is visible yet. For sigma (sigma_hat), I will also use 'default'. Since L=0, mu_hat will effectively represent (1+0)*mean.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first five samples (from prompt data) and the first two observed periods shows significant volatility ([61, 107, 84, 144, 69] and observed [59, 75]). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. This means the backend target inventory (base stock) will naturally gravitate towards the median. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility while keeping L as default (0) to reflect the observed same-period arrivals.

Daily Profit: $87.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the demand spiked to 131 units, resulting in a stockout (87 units sold, 0 remaining). The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first three periods (59, 75, 131) and the additional pre-game samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) suggest significant volatility. The mean of all 8 available demand points is approximately 91.25, but the recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 88.33 with a specific spike in Period 3. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed in Period 1, 2, and 3 concludes), I will set L to 'default' (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend and volatility while still maintaining a reasonable sample size to avoid overreacting to the single stockout event. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance observed in the demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period (P1-P4). The demand history shows significant volatility (P1: 59, P2: 75, P3: 131, P4: 57, P5 user-provided: 69). The average across all 5 periods is approximately 78.2. Period 3 showed a significant spike (131) which resulted in a stockout (sold 87 of 131 demanded) because the base stock calculation was likely too conservative. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (50th percentile). However, with high variability (Std Dev \u2248 28), setting base stock to the mean alone risks frequent stockouts. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain the 0-period lead time, 'recent_N' for mu_hat using all 5 samples to capture the recent mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility from the Period 3 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility over the first five periods (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean demand is approximately 93 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is q = 0.5, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand over the review+lead period (1+L). Based on the 5 periods of history, mean demand is 93. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance and mean, and use 'calculate' for lead time to acknowledge the observed 0-period performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we ended with 0 inventory despite ordering 87 units, as demand was 127. Over the first 6 periods, demand has shown significant variability (min 57, max 131) with a mean of 93. Demand in the last two periods (109, 127) has been consistently higher than the initial mean. Although the promised lead time is 0, we have stockouts in 3 of the 6 periods (P3, P5, P6), suggesting that our previous target stock levels were insufficient to cover the high demand variance. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median demand. To prevent further stockouts and capture the recent upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to weigh the recent higher demand more heavily, and explicit sigma_hat set slightly higher (30) to ensure better coverage given the high variability observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 periods has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from 46 to 131. The mean demand across all observed periods (including those provided in the prompt) is approximately 88.5 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z*=0) to balance stockout and holding costs. Every period thus far has shown an actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and variability, while setting L to 'default' as the lead time of 0 is stable.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the item 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 0 and no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-8 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent values of 127 (P6), 46 (P7), and 115 (P8). Currently, the system is frequently stocking out (ending on-hand inventory was 0 in Periods 3, 5, 6, and 8), suggesting our base stock levels are too low to handle demand spikes given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 0.5). I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=8 to capture the average of all full-period data, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the high variance observed (standard deviation is roughly 32). This should raise the base stock enough to reduce stockouts while respecting the holding cost constraint.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand across the first 9 periods has been high (mean \u2248 90, with peaks over 130), frequently resulting in stockouts because the OR system's base stock calculation (which includes a cap) hasn't fully covered the realized demand when assuming L=0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To reduce stockouts, I will use recent demand data (all 9 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Although L is 0, setting parameters to cover the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision) is crucial. Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, but the backend's cap mechanism often limits the order size below actual demand peaks; therefore, utilizing the full sample size (N=9) provides a stable estimate of the mean (90) and standard deviation (31) to guide the OR logic.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 91.1 units, but many periods have ended with stockouts (0 inventory), indicating that the realized demand frequently exceeds the available supply (capped by the OR backend's logic). The historical samples provided (Periods 1-5: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69) and the demand observed in the game history (Periods 1-10: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46, 115, 91, 101) show high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 30). Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally target the median demand. However, due to frequent stockouts (Periods 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), the true demand mean is likely higher than the 'sold' units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while ensuring the system attempts to cover the higher end of the demand distribution to mitigate lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0, while recent demand levels have consistently hovered around 100 units per period. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P8-P11) experienced demand of 115, 91, 101, and 104, while the initial historical samples ranged from 61 to 144. The observed lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day delivery). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, although the OR backend's inventory cap includes a 95% service level buffer. Given the frequent stockouts (P8, P9, P10, P11 all ended at 0 with lost sales), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand regime of approximately 103 units, which is slightly higher than the overall average but steady. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~103 units/period over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), consistently exceeding current supply levels and leading to stockouts.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled at a higher level than the initial samples suggested. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged approximately 100.6 units (115, 91, 101, 104, 92). The system has experienced frequent stockouts because the ordered quantities (capped by the OR backend's logic) have consistently been lower than realized demand. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, historical volatility is high (std \u2248 30 in the early periods, but currently suppressed by stockouts). To recover from 0 on-hand inventory and meet this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the stable P8-P12 period) and maintaining the calculate method for lead time, which has consistently been 0 periods. This will increase the base stock level to better reflect the ~100 units/period demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a consistent pattern of stockouts where the starting inventory (governed by the OR engine's capped order) is almost always lower than the actual demand. Over periods 8-13, demand has been 115, 91, 101, 104, 92, and 122 respectively. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 104.16. Since inventory starts at 0 and lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by the conclude messages), the inventory needs to be higher to capture the spikes (like the 122 in Period 13 and 131 in Period 3). I will use the last 6 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect this higher demand regime, as the earlier periods (e.g., Period 7 at 46 units) are pulling the average down too far, resulting in lost sales. Setting L to 'calculate' is safe as the lead time has remained consistently 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained higher regime compared to the initial periods. Over the last 7 periods (P8-P14), demand has averaged approximately 101.4 units, frequently hitting the stockout ceiling (sold = on-hand). The current on-hand inventory is 20, and there are no units in-transit. The lead time (L) is consistently 0 (units arrive in the same period they are ordered). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs. I am setting L to default (0), and using a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (averaging ~101) while accounting for the significant volatility (stdev ~13.5 in that window). This should result in a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 15 while maintaining a lean inventory profile consistent with the 1:1 cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P8-P14 confirmed stabilized at avg ~101 units/period; volatility remains significant (std ~13.5).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 8. Analyzing the demand from Period 8 to Period 15 (8 samples), the average demand is approximately 100 units (99.875), which corroborates the carry-over insight of ~101 units. The volatility (sigma) in this period is approximately 13.2. All orders to date have arrived with an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's target base stock will be the median (mean for a normal distribution). Setting N=8 for recent_N captures this stable regime accurately, balancing the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 8-13 against the holding costs incurred when demand dipped slightly in P14-P15.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P8-P16) shows an average demand of approximately 94.3 units, with a notable drop in the most recent period (P16 demand=46). However, previous insights and history suggest a higher sustained average (~101 units). The current on-hand inventory is 54 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout history, so I am maintaining L=0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the demand regime starting from Period 8, which includes the recent stabilization and the latest drop, allowing the OR engine to calculate an appropriate balance of mean and variance (sigma). Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level which is appropriate for balancing stockouts and inventory costs in this scenario.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown a noticeable shift in the last 4 periods (P14-P17) with an average of 70.5 units, which is lower than the previous regime (P8-P13) average of ~102.5 units. The most recent demand values are 85, 89, 46, and 62. The Lead Time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while responding to this recent downward trend, I am using recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand volatility and mean. Given that Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.0 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, which the OR backend will calculate. My goal is to prevent the accumulation of excess inventory seen in P16 and P17 while still being able to meet the lower average demand observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Average demand decreased from ~101 to ~71 (-30%) over the last 4 periods (P14-P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 14. From Period 14 to 18, the observed demand values are 85, 89, 46, 62, and 84. The mean of these last 5 samples is 73.2. Previous insights noted a stabilization around ~71 over P14-P17, and P18's demand (84) slightly lifts that average but maintains the lower-regime trend compared to the earlier ~101 average. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period it is placed). Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At q=0.5, the base stock should roughly equal the median (mean for normal distributions). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and the associated volatility (std ~18 in this regime) while maintaining L at the promised 0.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P14-P19) has shifted to a lower regime compared to the previously observed peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is approximately 74.5 units per period (85, 89, 46, 62, 84, 81), which aligns with the insight from Period 18. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. To avoid over-ordering given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), which suggests a critical ratio of 0.5 (ordering roughly to the median demand), I will use the last 6 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 14) has stabilized at a lower level compared to previous peaks. Demand from P14 to P20 has been: 85, 89, 46, 62, 84, 81, 73. The average for this 7-period window is approximately 74.3 units. This matches the Carry-over Insight from Period 18 which noted a ~30% decrease. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this lower regime and prevent over-ordering, as excess inventory is costly due to the $1.0 holding cost. All historical arrivals have shown a consistent lead time of 0 periods, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 7-period window to capture current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 14. Initially, demand was higher (~101 units/period), but since Period 14, it has cooled. Over the most recent 8 periods (P14-P21), the average demand is approximately 76.9 units. The stockout in Period 21 (demand 95 vs 75 available) suggests that while the mean is lower, volatility remains high (estimated standard deviation for this period is ~15-18). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this current regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), allowing for a more responsive inventory level that accounts for the periodic higher demand spikes while respecting the overall lower average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 stabilized: average demand decreased from ~101 to ~77 units/period over the last 8 periods (P14-P21).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 14. Prior to P14, the average demand was approximately 101 units. Since P14, the average demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, from P14 to P22 (9 samples), the mean demand is 77.67 units with a standard deviation of 15.68. The current state shows zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit, as the order from P22 (77 units) was immediately consumed by the demand in P22 (84 units requested, only 77 sold). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime while maintaining enough sample size for stability. With profit=1 and holding=1, the target service level is 50%, so the OR backend will set the base stock near the mean demand, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift back towards higher levels. While Period 14-21 averaged around 77 units, the last two periods (P22 and P23) saw demand of 84 and 101 units respectively. Carry-over insights confirm a previous regime of ~101 units (P8-P14). Current on-hand is 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the transition and the recent uptick better than a long-term average, while remaining more stable than a 3nd period window. This results in an \u03bc of ~82. (1+0)*82 = 82, which provides a safer base stock given the recent demand of 101. Lead time remains 'calculate' as the 0-period arrival is reliably confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifting upward again: P22-P23 average is 92.5, compared to the P14-P21 average of 77.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift: periods P22-P24 had demands of 84, 101, and 59, averaging 81.33 units. While P23 showed a spike, P24 returned to a lower level (59), suggesting the 'upward shift' noted in the P24 carry-over might be temporary volatility rather than a sustained regime change. The average demand since P14 (the previous regime start) is approximately 78 units. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P14-P24) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while including the recent volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory levels are low (21 on-hand), and since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive this period to meet demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate, but the recent periods (P22-P25) have shown an upward trend compared to the P14-P21 regime. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approximately 81 units (84, 101, 59, 80), though stockouts in P22, P23, and P25 suggest the true demand may be higher. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with setting the base stock to the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift back toward higher demand (approx 81+) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time consistently remains 0 as per history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 81 units/period (P22-P25), ending the previous lower-demand period (P14-P21).

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase. While the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 26 suggested a stabilization around 81 units (based on P22-P25), the demand in Period 26 itself spiked to 106 units. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P22-P26), the mean demand is 86 units, but with high volatility (std ~18). Given the profit/holding cost ratio ($1/$1), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand to minimize total costs. However, because demand frequently exceeds supply (resulting in stockouts in P23, P25, and P26), and the most recent demand was 106, using a short window (N=5) for mu_hat better captures the current upward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Recent 5-period average (P22-P26) increased to 86 units/period, with a significant spike of 106 in P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. While the carry-over insight from Period 27 noted an increase to 86 units/period based on P22-P26, Period 27 demand came in lower at 63. Taking the average of the most recent regime (P22-P27), the mean demand is approximately 82.16 units/period (84, 101, 59, 80, 106, 63). The current on-hand inventory is 23 units with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical data consistently confirms 0-period lead times, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the stabilization of this new regime (starting Period 22) while accounting for the significant volatility observed (ranging from 59 to 106). This period's parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, which implies a target service level close to 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), though the OR backend's inventory cap provides a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-27 stabilized at an average of ~82 units/period, showing high volatility (range 59-106).

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but slightly elevated since Period 22. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P22-P28) is 78.7 units, but the last few Carry-over Insights suggest an upward trend (P22-P27 average was ~82). In the most recent period (P28), demand was lower at 58, but volatility remains a key factor (Range 58-106). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To manage this high-volatility demand environment with equal profit and holding costs ($1), ensuring a robust base stock that covers the lead period (which is effectively only the next period given L=0) is essential. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the regime since P22, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to account for the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift towards a lower, more stable regime compared to the early-period spikes and the mid-period surge. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the average demand is 74 units (80, 106, 63, 58, 63) with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. This replaces the previous higher-demand insight. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 30, I will use a recent_N window of 5 to capture this latest stabilization in demand (avg ~74) and volatility, allowing the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer for the observed variance. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Recent 5-period average (P25-P29) stabilized at ~74 units/period, down from the previous average of ~82.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown several shifts. After a period of higher demand (P22-P26 avg ~86), the context shifted at P25/P26 to a lower regime. The last 6 periods (P25-P30) have an average demand of approximately 76.8 units (80, 106, 63, 58, 63, 91). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P27-P30) average ~68.75. Given the target service level q = 0.5 (since Profit=1 and Holding=1, q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), the OR backend will aim for the median. A recent_N of 6 captures the current regime (P25-P30) balancing the recent low demand with the latest spike of 91. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-30 stabilized at an average of ~77 units/period, following a brief spike in P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 25-31) shows an average demand of approximately 78.6 units per period (samples: 80, 106, 63, 58, 63, 91, 89). While the Carry-over insight for Period 31 noted a stabilization at 77, the most recent values (91, 89) suggest a slight upward trend or continued high volatility around a mean of ~80. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current stockout (on-hand is 0) and the observed volatility, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand shift starting from Period 25. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the latest consumption patterns and standard deviation, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level which is appropriate for equal costs).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-31 stabilized at an average of ~79 units/period with high variance (range 58-106).

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown recent volatility but remains within a recognizable regime since Period 25. The last three periods (P30-P32) have seen demand of 91, 89, and 105, which is higher than the previous low stretch (P27-P29). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 81.8 units. Given the transition from a lower-demand segment to this slightly higher recent activity, and the fact that we have consistently stocked out in the last three periods (sold < demand), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized yet higher average demand level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to reflect the significant volatility (range 58-105) observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-32 stabilized at an average of ~82 units/period, showing a return to higher demand levels compared to the P25-P30 average of 77.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 33 shows a significant drop to 37 units, which is much lower than the previous regime average of ~82. However, single-period fluctuations are common in this data. Looking at the last 9 periods (P25-P33), the average demand is 77.1 units. The most recent 'stable' period identified in carry-over was Period 25. Given the target service level q = 0.5 (since Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0), the base stock should roughly equal the mean demand. The recent downward fluctuation in P33 suggests we should be cautious about over-ordering, but we must maintain enough stock for a potential return to the ~80 range. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the last regime start (P25), which balances the high demand periods (P26, P32) with the low ones (P33). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with high variance. The demand from Period 25 through Period 34 has averaged approximately 76.6 units per period (sample: 80, 106, 63, 58, 63, 91, 89, 105, 37, 71). Although Period 33 was a low outlier (37), Period 34 returned toward the mean (71). We are currently in a regime that started around Period 25. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to reflect the most recent regime's mean and volatility. This helps maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand and variance for the current period, given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend capped policy will provide additional safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-34 stabilized at an average of ~77 units/period with persistent high variance (range 37-106).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~77 units/period since Period 25. Recent demand observations (P33: 37, P34: 71, P35: 41) show a slight downward trend or high variance compared to the previous weeks, but the overall regime remains remarkably stable around the mid-70s to low-80s range. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms 0-period lead times (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 36 units. To maintain an optimal base stock level that accounts for the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (targeting roughly the median of the demand distribution), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (P25 to P35) to capture the current stable regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=11 to reflect the sustained volatility observed in this period (ranging from 37 to 106). This approach ensures we are responsive to the current demand level without overreacting to individual low-demand periods like P33 and P35.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with frequent stockouts (e.g., Period 36). Over the recent regime starting around Period 25, the average demand is approximately 76 units/period (P25-P36). However, the most recent four periods (P33-P36) show a lower average of 56.5 and high variance (range 37-77). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend's base stock calculation (q=0.5) naturally targets by setting the order to the mean of the distribution (z=0). To account for the recent instability and ensure we don't under-order after the recent stockout in P36, I will use a window of the last 12 periods (N=12, from P25 to P36) to capture the current demand regime's mean and variance. This provides a stable estimate of ~76 units/period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been consistently volatile. Recent history (P30-P37) shows demand values of 91, 89, 105, 37, 71, 41, 77, and 69. The average demand over the last 13 periods (since the shift identified in P25) has stabilized at approximately 75 units/period, despite high variance (individual values ranging from 37 to 105). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over the look-ahead period (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat (since Period 25) to capture this stable yet volatile regime. For sigma_hat, I will use the same window to reflect the high local volatility. The promised lead time of 0 is consistent with historical arrivals (all observed lead times are 0), so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime desde P25 has stabilized at an average of ~75 units/period with continued high variance (range 37-105).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 75 units per period since Period 25. Recent demand observations (P34-P38: 71, 41, 77, 69, 70) show a 5-period average of 65.6, but the longer-term regime since P25 (14 periods) is approximately 74.5 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the target service level is 50%, which means the OR engine will target the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat to capture the regime since Period 25, providing a stable mean estimate while accounting for the high fluctuations observed (range 37-105). sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=14 to reflect this volatility correctly in the base stock calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 25. The most recent 15 periods (P25-P39) show an average demand of approximately 75 units, with a standard deviation of about 18.5. Although individual periods fluctuate between 37 and 106, the long-term mean is consistent. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this regime while allowing the OR engine's base-stock calculation to account for the persistent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (14 units), so the OR backend will calculate an order to bring inventory up to the target base stock based on the profit/holding cost ratio (which implies a 50% service level target in this specific case, though the OR cap ensures a higher safety margin).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 25. The most recent data from Period 35 to Period 40 shows demand values of 41, 77, 69, 70, 59, and 88, yielding an average of approximately 67.3 units per period. However, the longer-term regime since P25 averages around 75. Given the high volatility (range 41 to 105 in the last 15 periods), I am using a recent_N approach with N=16 (covering P25-P40) to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, necessitating a full order to meet the (L+1) demand window for Period 41.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a stable regime since roughly Period 25. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P25-P41), the average demand is 73.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. In the most recent 7 periods (P35-P41), the average is slightly lower at 68.5 units. Given that the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the stability and variance of this long-term regime while ensuring enough data points to account for the high volatility (range 37-105) observed in this segment. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during spikes with the cost of holding inventory during drops.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~75 units over the last 18 periods (P25-P42), following a shift from higher demand levels. Specifically, the most recent 10-period average (P33-P42) is 63.6 units, while the 18-period average since the last major regime shift (P25) is 71.3 units. Given the high volatility (sigma is approximately 16.5 over the P25-P42 period), a slightly longer window of N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is selected to capture the stabilized regime while filtering out the noise of individual spikes. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived' messages appearing in the same period they were ordered. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the backend will aim for using the provided parameters. I have 8 units on hand, and 'in-transit' is 0, so the base stock calculation will dictate the next order. I'm choosing N=15 to balance the recent lower demand (63-71 range) with the high variance observed throughout the game.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. The 19-period average (P25-P43) is approximately 73.2 units per period. Recent performance shows frequent minor stockouts (P40, P41, P43) where demand slightly exceeded the starting inventory, suggesting the current order levels are too lean for the high volatility observed (range of 37 to 106). To improve service levels while acknowledging the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), I will use the established regime length of N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the long-term stable mean while accounting for the significant variance that has caused stockouts. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-43 stabilized at an average of ~73 units/period with continued high variance (range 37-106).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 44 (20 samples), the mean is approximately 73.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The observation from Period 44 (demand=71) is consistent with this regime. On-hand inventory is currently very low (2 units), and there are no units in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and history shows actual lead time is consistently 0, the order placed in the current period will arrive and be available for the current period's demand. I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable but high-variance regime since P25. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high variability (std ~17.6) while maintaining a mean of ~73, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost with an implied service level target of 50% ($1/($1+$1)).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 25. The session average since then (P25-P45) is approximately 72.8 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), the average is 70.8 units per period, showing a slight decrease compared to the earlier part of this regime, but remaining within the same general range. The variance remains high (recent demand range 54-88). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message since Period 1. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, targeting a service level (quantile) of 0.50, which means the base stock level should be close to the mean demand. Given the stability over the last 20 periods, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out high-variance spikes.

The core statistics for the most recent regime (P25-P47, 23 periods) show an average demand of 71.91 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.89. Recent demand in the last 3 periods (P45-P47: 54, 59, 75) averages 62.67, slightly lower than the long-term average, but within the expected variance. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable behavior of the current regime while allowing for some sensitivity to recent fluctuations. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. This 0-period lead time means the 'inventory position' only needs to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, roughly corresponding to the mean of the demand distribution. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that effectively targets this mean demand while accounting for the observed volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has remained relatively stable at an average of approximately 73-77 units per period, though it exhibits significant volatility (range 37-106). In the most recent periods (P44-P48), demand has been 71, 54, 59, 75, and 91, resulting in a 5-period average of 70. However, the long-term stabilization point since P25 remains around 73. Given we are at Period 49 (approaching the end of the simulation at P50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover this last stretch without over-ordering excessively, though the holding cost equals profit (critical ratio 0.5), leading the OR engine to naturally target the median. I will use a recent window of 20 periods to capture the current regime's mean and variance while smoothing out the noise from the high-demand spikes (like P32 and P48). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 25. Analyzing the performance over the last 20 periods (P30-P49), the average demand is approximately 71.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. The recent period (P49) saw a lower demand of 45 units, following a higher demand of 91 in P48, consistent with the observed high variance. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held throughout the game history, I will continue to use L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a window of the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture the stable but volatile regime identified since P25, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the inherent demand fluctuations while reflecting the current average volume.
