Historical data for the first five periods shows demand ranging from 61 to 144, with an average of approximately 93 units. Since demand resolution occurs after the decision and arrival phases, and on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the high variance (61 to 144) and a holding cost equal to the profit ($1.0), I need to balance the risk of stockouts against the cost of carrying inventory. I will target the higher end of the historical range to ensure service level in the first period while I establish a baseline for actual lead time and demand patterns.

My current on-hand inventory is 76 units. Since the lead time is 0, the total units available to meet Period 3 demand is 'On-hand (76) + Order placed now'. To cover a potential demand spike (like the P2 sample of 107 or P4 sample of 144) while minimizing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), I need to target a safety level that accounts for the current inventory. If I expect demand to be around 100, I need about 100-110 units total. With 76 on hand, ordering 34 units helps reach a 110-unit buffer.
