This confirms the promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate.\n2. Inventory analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 53 units with 0 units in-transit. Last period (Period 4) demand was 57, and historical demand has fluctuated significantly (61, 107, 84, 144, 69, plus realization from history: 59, 75, 131, 57). \n3. Demand outlook: The mean demand across provided history is approximately 93 units per period. The standard deviation is high (approx 30+). \n4. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 35 units. Let's check the logic: If mean demand is ~93, and we have 53 on-hand, an order of 35 brings total supply to 88. This is slightly below the historical mean. Historically, we had a stockout in Period 3 when demand hit 131. \n5. Strategy: Holding cost is $1.0 and Profit is $1.0. This yields a critical fractile of 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means we should aim to satisfy the median demand. The historical demand data (59, 75, 131, 57, 61, 107, 84, 144, 69) has a median around 75-84.

History confirms that the lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. However, a review of history shows frequent stockouts (Periods 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13) because the demand often exceeds the on-hand inventory + the order placed. The average demand across all 20 historical periods is approximately 88.5 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized between 46 and 84, with Period 20 at 73. The OR recommendation of 72 units, combined with 17 units on hand, provides a total availability of 89 units. Given the historical average (88.5) and the cost structure (where overstocking and understocking are equally penalized), aiming for a total availability around the mean is logical.

Analyzing the game history, the actual lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period.

Historical demand from Period 1 to 22 shows a mean of approximately 88 units, with a standard deviation around 25. The OR recommendation of 84 units is slightly below this mean. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal (critical fractile 0.5), the target inventory level should be the median/mean demand. However, historical volatility suggests that ordering only 84 units after starting with only 5 on-hand (total 89 available) leaves a roughly 50% risk of a stockout. To maintain a slightly safer buffer and minimize lost sales which have occurred frequently (P3, P5, P6, P8, P10, P13, P21), I will adjust the order slightly upward to 95 units.

This means the optimal strategy is for the base-stock to target the median demand of the lookahead window. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, we need to cover only the current period's demand (N=30). Reviewing the historical demand for all 34 samples (5 initial + 29 game periods), the average demand is approximately 85. Recent demand over the last 10 periods (P20-P29) has softened slightly to an average of about 78.4. The OR recommendation is 62 units, calculated using a capped base-stock approach. With current on-hand inventory at 24, ordering 62 units brings the total available for Period 30 to 86 units. This aligns well with the long-term average (85) and provides a slight cushion over the recent average (78), effectively targeting the median while maintaining low holding costs.
