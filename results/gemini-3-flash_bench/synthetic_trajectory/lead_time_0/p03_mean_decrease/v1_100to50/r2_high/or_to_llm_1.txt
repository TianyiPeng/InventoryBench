Using historical samples (mean ~109, std dev ~14), the base stock would be roughly 109 + 1.645*14 \u2248 132. The order would be 132 - 50 = 82.

Starting from Period 4, there was a shift; the average demand for Periods 4-9 is approximately 125 units (samples: 167, 122, 73, 140, 105, 142). Recent demand is particularly strong, with Period 9 at 142 units. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 28. Since L=0, the target is to cover Period 10's demand. Average demand is ~125, but the high variance (ranging from 73 to 167) suggests a need for a buffer.\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 127 units. This corresponds closely to the recent average demand (125). However, given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the critical fractile is very high (~0.95), suggesting we should bias toward higher stock to avoid lost sales.\n5.

Given the recent high-demand periods reaching 146 units, a target around 160-170 is safer to prevent stockouts if demand spikes again, especially since holding costs ($1) are much lower than the profit ($19).

The OR recommendation is 70 units, calculated based on long-term historical averages including the high-demand peaks earlier in the game. Ordering 70 units when demand is currently averaging ~63 units would result in a total supply of 150 units for Period 21. Given the recent downward trend (49 in P19, 46 in P20), 150 units is significantly higher than necessary and would incur high holding costs ($1/unit).\n4. **Final Strategy**: I will override the OR recommendation downward. Since the 0-period lead time allows for responsive same-period inventory adjustments, I want enough stock to cover a potential slight bounce-back in demand without over-ordering.

{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Recent demand (P40-P47) has averaged approximately 48.4 units, though it fluctuates significantly (ranging from 15 to 74). The game ends at Period 50. Analysis: 1) Inventory + incoming order must satisfy Period 48 demand. 2) The OR recommendation of 88 units assumes a base-stock level that accounts for demand variance. 3) Total demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) at a recent average of ~50/period would be 150 units. Starting with 43 on-hand, we need roughly 107 more units to finish the game without stockouts if demand remains at this level. I will follow the OR recommendation of 88 units for this period, which targets a safer stock level given recent volatility, while being mindful that we only have 3 periods remaining.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a recent regime (P35-P48) with an average of approximately 55 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable, as evidenced by Period 48's order arriving in the same period. Since we are entering the penultimate period (Period 49), our objective is to satisfy demand for the final two periods while minimizing ending inventory in Period 50. Currently, we have 59 units on-hand. The OR recommendation is 72 units. Projecting demand at 60 units per period, we need roughly 120 units total for Periods 49 and 50. With 59 units on-hand, an additional 61 units are required. Ordering exactly 61 units targets zero inventory at the game's end, but given the variability (recent demands: 72, 74, 15, 57, 42), I will slightly increase this to 65 units to provide a small buffer against a final demand spike, while still remaining below the OR's capped recommendation of 72 to avoid overstocking in the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize the final total reward at the end of Period 50. Since the game sequence specifies that Period 50 demand is resolved after the current decision phase and arrivals, this is the final opportunity to satisfy demand. Current on-hand inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is 80 units. Reviewing the recent demand history (P45-P49: 57, 15, 74, 72, 44), the 5-period average is approximately 52 units, and the 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 51 units. The highest demand recorded in the last 10 periods was 74 units. With 80 units already on-hand and a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by history to be reliable), the current inventory is sufficient to cover even the high-end of the recent demand range for the final period. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs without increasing revenue, as there are no subsequent periods to sell remaining stock. Therefore, the optimal final action is to order 0 units.",
