The demand seems to be trending slightly downward, but for the first period, I will target a coverage level that accommodates historical averages plus a small buffer. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. Current on-hand is 0. My target inventory level needs to cover Period 1 demand immediately.

With 42 units on-hand, I need to order approximately 80-90 units to meet the next period's demand while maintaining a small buffer.
