The current 'Date' labels (Period_35) don't provide a specific calendar event, so I rely on recent data. We currently have 52 units on-hand. Lead time is confirmed as 0. Since the holding cost is $1.0 and profit is $1.0, the cost of a stockout is roughly equal to the cost of carrying one unit. Given the high volatility (max demand 63-66 in the recent low-regime, and a very low 18 last period), it is prudent to maintain a target inventory roughly matching the high end of recent demand to avoid lost sales, while being mindful of the high holding cost. Target inventory is set at approximately 60. Since on-hand is already 52, I will order a small amount to reach this safety level without over-stocking.",
