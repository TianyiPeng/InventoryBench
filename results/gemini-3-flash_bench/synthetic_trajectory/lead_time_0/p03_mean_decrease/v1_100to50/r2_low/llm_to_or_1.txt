Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with no inventory or in-transit shipments. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods has a mean of 109 and a standard deviation of 14.8. Given the product name and recent downward trend (118, 124, 116, 96, 91), I will use a conservative estimate for demand. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive within the same period. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand (mu_hat). To account for the recent drop in demand from ~120 to ~90, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining enough safety stock via the standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the product 'chips(Regular)' exhibited a demand of 83 units, which is lower than the initial historical data points (average of ~109). The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message (order placed and arrived in P1). Currently, we have 26 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand to balance the risk of stockouts and holding costs. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to weigh the most recent demand samples (P1: 83, and history: 91, 96) which suggest a slight downward trend compared to the earlier history (118, 124, 116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (sold 90 vs demand 108) despite ordering to a base stock level. Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the last two periods (83, 108) averages 95.5, while the initial history provided (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) averaged 109. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 conclusions. Since initial on-hand was 0 and we are facing high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), the backend's default service level (q = 0.5) will target the median demand. To prevent further stockouts while inventory is 0, I will use recent_N to capture the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~101 over all 7 known points) while ensuring the pipeline is filled. I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include both the pre-game samples and the two observed periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the first three periods. Demand has increased from an initial 83 units to over 100 units in the last two periods (108 and 107), resulting in stockouts because the policy didn't account for the current period's demand occurring after the decision. Since we calculate base stock as (1+L) periods of demand, and L=0, we need to cover at least the upcoming period's demand. Average demand over the 3 completed periods is 99.3. However, demand in P2 and P3 averaged 107.5. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher mean and volatility to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 118, 124, 116, 96, and 91 (average: 109). However, previous periods (2, 3, and 4) have consistently run out of stock because the OR backend's order quantities Were restricted by the internal 'cap' or insufficient safety stock parameters, leading to lost sales (demand > sold). In Period 4 specifically, demand spiked to 167 while we only had 100 on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. Given the high variance and recent stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history to stabilize the mean, but I will set L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0 lead time. I am monitoring for a potential downward trend (96, 91), but need more data to confirm if a regime shift is occurring or if it is just noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' has a high critical ratio since profit equals holding cost (q = 0.5, though usually profit is higher, here both are $1.0). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. However, the system has been stocking out every single period from Period 2 to Period 5 because the demand samples provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' (avg ~109) are significantly lower than the actual demand realized in the game history (avg ~117, but spiking to 167 in Period 4). Specifically, the last four periods of realized demand were 108, 107, 167, and 122. The inventory consistently hits zero, indicating lost sales and under-estimation by the OR engine. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher actual demand trend seen in the game history versus the initial samples, and I'll use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in Period 4 (167 vs avg 120). Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual observed demand (Periods 1-5 mean: 117.4) is higher than initial historical samples (mean: 109). Significant demand spike of 167 in Period 4 suggests high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the cumulative demand history (6 periods) plus the initial samples (5 periods) shows an average demand of approximately 109.8 units (Total: 1208 / 11). However, recent performance shows significant stockouts occurring in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 because demand consistently exceeded on-hand inventory. Period 4 was an outlier with 167 units of demand. Period 6 saw a drop to 73, allowing us to build an ending inventory of 45 units for the first time in several periods. Promised Lead Time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (same-day delivery). The carry-over insight correctly notes the mean shift and high volatility. To prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Profit $1 = Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the environment's recent behavior, which averages 110 units per period, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility (std dev ~31) observed during the actual game periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Standard deviation during Periods 1-6 (std ~31) is significantly higher than initial samples; frequent stockouts observed when demand > 110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the stock is consistently sold out or very low, with On-hand inventory currently at 0. Historical demand across Periods 1-7 shows a mean of 114.3 units, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~31). The last four periods (P4-P7) show a higher average demand (125.5) compared to earlier periods, suggesting a potential shift or sustained high-demand regime despite the dip in P6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To better handle the volatility and minimize lost sales (since profit and holding cost are 1:1, meaning we should aim for a 50th percentile service level in a simple model, but the capped policy adds protection), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5 covers the higher demand segment) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. This aims to build a safety buffer to prevent the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher: Period 4-7 average demand (125.5) exceeds initial history. Sustained stockout pattern observed (5 out of 7 periods ended at 0 inventory), indicating mu_hat and sigma_hat need to be more aggressive to meet demand peaks.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 8 completed cycles. Demand has been volatile but shows a sustained higher mean (average demand for Periods 1-8 is 113, but the system has experienced 5 stockouts in 8 periods, indicating our supply parameters are too conservative). The demand in the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) has averaged 121.4, which is notably higher than the initial samples. Due to the high stockout frequency (where sold < demand), the actual mean demand is likely even higher than the observed averages. Given the Profit/Holding ratio of 1:1, the service level q should be 0.5 (z=0), effectively targeting the median. However, to compensate for frequent stockouts and the high variance (std ~30), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, while allowing the lead time to remain at 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high stockout rate (62.5% of periods) confirms that observed demand underrepresents actual demand; the system requires more aggressive mu_hat and sigma_hat settings to stabilize inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to experience a high stockout rate (7 out of 9 periods), with Period 9 ending at 0 inventory despite an order of 105 units. This indicates that actual demand frequently exceeds the current base stock calculated by the OR backend. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-9) is approximately 116.3, but the presence of spikes (167, 142, 140) and frequent stockouts suggests the true demand distribution is shifted higher. Due to the high stockout frequency, the recorded 'sold' units are a floor for 'demand'. To achieve a higher service level and compensate for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which implies a target service level of 50% via the base stock formula q = 1/(1+1)), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to 140 (reflecting recent high-demand periods 7 and 9) and sigma_hat to 35 to capture the high volatility observed (std of demand is roughly 30+). This will force the OR engine to maintain a higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Service level failure: Observed demand is consistently truncated by stockouts in 78% of historical periods. Mean demand of 116 units is a lower bound; explicit parameters must exceed this to stabilize the inventory level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 10, the SKU has experienced stockouts in 8 out of 10 periods (80%). The current mean observed demand of 119.3 is heavily truncated and significantly underrepresents true customer demand, especially given recent peaks of 142 and 146. In Period 10, the system ordered 140 units, all of which were sold immediately, leaving 0 on-hand. To break the cycle of stockouts and establish a safety buffer, mu_hat must be set higher than recent observed maximums. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 160 (covering L+1 where L=0) and sigma_hat to 35 to account for the high volatility (max demand 167) and the high stockout rate. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained service level failure: stockout rate of 80% over 10 periods confirms observed demand is capped by supply. Mean true demand is estimated to be \u2265140 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the stockout cycle was finally broken in Period 11 (ending on-hand: 83), although this was largely due to a dip in demand (77) relative to a high order (160). The 'chips(Regular)' have suffered from chronic stockouts (80% of periods 1-10), meaning historical mean demand is lower than true demand. I've estimated true demand to be \u2265140 based on periods where supply was available to meet it (Period 1, 6, 8, 10, 11). To maintain this progress and prevent a return to zero-inventory, I will set mu_hat to 145 (slightly above the true demand floor) and sigma_hat to 35 (to account for historical volatility like the 167 peak). Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will keep L at default. These aggressive parameters aim to build a small buffer to handle demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Breaking of stockout cycle confirmed in Period 11 with 83 units remaining; however, demand remains volatile (77 unit demand followed 146). The true demand floor is validated at ~140 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system successfully avoided a stockout with an ending inventory of 63 units. This follows Period 11's successful carry-over, indicating we have finally broken the cycle of recurring stockouts where demand was previously truncated by supply. Evaluating the demand history, we see high volatility: Period 10 demand was 146, while Periods 11 and 12 dropped to 77 and 82 respectively. The historical mean of 'sold' units is approximately 107, but this is heavily biased downward by historical stockouts. The true underlying mean across the full period (including the high spikes in P4, P7, P9, P10) is closer to 110-120. However, to maintain a safe service level and given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock should target the mean demand. I will use a mu_hat of 120 (1+L where L=0) and a sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent volatility without over-reacting to the very early stockout periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand was 91 units and the period ended with 29 units on hand. The observed demand over the last several periods (P9-P13) has been 142, 146, 77, 82, and 91, averaging 107.6. However, the period before this (P10) was capped by stockouts, and historical data suggests a higher underlying mean (Period 4 saw 167 demand). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q=0.5). To ensure we don't return to the persistent stockout state seen in Periods 2-10, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window that captures the higher demand regime, while keeping sigma_hat default to maintain responsiveness to volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 14 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, validating the promised lead time. The demand environment for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility and frequent stockouts (Periods 2-5, 7, 9, 10), which suggests that the historical average and 'observed' demand are lower bounds due to supply constraints. While demand has cooled slightly in the most recent 4 periods (\u5e73\u5747 approx 81), the carry-over insights and historical peaks (167, 140, 146) indicate that we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid the high-profit-loss cost of stockouts, especially given the profit/holding cost ratio suggests a 50% service level target (which usually requires at least the mean + some safety stock). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the shift from the high-demand regime (140+) to the current moderate regime, while using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high historical volatility (std ~ 30) that recent small samples might underestimate.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we stocked out again with an ending inventory of 0, selling 103 units while demand was at least 110. This indicates that while the recent demand (Periods 11-15) averaged ~86.4, it still has spikes that exceed our current inventory levels. The 'Regular Chips' category shows moderate volatility but high frequency of stockouts throughout the history. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable. To prevent frequent stockouts and capture the full demand spike potential seen in earlier periods (e.g., 167 in Period 4, 146 in Period 10), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat more aggressively. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current mean, but I am choosing an explicit mu_hat of 125 to provide a buffer over the recent average, and an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for higher volatility than the recent low-demand cluster suggests.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the previous period (Period 16) demand was 82, and we have an ending inventory of 43 with zero in-transit. The history shows a high stockout rate (8 out of 16 periods, or 50%), which indicates that historical 'sold' data underrepresents true demand. However, recent periods (11-16) have shown more stability with fewer stockouts, though Period 15 did hit zero again. The average demand across all historical samples (including pre-game) is approximately 110, but the periods without stockouts suggest a higher variance. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a service level of 50%, which is too low given the high penalty of stockouts (lost sales). To maintain a safer buffer and prevent the frequent stockouts seen earlier while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat slightly above the historical median and using a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the actual volatility of the last 6 periods (Phase after the high stockout cycle). L remains at the promised 0 as observed in every conclusive period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 48 units on-hand and an actual lead time of 0. Reviewing recent history, demand has cooled slightly from the high highs (Periods 11-17 mean is approx 83), which contrasts with the earlier sustained stockout phase (Periods 1-10) where demand often exceeded supply. However, the profit/holding cost ratio ($1/$1) implies an optimal service level of 50%, meaning the OR backend aims for the median. To prevent falling back into the stockout cycle observed earlier, I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=7) to capture the current lower demand regime (~83 units) while maintaining a high sigma_hat (standard deviation of the same window is ~15) to cover potential volatility. I'll use explicit sigma to ensure we don't under-order if the backend's default calculation is too conservative for this volatile SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~83 units) compared to the initial high-intensity period, though volatility remains present.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 8 periods (Period 11-18), the demand regime has shifted to a lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. The average demand during this period is approximately 81.3 units (77, 82, 91, 72, 110, 82, 67, 70). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Despite the lower mean, demand remains somewhat volatile, with a standard deviation around 15-20 units. I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to reduce holding costs (since profit equals holding cost, q=0.5) with enough inventory to cover the observed volatility in this new regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0. The demand regime has clearly shifted to a lower level since Period 11, with an average of approximately 78 units over the last 9 periods (P11-P19). Recent demand (Period 19) was even lower at 49 units, but to avoid under-stocking due to potential volatility, I will use a window (recent_N=9) that covers the entire modern regime. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR target service level is q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. Since we want to balance the cost of holding inventory (which has been accumulating recently: 33 units on-hand) against the risk of stockouts seen in the early game, utilizing a recent window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is the most responsive strategy to the current lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized at the lower mean (~78 units) observed since Period 11, contrasting sharply with the early-game average of ~115+ units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial high-demand period (Periods 1-10). Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), mean demand is 74.6 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show an even lower average of 55 units. However, I want to avoid over-reacting to a very small window of extremely low demand (46, 49 units) to prevent stockouts if demand reverts to the 70-80 range. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime (74.6 mean). For sigma_hat, N=10 will account for the moderate volatility seen in this period (std ~ 17.5). Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further since Period 18: recent 3-period mean (P18-P20) is 55 units, significantly below the post-P11 average of ~75 units. Monitoring for a sustained downward shift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly downwards since Period 18. Analysis of the most recent data (Periods 18-21) shows demand levels of 70, 49, 46, and 40 units respectively, with an average of 51.25 units. This is a clear departure from the Period 11-17 average (~83 units). The previous Period 21 carry-over insight noted a 3-period mean of 55, and the latest data point (40) confirms this downward trend. To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs in this lower-demand environment, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the new, lower local mean and variance while discarding the older high-demand noise. The lead time remains consistently at 0, so I will continue to use the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Period 18-21 mean is 51.3 units, compared to ~83 units previously. Variance has also decreased significantly in this window.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand phase. Analyzing the most recent period (P18-P22), the demand has been: 70, 49, 46, 40, 51. This results in a 5-period mean of 51.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 11.3. The system is currently holding 1 unit on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this specific low-demand regime. This provides a base_stock target around 51-60 units (depending on the OR engine's service level calculation), which balances the very low holding cost/profit ratio (1:1) with the need to prevent stockouts in this now more predictable demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the early-game average. Since Period 18, demand has consistently stayed below 70 units, with a mean of 49.8 units over the last 6 periods (P18-P23: 70, 49, 46, 40, 51, 43). This confirms the downshift noted in previous carry-over insights. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the current on-hand inventory of 9 units and the lower demand profile, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this new, lower-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility in this window, ensuring we balance service levels without incurring excessive holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower mean: P18-P23 mean is 49.8 units (compared to P11-P17 mean of 86.3 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has demonstrably shifted downwards since Period 18. Comparing the initial high-demand phase (P1-P10 mean: ~117) to the previous mid-game phase (P11-P17 mean: ~86) and the current phase (P18-P24 mean: 48.8), there is a clear stabilization at a lower level. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P18-P24) show demands of 70, 49, 46, 40, 51, 43, and 33. The average for this most recent regime is 47.4 units per period with a significantly lower standard deviation compared to earlier periods. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we aim for the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to focus on this current stabilized lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 18-24 mean is 48.8 units, confirming a sustained lower demand level compared to all previous periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower demand regime starting around Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 18 to Period 25 (last 8 samples) is approximately 46.5 units, with significantly lower volatility compared to the early game. Earlier analysis showed mean demand levels over 115 units, but the current context reflects a sustained downshift. In Period 25, demand was 33 units, following values of 33, 43, 51, 40, and 46. Given the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, and the profit margin ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5. This means the engine should target the median demand (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat) to minimize total cost. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this lower regime effectively while providing enough data points for the OR engine's statistical calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system stocked out with a demand of 49 and an ending inventory of 0 units, indicating that the previous parameters for mu_hat (estimated around 48.8 units) were slightly too conservative for recent volatility. The demand in Period 26 (49 units) represents a return to the upper end of the current regime (Periods 18-26 mean: 48.2 units). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. To prevent recurring stockouts while demand remains centered around 48-50 units, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the stable regime starting from Period 18) to capture the mean and standard deviation of this lower-demand period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains significantly lower than the early periods of the game. Since Period 18, demand has averaged approximately 46.5 units per period. The 10-period average (P18-P27) is 46.8, and the most recent 5-period average (P23-P27) is 42.4 units, though the last two periods showed a slight uptick (49 and 54) leading to stockouts because the OR backend's cap was too restrictive for these peaks. Given Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). However, consecutive stockouts in P26 and P27 indicate we need to slightly elevate the safety buffer to account for the recent variance. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current low-demand regime while including enough samples to estimate variance properly. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 18 to Period 28 is approximately 45.4 units. Although we saw a small spike with a stockout in Period 27 (demand=54), the overall trend remains significantly lower than the early-game average. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime and avoid over-ordering given the equal cost weighting (Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized demand since Period 18. This will provide a balanced estimate of the mean and volatility for this lower-demand segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Periods 18-28 with a mean of ~45 units and significantly lower volatility compared to P1-P17. Stockout in P27 was an outlier within this lower regime, not a shift back to high demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has remained stable at a significantly lower level than the early periods of the game. For the interval P18-P29, the mean demand is approximately 46.3 units. In Period 29, we observed a minor stockout (46 sold vs 56 demand), suggesting that while the demand has downshifted, volatility or small spikes still occur. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level while minimizing holding costs in this new regime, I will continue to use a recent_N strategy (N=12, covering P18-P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower mean and reduced (but present) variance. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level since Period 18. Analysis of the recent 13-period window (P18-P30) shows an average demand of approximately 44.4 units per period. The last five periods (P26-P30) show a mean of 42.4 units, though individual periods continue to exhibit moderate volatility (ranging from 22 to 56). The stockout at Period 29 was caused by demand (56) exceeding the inventory available at that transition, but Period 30's low demand (22) resulted in 25 units of carry-over stock. Given stable lead times (0 periods confirmed consistently), I am using a recent_N approach with N=13 to capture the entirety of this lower-demand regime while providing enough samples to stabilize the sigma_hat against the observed volatility. This sets the base stock level to cover the (L+1) period demand (~45 units) plus a safety buffer.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has remained consistently lower (average ~45-50 units) compared to earlier periods. However, recent volatility is observed: Period 31 saw a spike to 70 units, causing a stockout from a starting on-hand inventory of 45. Period 30 was low at 22 units. Since the target service level (q) is 0.5 (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0), the base stock should ideally target the median demand. A recent_N window for the period since the last major regime shift (P18 onwards, N=14) provides a reliable mean and variance estimate. I will use recent_N=14 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility seen in Period 31. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the early game, with a mean around 45 units. However, recent periods (P29, P31) have shown slight volatility with spikes (up to 70 units), which triggered stockouts because my previous targets were lean. The current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better balance the high cost of stocking out (opportunity cost and inventory reset) against holding costs, I am selecting a recent_N of 15 periods (starting from P18). This captures the entire low-demand regime while including the recent volatility. This allows mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual mean (~45) and the recent variance, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against occasional spikes in this 'new normal' regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 18 at a much lower level than the start of the game. For the recent window of Periods 18\u201333, the mean demand is approximately 45.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9 units. There was a recent spike in Period 31 (demand=70) that caused a stockout, but subsequent demand returned to the mean (46 and 31). Given the current on-hand inventory of 16 units and a promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently 0 in practice), I will use the recent_N method based on the 16-period stable regime (starting P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower average demand with the observed volatility (spikes like P31) to maintain a sufficient service level without excessive holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime since Period 18 has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the early periods (P1-P17). Over the last 17 periods (P18-P34), the mean demand has been approximately 44 units. However, there is still notable volatility (range 22 to 70). The most recent demand (Period 34) was 25, follows a general lower-bound pattern. I am selecting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific post-shift regime starting at Period 18, while excluding the high-demand data from the first third of the game. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by 'arrived' messages every period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower-intensity phase identified around Period 18. Specifically, from Period 18 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 45.6 units. However, volatility persists, with recent peaks such as 70 units in Period 31 and 55 units in Period 35 causing stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 0 units in-transit, meaning the system is starting from scratch to meet Period 36 demand. To prevent recurring stockouts while acknowledging the lower mean, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (covering the entire low-demand regime since P18) to stabilize both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has remained consistently lower (mean ~45-50) compared to the start of the game. However, recent periods (P31, P35, P36) show recurring demand spikes (70, 55, 61) that have caused stockouts even within this lower regime. The stockout in Period 36 (sold 45 out of 61 demand) indicates that the safety stock is slightly too low to absorb these localized peaks. I will use a recent_N window of 19 (P18-P36) to capture the lower regime's mean while adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat slightly more aggressively to prevent these recurring stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes within the lower regime (P31: 70, P35: 55, P36: 61) are causing frequent service level failures, suggesting that volatility in the current 45-50 mean regime is higher than previously estimated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift in volatility. Since Period 31, we've observed more frequent demand spikes (70, 55, 61, 63) compared to the Period 18-30 mean of ~45. These spikes have resulted in stockouts in Periods 31, 35, 36, and 37 because the base stock was not sufficient to cover the right tail of the demand distribution. The actual lead time remains 0. To stabilize the service level, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current mean (approx 50.1 units) and 'recent_N' with N=20 for sigma_hat to better reflect the underlying volatility observed in the second half of the game. Using a larger N for sigma_hat ensures the OR engine accounts for those significant spikes while the shorter N for mu_hat tracks the current regime mean.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility regime within the lower-mean segment: Demand spikes of >60 units are now occurring frequently (Periods 36-37), causing consistent stockouts and indicating that sigma_hat needs to remain elevated despite the lower overall mean demand of ~50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a lower-mean state (stabilized around ~50 units since Period 18) but is currently experiencing a significant surge in both volume and volatility. In the last three periods (P36-P38), demand has been 61, 63, and 83, leading to three consecutive stockouts. The Period 38 demand of 83 is the highest observed since Period 16. This suggests that while the long-term mean is lower, we are in a 'high-volatility spike' sub-regime. To address this and prevent further stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' of 10 to capture the recent trend including the spikes (P29-P38 mean \u2248 51.2), but because the last three periods average ~69, I will use 'explicit' to set a higher base stock. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, targeting the median. However, repeated stockouts indicate we are under-forecasting. I will set mu_hat to 80 (reflecting the recent peak) and increase the sigma_hat estimate to 20 to handle the observed variance (range of 22 to 83 in the last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sub-regime confirmed: Periods 36-38 show a significant upward trend (61, 63, 83) within the lower-mean regime, resulting in a 100% stockout rate over those periods. Current demand is trending back toward early-game levels (~80+ units).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the recent demand spike sub-regime (P36-P38 mean: 69) corrected itself with a significantly lower demand of 44. This suggests that while there is an upward trend or higher volatility compared to the P18-P28 mean of ~45, it has not returned to the triple-digit levels of the early game. The current demand mean over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 61.2 with a standard deviation of ~14.4. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent five-period window (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility and recent mean shift, while maintaining a default lead time of 0 as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated within the lower-mean regime: P35-P39 mean is 61.2 units, significantly higher than the P18-P34 mean of ~46 units, though lower than early-game levels of >115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we experienced another stockout (ending inventory 0), with demand (63) exceeding starting inventory (62). This confirms the demand volatility noted in recent carry-over insights. The mean demand for the most recent 10-period window (P31-P40) is 58.1 units, which is significantly higher than the ~46 units seen in the P18-P30 window. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) have a mean of 58.8 and include a peak of 83. Given the Lead Time (L=0) and the high stockout rate (7 of the last 10 periods ended at 0 or 1 unit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5. This allows the OR engine to react to this recent high-volatility, higher-mean sub-regime (approx 60 units/period) while maintaining a buffer for spikes, addressing the current service level instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sub-shift at Period 35: Mean demand has increased to approximately 60 units (P35-P40 mean: 58.2), up from the previous regime mean of ~45. This shift is accompanied by high volatility and frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 35, moving from a mean of ~45 to a new levels characterized by spikes and high volatility. Recent demand (P35-P41) averages 58.1 units but is frequently truncated by stockouts (shown in P35-P38 and P40), indicating that the true latent demand is likely higher (~65-70 units). Period 41 saw a drop to 36 units, but given the volatility, this is likely noise within the higher-demand regime rather than a downward shift. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-P35 volatility and shift. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrive in same period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35, moving from a mean of ~45 to a higher, more volatile mean. For the most recent 8 periods (P35-P42), the demand mean is approximately 57 units (55, 61, 63, 83, 44, 63, 36, 59), but several periods resulted in stockouts (P35, P36, P37, P38, P40, P42), meaning true demand is likely higher. In Period 42, we stocked out again (demand 59, sold 58), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Given the lead time is 0, we need our base stock to cover the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated volatility and higher mean while acknowledging the stockout truncation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sub-shift at Period 35 continues to show high volatility and a higher mean (~60+) compared to the P18-P34 period. Frequent stockouts (6 out of last 8 periods) indicate the mean demand is likely >60.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized at a higher level than the P18-P34 period, with a mean of approximately 58 units (P35-P43 mean: 58.6) and continued high volatility. In Period 43, demand was 48, with an ending inventory of 10. While this was not a stockout, the frequency of stockouts in the current regime (6 out of the last 9 periods) suggests that the underlying demand often exceeds the on-hand inventory. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given Profit = Holding Cost = $1.0), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P35-P43) to specifically capture this current sub-regime's behavior. This N=9 window balance the need for recent accuracy with enough data to estimate the elevated variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35, moving from a mean of ~45 to a higher, more volatile state. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), demand has averaged 57.4 units with several spikes exceeding 60 units (reaching as high as 83). The stockout rate remains high (60% since P35), indicating that the true mean is likely slightly higher than the observed average due to censored demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this active 'higher-than-previous' regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for the heightened volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. These parameters aim to increase safety stock to prevent further service level failures during the final periods of the game.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a sub-regime starting around Period 35, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 55-60 units but with high volatility (spikes up to 83 units). Recent periods (P41-P45) show a mean of 48.4 with a stockout in P45, suggesting that the actual demand is slightly higher than the sold units. Since Period 40, the on-hand inventory has frequently hit zero, indicating that the OR parameters need to be slightly more aggressive to maintain a sufficient service level. I will use a recent_N of 11 (covering Periods 35-45) to capture the current volatility and mean of this specific sub-regime, as using an EWMA or a shorter window might over-react to the slightly lower demand in the last three periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 35 confirmed at mean ~58 with high volatility; frequent stockouts suggest the recorded demand remains a lower bound for actual need.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a sub-regime starting around Period 35, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 55-60 units with recurring spikes and high stockout frequency. While Period 46 saw a significant dip (demand = 15), this appears to be an outlier on the lower end, much like previous spikes were outliers on the higher end. The average demand from Period 35 to Period 46 is 50.8 units, but given the high stockout rate (demand often exceeding available supply in 7 of the last 12 periods), the true mean is likely higher. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this entire sub-regime (P35-P46) which provides a more robust estimate of current volatility than the long-term history. L remains 0 as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set to the same N=12 to account for the high volatility observed in this period, ensuring we have enough safety stock to cover demand spikes like the 83 units seen in Period 38.

Daily Profit: $53.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 58 units (P35-P47 mean: 58.5) and high volatility (standard deviation ~17.8), frequently exceeding 60-70 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Period 47 conclude shows a demand of 74 units, which resulted in another stockout. To prevent stockouts in these final periods (48-50), I am setting mu_hat to 65 (slightly above the recent average) and sigma_hat to 20 to account for the frequent observed spikes (74, 83). This ensures a higher base stock to cover the volatility while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a more volatile regime since Period 35, with mean demand fluctuating around 60 units. Most recently, Periods 47 and 48 saw demand spikes of 74 and 72 units respectively, both of which resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand: 0). Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, and the promised lead time is 0, an order placed now will arrive this period to satisfy Period 49 demand. To maximize profit and prevent a third consecutive stockout, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the regime since Period 35) to capture the higher mean and volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with the same N to account for the frequent spikes. This ensures a higher base stock level for this penultimate period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the final phase: Period 47-48 demand spikes (74, 72) confirmed that mean demand is currently \u2265 60 units and the system remains prone to stockouts if inventory is not aggressively maintained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. The current demand regime (since Period 35) is characterized by a mean demand of approximately 58 units with high volatility (spikes >70). The recent 5 periods (P45-P49) show a mean of 62.2, confirming that demand remains elevated despite fluctuations. In P49, demand was 44 and sales were 44, leaving an on-hand inventory of 12 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Since this is the final period, the goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing inventory left at the end of the game. I will use the recent 15-period windows for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the higher mean and volatility observed since the Period 35 sub-shift, ensuring we cover a potential spike in the final step.
