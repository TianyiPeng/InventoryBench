Initial historical data provided for Periods 1-5 (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) shows an average demand of approximately 109 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand in this same period. However, since the system execution order places my decision before arrival and demand resolution, I need to ensure I order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the average of 109 and the first historical sample of 118, I will target a slightly higher inventory level to avoid stockouts in the first period, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0.

Since the Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal strategy is to maintain lean inventory to avoid high holding costs while still covering expected demand. I will target an available inventory of 50 units (slightly above the recent 42-unit average) to account for volatility while minimizing excess.
