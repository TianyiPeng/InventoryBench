The average demand across all five historical samples is approximately 145 units, but the Period 1 sample specifically is 216. Given the 0-period lead time, I must order enough to cover the immediate demand of this period (N=1). I will target the historical Period 1 value (216) plus a small buffer to account for variance and ensure I don't stock out on day one. Total target: 230 units.
