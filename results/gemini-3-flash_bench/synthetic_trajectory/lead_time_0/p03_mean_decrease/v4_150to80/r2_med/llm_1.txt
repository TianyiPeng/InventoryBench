Based on the historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the average demand is approximately 145 units per period. However, Period 1 showed a significantly higher demand (216) compared to the subsequent periods (stabilizing around 120-130). I will use a conservative forecast of approximately 140 units to account for potential variability. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. My inventory is currently 0. To maximize reward while minimizing stockout risk, I will order enough to cover Period 1 demand plus a small buffer, as I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit.",

Last period resulted in 45 units of lost sales (demand 195 vs. 150 sold). e) Order Logic: To avoid lost sales and cover the higher end of the demand spectrum (approx 200 units), I will order 210 units.
