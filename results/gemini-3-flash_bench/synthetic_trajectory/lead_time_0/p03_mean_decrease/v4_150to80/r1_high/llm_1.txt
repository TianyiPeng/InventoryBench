The historical samples for 'chips(Regular)' show demand of [216, 129, 138, 129, 115]. The first period (216) appears as an outlier or initial surge, while the subsequent four periods settle into a regime averaging 127.75 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 1 and be available for the demand resolution phase of the same period (L+1 coverage needed). Given the profit margin ($19) vs. holding cost ($1) is high, the cost of a stockout is significantly higher than holding inventory. I will target the high end of the stable demand regime (approx 140) plus a safety buffer to account for the possibility of higher demand closer to the Period 1 historical record (216), aiming for roughly 160 units to balance service level and initial uncertainty.",
