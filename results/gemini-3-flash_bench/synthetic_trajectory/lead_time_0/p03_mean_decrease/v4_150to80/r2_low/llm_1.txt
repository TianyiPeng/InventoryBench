Based on the historical demand samples provided (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the average demand is approximately 145 units. However, there was a high initial spike of 216 in the first sample.

To target a safe inventory level for the upcoming periods and minimize stockout risk while balancing high holding costs ($1/unit), I aim to have enough stock to cover roughly 1.5 periods of demand.

Based on the observed history and lead time of 0 periods (confirmed across multiple cycles), the order arrives and is available for sale in the same period it is placed. We are currently in a high-variance demand regime that started around Period 24. Average demand in this current regime (P24-P33) is approximately 95 units, but with a high standard deviation (range 59 to 144). The last three demand points were 144, 108, and 78, showing significant fluctuation. Since profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (Newsvendor P = Cu / (Cu + Co) = 1/(1+1)). This suggests targeting the median demand of the current regime. The median of the P24-P33 sequence (102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59, 144, 108, 78) is 97.5. Considering the high variance, I will target a slightly higher stock level than the mean to avoid lost sales, but remain cautious due to the high holding cost. Target inventory for Period 34 is 120 units. Current on-hand is 57. Required order = 120 - 57 = 63.",
