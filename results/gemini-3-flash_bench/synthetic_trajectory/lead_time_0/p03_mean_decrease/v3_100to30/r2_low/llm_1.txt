Since profit equals holding cost, the optimal service level is 50% (Newsvendor logic: P/(P+H) = 0.5), though for a vending SKU with no lead time (promised L=0), we should aim to cover the current period's demand without overstocking significantly. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged 92.2 units (109, 68, 99, 80, 105). Given that I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, and the arrival happens in the same period (L=0), I need to place an order immediately. I will order 95 units to cover the expected demand based on the historical average, adjusting slightly upward from the mean to account for the initial zero-inventory state while remaining cautious of the equal holding cost.",

Recent demand in Period 16 dropped significantly to 15, while Period 14 saw a high of 163. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 95 units. To maximize reward, I must balance the high potential for stockouts (costing $1 per unit in lost profit) against the high holding cost ($1 per unit). Given that demand frequently exceeds 100 units, I aim for a target inventory level around 110-115 for the upcoming period. Since I already have 95 units on hand, and current demand is highly volatile, ordering 20 units will bring the total availability to 115, which covers the historical average and provides a buffer against spikes without excessive holding costs if demand remains low like in Period 16.",
