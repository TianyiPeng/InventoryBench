Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) for chips(Regular) show values of 109, 68, 99, 80, and 105, which averages to approximately 92 units per period with significant variance. Since demand resolution occurs after the decision phase and I currently have 0 on-hand inventory, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the high profitability ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the cost of a stockout is much higher than the cost of holding inventory. I will target a slightly higher-than-average quantity to account for the variance observed in the sample data (range 68-109) and ensure I don't miss the first period's sales.

The established lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 17's demand. My current on-hand inventory is 96 units. Given the high profit ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the penalty for stocking out is high. To maintain a high service level while accounting for potential demand spikes (historical max ~149), I target a total available inventory (On-hand + Current Order) of approximately 140-150 units.

Harris (Regular) chips currently show a complex demand profile. After a significant cooling period (Periods 36-40, avg ~15), demand has entered a higher-volatility regime starting in Period 41. The last 6 periods (P41-P46) have shown demands of 51, 32, 35, 53, 19, and 23, resulting in a mean of 35.5 and a high standard deviation (approx 14).

Lead time is reliably confirmed as 0 periods. Therefore, inventory levels for the current period depend entirely on the order placed now (Order_N + On-hand = Total available for Period N demand).

Given the recent volatility and the risk of spikes (reaching 53 twice in the last 6 periods), a target stock level of approximately 55-60 units is advisable. This coverage respects the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio (recommending a higher service level) while acknowledging the game is nearing its end (Period 47 of 50). 

On-hand inventory is 32 units. To reach a safety-adjusted target of 55 units, an order of 23 is required.
