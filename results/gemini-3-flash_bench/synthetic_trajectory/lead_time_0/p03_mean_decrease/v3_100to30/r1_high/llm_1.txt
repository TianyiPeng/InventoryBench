There is moderate variance, but no clear trend yet. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1's demand. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently at 0 inventory. e) Logic: I need to cover the expected demand for Period 1 immediately. Given the average demand is ~92 and the range is 68-109, I will order 110 units to ensure high service level for the first period while minimizing stockout risk, especially since I start with zero on-hand.",
