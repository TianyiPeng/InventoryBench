Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead-time data yet. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the initial demand samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), the average demand is 92.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.5. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a 1-period look-ahead requirement (L+1), I will use the 'default' methods which will calculate parameters based on the full history of samples. Given the promised lead time L=0, the backend will target a base stock level that covers one period of demand (Period 1 itself).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 146 units, which significantly exceeded the historical average (~92) and the initial order. Despite the promised lead time being 0, and the order arriving in the same period, we stocked out. For Period 2, I need to account for this higher demand level. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods. Since we have very few historical samples (6 total, including Period 1's high demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent spike more heavily while still considering the recent history. This should increase the base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we stocked out because demand (146) exceeded our order (107). In Period 2, demand dropped to 81, leaving us with 44 units on hand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The mean demand over these first two periods is 113.5 with a high standard deviation (approx 46). Given the short 5-period sample history provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), the average demand is 92.2. However, the last two periods' realized demand (146 and 81) suggests volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full provided sample history and reconcile with the observed variance. Since lead time is stable at 0, I will use 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand samples are [146, 81, 108], with a mean of 111.6. Although the provided historical demand context (Periods 1-5 from instructions) suggested slightly lower values, I must prioritize the live game history which shows actual demand from Period 1-3. The current on-hand inventory is 17. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current game's demand behavior. This will set the base stock level to cover current Period 4 demand (which arrives instantly when L=0).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived in their respective periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 146, 81, 108, and 72 (Mean = 101.75). The concluding messages for Periods 1 through 4 confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, ensuring orders arrive in the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 68 units. The OR backend uses a (1+L) period demand horizon, which currently means targeting one period ahead (Period 5). Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows for a more responsive inventory target, reflecting the variability observed in the small sample set (N=4). The profit-to-holding ratio is high ($4 vs $1), favoring a higher service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 periods. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (arriving within the same period as ordered). The demand history (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) shows a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Although the 'conclude' messages show different demand values (146, 81, 108, 72, 69) due to stockout constraints in Period 1 and resolution logic, the underlying demand samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) are more reliable for forecasting. Recent demand (last 2 periods) appears slightly lower than the initial spike, but the overall average remains stable around 92. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the 0 lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 92 units for the upcoming period while accounting for the ~17.5 unit volatility and the remaining 61 units on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed across Periods 1-6). Demand for the first 6 periods has been 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74. There appears to be a slight downward shift in demand volume starting from Period 4, where demand stabilized around a mean of ~71.7 units compared to the earlier periods. Given this, I will use a N=3 window for the recent demand regime (Periods 4, 5, 6) to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the observed 0-period lead time. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (4/(4+1)), which these parameters will help the OR engine achieve while minimizing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean demand decreased from ~111 (P1-P3) to ~72 (P4-P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory ran out (sold 74 out of 98 demand), resulting in 0 on-hand inventory for Period 8. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders within the same period (P1-P7). Regarding demand, a previous insight noted a shift to a lower mean starting at P4 (~72); however, Period 7 showed a jump back to 98. Looking at the history (P1: 146, P2: 81, P3: 108, P4: 72, P5: 69, P6: 74, P7: 98), there is significant volatility. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent four periods (P4-P7) which average ~78.25, slightly adjusting for the recent uptick while acknowledging the lower regime. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect recent variance. Since on-hand is 0, the base stock calculation must ensure enough is ordered to meet Period 8's demand.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed through Period 8). The demand history shows a shift around Period 4. Looking at recent data: Period 4 (72), Period 5 (69), Period 6 (74), Period 7 (98), and Period 8 (86). The mean of these last five periods is approximately 80. While there was a previous insight suggesting a drop to ~72, the last two periods (98 and 86) suggest the mean is slightly higher or volatile. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Periods 4-8) while excluding the higher start (Period 1-3). Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents the demand for (0+1) which is exactly the next period's forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized around 80 units since Period 4 (Periods 4-8 average: 79.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that demand has been slightly higher in the most recent periods (P7-P9 average: 96.3) compared to the stable period previously identified (P4-P8 average: ~80). Specifically, P7 demand was 98 and P9 was 105, which led to stockouts. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods based on the history of all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. To prevent recurring stockouts while accounting for the recent increase in demand and volatility, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (P4-P9), which captures the shift away from the initial high demand of P1-P3 but includes the recent upward pressure. This period (P4-P9) has a mean of ~84 and a standard deviation of ~14. Given the Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1 (z-score approximately 0.84), a base stock covering this demand plus some safety stock is necessary. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 ensures the OR backend uses this more relevant data regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased recently (P7-P9), leading to stockouts at a mean demand of ~80; actual demand mean for P4-P9 is 84.0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 4 periods (P7-P10), demand has consistently exceeded the supply provided by the base stock logic, resulting in stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in 3 of the last 4 periods). The average demand from Period 4 to Period 10 is 86.2 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P7-P10) average 97.2 units, indicating a possible second regime shift upward or increased volatility that is not being captured by the long-term mean. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since the L=0 environment reacts within the same period, I will increase the demand forecast (mu_hat) by using recent_N (N=4) to capture this recent climb to ~97 units. I will also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility observed since Period 4, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to prevent the repeated stockouts seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~72 (P4-P6) to ~97 (P7-P10), resulting in frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 7 to Period 11 shows a clear regime shift compared to Periods 4-6. The average demand for this most recent period (P7-P11) is 100.4 units (98, 86, 105, 100, 113), which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~72. Additionally, we have experienced four stockouts in the last five periods (P7, P9, P10, P11), indicating that our inventory levels are consistently falling short of actual demand. Given the stockout constraints (sold units < demand units), the true underlying demand is likely even higher than the recorded mean of 100.4. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To address this, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current period's volatility. This should increase the base stock level to prevent further stockouts while maintaining a 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: Mean demand increased from ~72 to ~100.4 (+39%), resulting in stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift around Period 7. While the mean demand for Periods 4-6 was ~72, the mean demand from Periods 7-12 has increased significantly to approximately 97.5 (calculated from 98, 86, 105, 100, 113, 83). Despite a lower demand of 83 in Period 12, the overall trend since Period 7 justifies focusing on the last 6 periods to set a more responsive base stock. Frequent stockouts in Periods 7, 9, 10, and 11 indicate that the previous estimates were too conservative. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all concluding messages. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while ignoring the lower demand seen in the P4-P6 stretch.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 7 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~72 (P4-P6) to ~97.5 (P7-P12), though P12 saw a slight dip to 83.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 13, demand has averaged approximately 95.7 units per period, compared to the lower mean of ~72 seen from Periods 4-6. Although the last two periods (P12 and P13) show lower demand values (83 and 84), these followed a string of stockouts and high demand values (98, 86, 105, 100, 113). Therefore, I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods (Periods 7-13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this higher-demand regime while incorporating the recent moderation. The lead time L is consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching the same-period arrival resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we experienced a massive demand spike (163 units) which resulted in a stockout (sold 106, on-hand 0). This suggests the demand regime is no longer stable around ~97 units and has shifted significantly higher or is experiencing high-impact volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since Period 7, mean demand was approximately 104 units (including the P14 spike), but the last couple of periods (P11-P14) show a much higher average of ~111 units. To recover from this stockout and protect against this heightened demand, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the shift since P7, but I will uses an explicit sigma_hat. Given the standard deviation for the entire P7-P14 period is approximately 25, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to add a safety buffer for the high variance observed in Period 14 (163 units).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility/spike detected at Period 14: demand reached 163 units, causing a stockout. Period 7-14 mean is now ~104 units, but variance has increased sharply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. Analyzing the demand for chips(Regular), there have been distinct regimes: P1-P3 (mean ~112), P4-P6 (mean ~72), and P7-P15 (mean ~100.2). Specifically, since Period 7, the average demand has been 100.2, but it is highly volatile, with recent peaks like Period 14 (163 units) and dips like Period 15 (69 units). The inventory at Period 16 start is 61. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility in the current regime (P7-P15) and a stockout caused by a spike in Period 14, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 9 periods (the current regime length) to capture the higher mean of ~100. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the increased variance, which helps the OR backend set a higher safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P7, P9, P10, P11, and P14.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (Period 7-15) shows a mean of 100.2 units with high volatility (range 69-163), replacing the lower stable mean observed in P4-P6.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand was unusually low at 15 units, contrasting sharply with the Period 14 spike (163 units) and the general regime mean established since Period 7 (~100 units). The current on-hand inventory is 108 units. Given the high volatility observed recently (standard deviation of ~40 units in the P7-P16 regime), a 15-unit observation is likely an outlier on the low end rather than a permanent downward shift in the mean. However, because it significantly impacts the recent average, I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat to include the full range of the current volatile regime (P7-P16). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that handles the high variance while accounting for the high levels of current on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand volatility significantly increased starting P7; demand range observed is 15-163 units within the same regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility. Period 14 saw a peak of 163 units, while Periods 16 and 17 dropped significantly to 15 and 24 units respectively. Since the regime shift in Period 7, the average demand is approximately 86 units, but the high variance makes a standard mean calculation risky. The target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80 suggests a base stock that covers the 80th percentile of anticipated demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 99 units and the recent low demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 (tracking from the start of the current volatile regime at Period 7) to capture both the spikes and the recent dips. The lead time is confirmed as 0 via 'calculate'. This approach will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that balances the risk of a return to high demand against the current high holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; the mean demand for the Period 7-17 regime is 85.5 units, with a very high standard deviation (~41.5) due to a range of 15 to 163 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift starting around Period 16. While the regime from Period 7-15 was characterized by high mean (approx. 100) and extreme volatility (std dev ~41), the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) have shown much lower demand: 15, 24, and 29 respectively. This suggests a potential structural break or a 'dry spell' in the volatile 'chips(Regular)' demand pattern. Current on-hand inventory (91) is quite high relative to these recent observations. To avoid high holding costs while providing coverage in case the volatility returns, I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat with N=12 to bridge the high-volatility period with the recent drop, ensuring the OR engine doesn't over-correct too rapidly but begins to lower ordering levels. Sigma_hat remains high because the recent fluctuation (from 163 to 15) represents high process uncertainty. Lead time L=0 is consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift suspected starting Period 16: demand dropped significantly from a Period 7-15 average of ~100 to a Period 16-18 average of ~23 (-77%).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. A clear demand regime shift was identified starting in Period 16, where demand dropped significantly from an average of ~100 units (P7-P15) to a much lower level (P16: 15, P17: 24, P18: 29, P19: 23). The average demand for this new regime (P16-P19) is approximately 22.75 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 94 units, which is significantly higher than the current average demand. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the high service level (q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new, lower demand level. This will signal the OR backend to place minimal or no orders until inventory levels adjust to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~100 to 22.75 (-77%) over the last 4 periods (P16-P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime since Period 16. The demand values for the last five periods (P16-P20) are 15, 24, 29, 23, and 48, resulting in a mean of 27.8 units. This is a sharp drop from the previous regime (P7-P15), which averaged ~100 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With 46 units currently on hand and no units in transit, the inventory is already sufficient to cover nearly two periods of demand at the new average. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime. The lead time L is set to calculate to maintain the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime since Period 16 confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~100 to 27.8 units (P16-P20), a decrease of ~72%. Demand remains volatile but at a much lower level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Over the last six periods (P16-P21), the mean demand has dropped to approximately 28.5 units (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32), compared to the previous regime (P7-P15) which averaged around 100 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently winding down from the previous high-demand regime, with 14 units remaining on-hand. To align with this new lower-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility (specifically the jump to 48 and 32 in the last two periods), I will set N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entirety of the current 'low demand' period. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history shows stable 0-period lead times. This approach ensures the base stock level is reset to reflect the new, lower average demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance within this regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a historical mean of ~100 to a much lower level. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand has stabilized at 28.0 units (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the most recent arrival in Period 22. Given the sustained nature of this lower demand level (7 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to align with this current regime. This will prevent over-ordering based on the older, higher-demand data while maintaining a target service level appropriate for the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a lower mean: Current 7-period average (P16-P22) is 28.0 units, compared to the ~100 units observed previously.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to 23, the observed values are: 15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35. The mean for these 8 periods is approximately 28.88 units with a standard deviation of 9.76. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), necessitating a new order. I will use a window of N=8 (the length of the current regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to maintain the correct service level for the current demand level without overstocking based on the historical high-demand period (P7-P15).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand (P16-P24), the mean is approximately 29.8 units (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35, 37). The current ending inventory is 1 unit, with no units in transit. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs in this stable but slightly volatile low-demand environment, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture this entire low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower mean and the observed variability within this period, ensuring sufficient stock for the next period's demand without overstocking and incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (Period 16+) continues to be stable: Mean demand for P16-P24 is 29.8 units, compared to the previous regime of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower-demand regime that began at Period 16. However, Period 25 showed a spike to 62 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 9-period average of ~30. This suggests a potential increase in demand or a return to higher volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 due to the Period 25 stockout, I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover this new potential level. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current regime (P16-P25) while including the most recent spike to adjust the mean and variance upward slightly to prevent further stockouts. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16, but recent periods (P25 and P26) show a noticeable uptick in demand (62 and 59 units respectively), compared to the prior stable average of ~29 units from P16-P24. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged approximately 43.6 units with increasing volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent upward trend and increased volatility while moving away from the deeper historical low-demand period, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation. This N=5 captures the shift from the stable ~30s into the recent ~60s demand range, allowing the base stock calculation to respond to the increased pressure and frequent stockouts (observed in P25 and P26) while maintaining inventory for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Slight upward shift in demand observed from Period 25: Mean demand for P25-P26 is 60.5, compared to P16-P24 mean of ~30. This has resulted in immediate stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history suggests we are in a transition period following a low-demand regime (P16-P24, mean ~30). Periods 25-27 saw a jump in demand (62, 59, 31). While Period 27 dropped to 31, the surge in P25 and P26 confirms that a new regime or significant uptick is occurring. The mean of the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 50.7. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in both average demand and volatility, which caused stockouts in P25 and P26. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 based on consistent period-to-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime suspected starting Period 25: Mean demand increased from ~30 (P16-24) to ~51 (P25-27), an increase of ~70% following a sustained low period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting from Period 25, there has been a noticeable shift in demand away from the previous low-mean regime (P16-P24 avg: ~30). The demand for the last four periods (P25-P28) has been 62, 59, 31, and 63, averaging 53.75 units. This confirms the 'new demand regime' suspected in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the arrival history. To adapt to this higher demand level and prevent stockouts (which occurred in P25 and P26), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on this recent regime (N=4). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level sufficient for the current trend while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~30 (P16-24) to 53.8 (P25-28), an increase of ~79%. Demand volatility remains moderate within this new range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 25. Analyzing the data from Period 25 to Period 29, the demand samples are 62, 59, 31, 63, and 22. This gives a mean of 47.4 units for this recent regime. While Period 29 saw a drop to 22 units, the previous periods suggest a higher average is necessary to avoid stockouts like those seen in P25 and P26. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent regime shift (P25-P29), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the ordering policy adapts to the current demand levels (approx 47 units/period) rather than the older low-demand or high-demand regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Historically, it moved from a high-demand phase (P7-P15, mean ~104) to a very low-demand phase (P16-P24, mean ~30), and recently shifted upward again starting at Period 25. For the current regime (P25-P30), the mean demand is approximately 44 units (samples: 62, 59, 31, 63, 22, 29). However, recent periods (P29-P30) show a cooling off with demand at 22 and 29. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of recent stockouts (P25, P26) against the latest lower demand observations, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the entirety of the current regime starting from the Period 25 shift. This provides a stable estimate of the current demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (Period 25-30) mean is 44.3 units (range 22-63), significantly higher than the previous P16-P24 low of ~30 units, but shows recent stabilization in the 20-30 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted upward in Period 25. The current regime (Period 25-31) shows a mean demand of 42.1 (P25: 62, P26: 59, P27: 31, P28: 63, P29: 22, P30: 29, P31: 29). While the initial three periods of this regime were high (avg 51), the last three periods have stabilized significantly lower (avg 26.7). However, to avoid stockouts given the recent high volatility (historical std dev in this regime is approx 18), I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full behavior of this new regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 7 samples to balance the recent dip with the potential for spikes observed earlier in the regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (Period 25-31) mean is 42.1 units; demand has moderated to an average of 26.7 over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) after an initial spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime after a volatile period between Period 25-28. In the most recent four periods (P29-P32), demand has been 22, 29, 29, and 23, resulting in a mean of 25.75 units. This follows the broader regime shift identified at Period 25 where the mean initially spiked to ~54. Given $Profit = 4.0$ and $HoldingCost = 1.0$, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a base stock that covers most of the demand variance. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use a window of N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime starting from P25, which balances the initial spike with the recent moderation. This ensures we don't over-react to the very low recent demand while respecting the overall lower trend compared to earlier in the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 has stabilized at a lower mean recently: while P25-P28 averaged 53.8, the subsequent P29-P32 period averaged 25.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another potential shift or high volatility spike. While Periods 29-32 averaged 25.8 units, Period 33 jumped to 60 units, resulting in a stockout. This follows a pattern where the 'new' regime starting at Period 25 actually has a wider range (22-63) than previously estimated. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all history. To capture the recent behavior which fluctuates between ~25 and ~60, I will use a recent_N approach for demand mean and volatility, specifically looking at the last 9 periods (P25-P33) to cover this entire 'post-low-period' regime. This N=9 captures the spike at P25-P26, the lull at P29-P32, and the recent spike at P33, providing a more robust base stock for the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 is characterized by high volatility (range 22-63) with a mean around 42-44 units; recent stockout at P33 (demand=60) confirms that lower-mean forecasts are insufficient.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility within the regime starting at Period 25. While the regime mean is approximately 41.5 units (P25-P34), the demand fluctuates between 18 and 63 units. Period 33 saw a stockout at 60 units, followed by a drop to 18 units in Period 34. To account for this volatility and prevent stockouts during spikes, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 periods (covering the entire current regime from P25) to capture the average demand level of ~41.5. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 18.0 to represent the high standard deviation observed (calculated at approximately 17.5 for the regime). Standardizing L to 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility within the regime starting at Period 25. Since Period 25, demand has ranged from 18 to 63 units, with a mean of approximately 40.2. While some periods show stabilization in the 20-30 range (P29-P32, P34-P35), occasional spikes like P33 (60 units) cause stockouts if inventory is too low. The most recent period (P35) had a demand of 25. Given the target service level (q = 0.8), we must protect against these recurring spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 25-35) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while allowing the OR engine to buffer against the observed high-side demand.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility within the regime that started at Period 25. While the mean demand for the entire Period 25-36 range is approximately 40.3 units, the recent demand levels (P33-P36) have fluctuated between 18 and 60, with a recent average of 36.5. A stockout occurred at Period 33 when demand spiked to 60. Given on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units) and lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (P25-P36) to capture this volatile but stabilized regime (N=12). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this 12-period window to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed range (18-63) and maintains a high enough base stock to prevent stockouts during spikes. L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime since Period 25 remains volatile with a mean of ~40 units and a wide range (18-63); stockouts occur when demand exceeds 55 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a volatile regime that started around Period 25. Over the last 13 periods (P25-P37), the mean demand is 41.8 units with a high standard deviation (approx 16.5) and a range of 18 to 63. Recent periods show values of 23, 60, 18, 25, 43, and 29. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages), I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=13 to capture the entirety of this current volatile regime (P25-P37), providing a base stock that accounts for both the average (~42) and the high variability seen in this period. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover spikes near 60 units while minimizing excess holding costs during lower-demand dips.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a volatile regime since Period 25, characterized by a mean around 40 units and periodic spikes (e.g., Period 33 demand was 60, Period 38 demand was 42). Over the last 14 periods (P25-P38), the mean demand is 39.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history (e.g., P38 order arrived P38). With on-hand inventory at 11 units and no in-transit stock, I need to set parameters that protect against the high volatility seen in this regime. I will use a recent_N of 14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior since the last confirmed shift at Period 25. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the ~40 mean and the high variance (sigma ~16.5), which is crucial given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a relatively stable but volatile regime since Period 25. The mean demand for this period (P25-P39) is approximately 39.4 units, with values ranging from 18 to 63. Recent demand (P34-P39) has averaged 32 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the OR backend's target service level is high (80%), so we need to account for the volatility seen throughout the current regime (sigma). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use a recent_N of 15 (covering Period 25 to present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior, ensuring the base stock level is robust against spikes like those seen in P25, P28, and P33.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a volatile but relatively stable regime since Period 25. Over the last 16 periods (P25-P40), the mean demand is 39.3, but it exhibits significant swings between 18 and 63. More recently, in the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the mean demand is 34.3 with a standard deviation of approximately 10.6. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) is appropriate. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current regime's volatility and mean, ensuring the base stock level can accommodate the frequent spikes seen in the history (e.g., demand of 60+).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) continues to show significant volatility, with demand fluctuating between 3 and 63 units. Although the most recent demand in Period 41 was unusually low (3 units), the mean since Period 25 remains approximately 36.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory replenishment. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend's base-stock logic will target a service level of approximately 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). To capture the current volatility and the shift that began around Period 25, I am setting the demand parameters based on the last 17 periods (P25-P41). This N=17 is chosen to balance the inclusion of all data from the current regime while being responsive to the broader variance observed within it. Setting L to 0 explicitly as the observed lead time has been rock-solid at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 remains active: Mean demand (P25-P41) is 36.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6; demand continues to exhibit high volatility (range 3-63).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 25, characterized by a mean of approximately 36.5 units and a range of 3 to 63. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. In Period 42, demand was 40 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 12 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.8, which targets a base stock level that covers roughly 80% of demand outcomes. Since Period 25 (the start of the current regime), N = 18 periods (42 - 25 + 1). I will use N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the sustained mean and the high volatility observed in this specific regime. This period-specific N allows the OR engine to better account for the high variance (range 3-63) while maintaining the current mean estimate.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 remains characterized by high volatility (range 3-63) with a mean demand of approximately 38.3 units (calculated over P25-P43). Most recently, Period 43 saw demand jump to 51, resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I must order to cover the full expected base stock for Period 44. To handle the observed volatility and prevent stockouts seen when demand exceeds 50, I will use recent_N (N=19, covering P25-P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the higher variance of the current regime compared to the previous low-demand period, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against spikes while accounting for the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 remains characterized by high volatility, with demand ranging from 3 to 63 units. The mean demand for this regime (P25-P44) is approximately 37.6 units, but recent periods show significant fluctuations (e.g., P41: 3, P43: 51, P44: 7). Lead time is stable at 0. Since the game is nearing its end (Period_45 of 50) and we have 45 units on-hand, the goal is to cover potential high-demand spikes (historical max in this regime is 63) while avoiding excessive holding costs for the final periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical ratio for the service level is 0.8. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (covering the period since the last major regime shift at P25) to capture this volatility while reflecting the current average demand level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 25, with demand ranging from 3 to 63 units. The mean demand for the periods 25-45 is approximately 36.4 units with a standard deviation of about 17.5. Recent periods (P43-P45) show continued volatility (51, 7, 48). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), I will set parameters to cover the expected demand for Period 46. Using recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the characteristics of the current regime while allowing for the high variability observed. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) results in a target service level of 80%, meaning we prioritize avoiding stockouts during these final periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 remains characterized by significant volatility with a mean of approximately 36-38 units and a standard deviation around 17.6. Recently, demand has fluctuated between extreme lows (3 and 7 units) and moderate highs (48 and 53 units). Period 46 concluded with a stockout (on-hand is 0), as demand (53) slightly exceeded supply (50). Since the lead time is confirmed as 0, I must ensure the order covers the full demand for the current period. Given the high volatility (sigma is nearly 50% of the mean) and the stockout in P46, I will use recent_N (N=22, covering the regime from P25 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance and provide a sufficient buffer (z-score against holding cost vs profit ratio). Actual lead time remains 0.

Daily Profit: $28.00, Daily Holding Cost: $45.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established around Period 25. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: P41 (3), P42 (40), P43 (51), P44 (7), P45 (48), P46 (53), and P47 (7). The mean demand for the most recent 10-period window (P38-P47) is 33.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying an 80% service level target) and the erratic 'sawtooth' patterns where low demand (7) is followed by high demand (53), I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current volatility while moving past older data. This approach aims to maintain enough safety stock to cover demand spikes (up to ~60) without accumulating excessive inventory during the lower-demand cycles seen in the last 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High volatility in the P25+ regime continues; 10-period mean (P38-P47) is 33.4 with frequent swings between single-digit demand and mid-50s.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the regime established at Period 25, characterized by significant volatility and a mean of approximately 36 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Recent demand (P46-P48) has shown high variance (53, 7, 41), reinforcing the need to maintain a safety stock that can handle spikes above the mean. Period 46 saw a stockout when demand hit 53, while Period 47 had very low demand of 7. With only two periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), and an on-hand inventory of 10 units, I select mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 24 periods (starting from the P25 changepoint) to capture the full volatility of the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the high demand spikes (up to ~60) seen in this period, balanced against the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the high-volatility regime that started at Period 25. Looking at the most recent 10-period history (P40-P49), the demand exhibits significant swings (ranging from 3 to 53 units) with a mean of approximately 34.1 units and a standard deviation of about 19.3. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'arrived = ordered' events in the same period throughout the history. The current on-hand inventory is 39 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's service level target is high (~80%). I am setting L to default (0), and using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while ignoring the older, lower-demand regime (P16-P24). This ensures the base stock reflects the current variance, protecting against the frequent spikes seen in the P25+ era.
