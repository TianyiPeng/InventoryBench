Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (z-score = 0), meaning the base stock level will target the median demand. We have 5 historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) with a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no specific calendar or product-specific events available to suggest a regime shift, I will use the 'default' methods to leverage all available historical data. Given lead time L=0, the OR engine will determine the base stock based on demand for 1 period (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. Looking at Period 1 history, we ordered 93 units and they arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand in Period 1 was 75, which is lower than the historical sample average of ~92, but within expected variance. Currently, we have 18 units on-hand. Since L=0, the safety stock calculation must cover the current period's demand (1+L=1 period). Historical demand samples are [109, 68, 99, 80, 105] with a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.0. Given that holding cost ($1) equals profit ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median (z=0). I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on all available historical data to establish a stable baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a stockout because demand (129) exceeded the starting on-hand inventory (90). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To recover from backorders/lost sales and meet future demand, I need to adjust the baseline forecast. Demand in Period 1 was 75 and Period 2 was 129. The provided historical samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) suggest a mean around 92. However, the last recorded demand was significantly higher (129), suggesting high volatility or a potential upward shift. I will use the recent 5 historical samples plus the 2 observed periods (total N=7) to better capture the variance and mean, while maintaining the L=0 setting. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N will help address the volatility seen in Period 2 to increase the safety stock buffer given the $1/$1 profit-to-holding ratio (50% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 saw demand of 75, Period 2 saw 129, and Period 3 saw 93. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (sold 90 on a demand of 129), indicating that the current inventory levels are slightly too tight for high-demand spikes. The average demand across these three periods is 99. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level will be q = 0.5. To prevent stockouts on higher-than-average demand days, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3 periods (average 99) and use a recent_N calculation for sigma to capture the volatility (std \u2248 27). This allows the base stock to cover expected demand plus some safety stock, although the high holding cost will naturally keep orders lean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of high demand volatility and stockouts in Periods 2 and 4. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (immediate delivery within the same period). Demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) have a mean of 92.2. However, the 'sold' units in history show that actual demand often exceeded available stock: Period 2 demand was 129 (only 90 sold) and Period 4 demand was 149 (only 99 sold). This indicates the 'true' demand mean is significantly higher than the recorded 'sold' units. Calculating mean based on provided historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) gives 92.2, but the actual demand values recorded in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4 were 75, 129, 93, 149. Averaging these four plus the Period 5 sample (105) gives (75+129+93+149+105)/5 = 110.2. To minimize lost sales with $1 profit and $1 holding cost (50% service level target), I will set mu_hat to 111 using the explicit method to account for the actual demand observed in logs rather than just sales or partial samples, and use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to buffer against the high variance (range 75-149).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. However, demand has been significantly higher than the initial provided samples (P1-P5 samples avg: 92.2; actual P1-P5 demand: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140; avg: 117.2). In 3 out of 5 periods (P2, P4, P5), the system ran out of stock (ending inventory 0), indicating the current ordering logic (based on earlier samples) is underestimating demand. Since demand appears higher and more volatile than the initial data, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this higher mean and variance. This will adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat upwards to better cover the observed demand peaks (reaching 149) and reduce stockouts. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/observed 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: P1-P5 actual demand (avg 117.2) is 27% higher than initial samples (avg 92.2), with peak demand reaching 149.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows a confirmed demand regime shift. The initial 5 historical samples (avg 92.2) were significantly lower than the actual demand observed in Periods 1-6 (avg 114.1). Period 6 saw a slight cooling (99 units), but the overall trend remains high (max 149). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 4, and 5, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods of observed data (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to better reflect the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 28.5) compared to the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, having sold out in Period 7. The demand history across the first 7 periods (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134) shows a mean of 117 units, significantly higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg 92.2). The Lead Time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. To capture the higher demand regime while allowing for the high volatility (Std Dev ~26.5), I will use the last 7 periods of data (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand level better than the global average which includes the lower-demand pre-game samples. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target cycle service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock level will align with the median demand to manage costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand remains consistently higher than the initial pre-game samples. The average demand across Periods 1-8 is approximately 117.25 units, which aligns with the regime shift identified in Period 6. Specifically, recent demand has been volatile, with values of 99, 134, and 109 in the last three periods (Avg ~114). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 0 consistently. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the base stock should roughly equal expected demand for the review period (1+L). However, to avoid stockouts which occurred in Periods 2, 4, 5, and 7, I will use a larger N for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the full high-regime mean, and set sigma_hat to the standard deviation of this same period to account for the observed volatility (approx 25 units). The OR backend's cap mechanism will further regulate the order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 completed steps. Demand remains higher than the initial provided samples. Over the last 9 periods (P1-P9), the mean demand is 113.56 units (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94). The recent 5 periods (P5-P9) average 115.2 units. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR engine's base stock will target the median demand (z=0). To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 4, 5, and 7, I will use recent history (N=9) for both mean and volatility to capture the higher demand regime and its variance. This ensures mu_hat reflects the ~113-115 range observed since start-of-game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand since P1 is 113.6, significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 92.2. Lead time is rock-solid at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 28 units. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 10, the actual demand mean is 110.9 (std ~24.5), which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 92.2. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed periods. Demand in the last three periods (P8-P10) has slightly moderated (averaging 96.3), but volatility remains present (high of 149 in P4, 140 in P5, 134 in P7). Since Lead Time is 0, \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 should represent demand for the current period (1+L=1). I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current regime's higher mean and variability while discounting the initial lower pre-game samples. This approach ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~111 plus a safety buffer for volatility, minus the current 28 on-hand units.

In Period 12, we observe that demand has been slightly lower in the last three periods (94, 86, 78) compared to the earlier regime average (approx 113.6). However, the overall average since the game started remains near 113. Lead time is consistently 0. Given that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each), the OR backend's service level calculation q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 leads to a base stock equivalent to the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 33. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 to capture the full actual game history (P1-P11) which reflects the higher demand regime compared to the pre-game samples, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the observed behavior while smoothing out the very recent minor dip.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level than the initial pre-game samples. Since Period 1, the average demand is approximately 106.6 units (calculated across P1-P12). While there was a peak of 149 in Period 4, recent demand has been more moderate (averaging 85.6 over the last three periods: P10-P12). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 15. To avoid excessive holding costs while meeting demand, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the stabilized regime while filtering the initial lower samples. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=12 to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand dropped significantly to 33, while the average since Period 1 had been approximately 109. This sharp decrease resulted in a high ending inventory of 74 units. Despite this outlier, the overall demand regime since the game started remains higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg 92.2). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to a single low demand point while acknowledging the recent downward trend in the last few periods (78, 93, 33), I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand forecast. This window captures the recent volatility and the recent outlier without completely disregarding the established higher mean. Setting L to 0 (default) as there is no evidence of delivery delays.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit units. Reviewing the demand history, P1-P14 demand averaged approximately 101 units, which remains higher than the initial seed data average of 92.2. A notable outlier occurred in Period 13 (demand 33), which likely led to the very low order of 3 units in Period 14, causing the stockout seen at the start of Period 15. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To recover from the stockout and capitalize on the sustained higher demand regime, I will use the last 14 periods (the entire game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent sharp dip in P13 with the overall higher trajectory of the game periods compared to the seed data. The L parameter remains at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we stocked out again despite ordering 101 units, as demand was 113. Over the last 15 periods, the average demand has been approximately 101.7, which is notably higher than the pre-game sample mean of 92.2. However, Period 13 saw a significant low (33), while other periods frequently peak above 110 or even 140. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This suggests the base stock should align closely with the mean demand to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture the full experienced demand regime which is more representative of current behavior than the 5 initial samples. Lead time is consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated compared to pre-game samples; the 15-period mean is 101.7 vs. initial sample mean of 92.2 (+10%). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the lead time is consistently 0. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high variability recently, with a sharp drop in Period 13 (33 units) followed by a recovery (113 units in P15) and another drop in Period 16 (54 units). The mean demand across all 16 periods is approximately 96.3, which is slightly higher than the pre-game sample mean of 92.2. However, the last 8 periods (P9-P16) show a lower mean of 81.5 compared to the first 8 periods (111.1). Given this significant recent fluctuation and the high holding cost (equal to unit profit), it is crucial to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for potential spikes. I am choosing a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat to capture the full game history mean while smoothing the recent volatility, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to better reflect the current regime's higher variance.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the on-hand inventory is 71 units with 0 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Demand has exhibited high volatility recently: Period 17 saw a low of 28, following a relatively low 54 in Period 16, contrasting with 113 in Period 15 and 101 in Period 14. Despite these recent dips, the long-term average since Period 1 remains around 100. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5 (the median), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use recent_N=17 for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand regime observed since the game started, compared to the initial samples. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=17 to capture the actual realized volatility (std dev approx 32) of this SKU, which is higher than the initial sample set.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a significant downturn in demand for chips(Regular). Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has dropped to 54, 28, and 25 units respectively, compared to the previous 15-period average of approximately 101.7. This suggests a new demand regime, likely a seasonal drop or a post-event lull. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 70 units and recent demand averaging only 35.6 units over the last three periods, we are currently overstocked relative to current consumption. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (recent_N=3) to quickly pivot the base stock calculation to this lower demand level, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $1 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (target cycle service level ~50%).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand downturn detected starting Period 16: demand dropped from a ~102 average to a 3-period average of 35.7 (approx. 65% decrease).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Starting Period 16, demand dropped from a ~102 average to recent observations of 54, 28, 25, and 16. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) is 30.75, confirming the sharp downturn noted in the Period 19 carry-over insight. Given the high volatility of this shift and the risk of holding costs (Holding Cost = Profit = $1.0), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to adapt to this low-demand state immediately. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (arriving same-period), so L remains at 'calculate'. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the lowered variance in this new regime, preventing the OR engine from over-ordering based on historical spikes from the previous high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P19) persists: average demand has dropped to 30.8 units/period, down from the previous long-term average of >100. High inventory on-hand (54 units) is currently sufficient to cover this new demand level for nearly two periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Period 1 and Period 15, the mean demand was approximately 101.5 units. However, starting in Period 16, demand plummeted and has remained in a low-demand state. The demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) has been 54, 28, 25, 16, and 20, resulting in a recent mean of 28.6 units\u2014a decrease of over 70% from the previous level. On-hand inventory is currently 34 units, which marginally exceeds the new mean. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the target base stock equal to the mean (mu_hat). Lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align parameters with this current low-demand regime and prevent costly overstocking.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Period 1 and Period 15, the average demand was approximately 101.7 units. Starting from Period 16, a sharp downturn occurred. The last six periods of demand (P16-P21) are 54, 28, 25, 16, 20, and 38, resulting in a new mean of approximately 30.2 units. The 'Period 21 conclude' shows that our previous overstock (ending P20 with 34 units) was fully depleted by a demand of 38, leaving us with 0 units on-hand. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, we need to order immediately to satisfy the current period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime (P16-P21) while reacting slightly to the uptick in Period 21. Standard deviation will also be calculated over this same 6-period regime. L is set to calculated to reflect the stable 0-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Established low-demand regime: Average demand for Period 16-21 is 30.2, representing a 70% decrease from the previous 100+ average.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 32 units, a significant drop from the pre-P16 average of >100. In Period 22, the actual demand was 44 units, which slightly exceeded the order of 31, resulting in a stockout and 0 ending inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this sustained low-demand regime while accounting for recent variation (range 16-54 in the last 7 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7). This balances the need to capture the current mean while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed within this low-demand state. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR engine will target using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 8 periods (Period 16-23), the demand values are 54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, and 35. This yields a mean of 32.5 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. A base stock policy at q=0.5 targets the median, which for this recent regime is approximately the mean. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this specific regime's mean and standard deviation, ensuring we don't over-order based on the much higher historical demand observed in Periods 1-15.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16. Demand for the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24) consists of {54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31}, averaging approximately 32.3 units per period. The standard deviation in this specific regime is roughly 12 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by Period 24's order arriving instantly. Current on-hand inventory is 2 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this specific demand regime, ensuring the Base Stock level covers current low demand while avoiding excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 10-period window (P16-P25), the average demand is 32.0 units per period. Prior Carry-over Insights correctly identified this shift. The last few periods (P22-P25) have shown consistent demand of 44, 35, 31, and 28. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrival messages. Current on-hand inventory is 5 units. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs (which equal profit per unit), I will use the recent N=10 window to set demand parameters. This captures the current regime's mean (~32.0) and volatility while excluding the high-demand data from the first 15 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 32.1 units per period (353 total / 11 periods). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. To capture the current regime while allowing for slight volatility (demand range 16 to 54), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the order covers the expected demand for the immediate period (L+1 = 1) while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0). In a 0-lead time environment with equal profit and holding cost, the OR backend targeting a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1)) will naturally align our inventory with the mean demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime starting from Period 16. In the most recent 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 35.5 units, which is significantly lower than the historical pre-P16 average of ~100. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, directing the OR engine to target the median demand (base stock = \u03bc\u0302). Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent_N (N=12) captures the entirety of this lower-demand regime while excluding the older, high-demand data that would otherwise inflate inventory. This N includes the transition (P16-P21) and the stabilized low period (P22-P27), providing a safe buffer while minimizing excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~34) now sustained for 12 periods (P16-P27). Lead time is consistently 0 throughout all 27 observed periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Period 16 to Period 28), the average demand is approximately 32.7 units per period. The inventory is currently 0, with no units in transit, meaning a stockout occurred in Period 28. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the mean demand when lead time is 0. Reliable data shows the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use a window of the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we don't over-order based on the much higher historical demand seen in Periods 1-15.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent segment from Period 16 to Period 29 (14 periods), the average demand is approximately 32.9 units per period. The standard deviation in this specific regime is low, around 9.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history, allowing for just-in-time replenishment. For Period 30, with 1 unit on hand and 0 in-transit, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to reflect this sustained low-demand period. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the lead time is extremely stable at 0. This strategy balances the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0) by targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand with a modest safety buffer.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 33.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 5.4. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game, allowing for same-period replenishment. Currently, there are 7 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the Profit of $1.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which means the base stock should roughly equal the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the full stability of this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the 'default' promised lead time of 0.

Analyzing the most recent data (Period 16 to Period 31), the average demand is approximately 32.7 units per period. The standard deviation in this specific regime is significantly lower than the global historical data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately reflect this stabilized low-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (as profit equals holding cost, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's inventory cap logic provides a safety buffer), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a window of the last 16 periods (N=16), which covers the entire duration of the current regime. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the high demand seen in the first 15 periods.

This is a significant shift from the early game average (>100). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With current on-hand inventory at 5 units and no units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture this stable low-demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from the last 15 periods (P19-P33), the average demand is 28.5 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Period 33 showed a particularly low demand of 10 units, which increased on-hand inventory to 24 units. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate of mean and volatility for this current segment. Calculation: L=0, current on-hand=24, recent mean ~28.5, recent std ~9.5. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and order accordingly to cover the next period's demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the low-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 19 periods (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 31.9 units. In the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has been slightly lower at 26.0 units, but with variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 9.2). Actual lead time is consistently 0. Currently, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0. I will use the recent_N method with N=19 to capture the mean of this current low-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) for mu_hat, and recent_N with N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect more recent volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the order for Period 35, targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16, following the initial high-demand phase. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 30.9 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders placed at the start of the period arrive in time for that period's demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained low-demand regime while excluding the very high demand from the start of the game (P1-P15), which would skew the base stock too high. This provides a representative mean and volatility for current conditions, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~31) has remained stable for 20 consecutive periods (P16-P35). Lead time is verified as 0 periods over all 35 concluded periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 31 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. In Period 36, demand was particularly low (10 units), leaving 22 units on-hand for Period 37. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0 each), the OR backend's service level target (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level will target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 20 periods (P17-P36) to capture this stable low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current demand level without excessive holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P18-P37), the average demand is approximately 30 units per period. The physical lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period. Currently, there are 9 units on-hand. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q = 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the median of the demand distribution. I will continue using a recent_N of 20 to capture the statistics of this stable low-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current mean and volatility rather than the much higher initial demand levels.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 30 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units, which is insufficient for the expected demand of ~30. I will continue to use the recent_N method (N=20) to capture the current mean and volatility of this stable low-demand regime. This provides a balance between responding to recent fluctuations (like the dip in Periods 34, 36, and 37) and maintaining enough stock for the average demand of ~30. With profit and holding cost both being $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16, and recent data (P36-P39) suggests a further slight decline, with the last four periods averaging 16.5 units compared to the previous low-demand average of ~31. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With 16 units currently on-hand and a profit-to-holding cost ratio suggesting a 50% service level target (z*=0), the base stock should align closely with 1 period of expected demand. Using recent_N with N=4 captures the most recent downward trend in demand, ensuring we don't over-order and incur excessive holding costs. The OR backend will calculate the order as max(0, base_stock - 16), which will likely result in a small or zero order given current stock and recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand further softening observed P36-P39: average has dropped to 16.5 units, down from the P16-P35 average of ~31.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new, significantly lower regime starting around Period 36. Comparing the previous low-demand regime (P16-P35 avg: 30.6) to the most recent behavior (P36-P40 avg: 14.8), there is a ~50% drop in volume. Specifically, the last four periods of demand were 21, 21, 14, and 8. The lead time remains extremely stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this declining environment, I am switching to recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized mean (approx 14.8/period) and volatility. This will adjust the base stock downward to match the current softening demand while keeping L at its promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Second demand softening confirmed: Period 36-40 average demand is 14.8, a 52% decrease from the P16-P35 average of 30.6. Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand spiked unexpectedly to 51 units, which is a sharp departure from the recent softening trend (average 14.8 units over P36-P40). This spike caused a stockout. However, the last 6 periods (P36-P41) still show an average demand of 20.8, which is lower than the P16-P35 average of ~31. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 41 concluded periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to account for the most recent demand shift (softening plus the recent spike), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased volatility introduced by the Period 41 spike. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at its promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 41 with a sudden spike to 51 units following a period of extreme softening (avg ~15). The 6-period demand average (P36-P41) is 20.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent periods. After a period of extreme softening (averaging ~15 units during P36-P40), Period 41 saw a spike to 51 units, followed by 32 units in Period 42. This suggests the second softening regime was short-lived or the product is experiencing higher variance. Lead time is consistently 0 throughout history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent lost sales during this volatile phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=7 (covering the shift from Period 36 onwards). This captures the recent average of ~22 units and the increased standard deviation, providing a more responsive buffer for the OR engine while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 41 (spike to 51) after a softening phase (avg ~15). The recent 7-period average (P36-P42) is now 22.4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted twice. Initially, it was >100 units, then it dropped to ~31 (P16-P35), and most recently it softened further to ~15 before spiking again. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P41-P43) has been 51, 32, and 35 units respectively. This indicates a resurgence and higher volatility compared to the P36-P40 low (avg 14.8). The recent 3-period average is 39.3, while the 8-period mean (P36-P43) is 24.0. Given the high stockouts in the last three periods (sold < demand), I will set mu_hat more aggressively using a recent_N of 5 to capture this upward movement (approx 27.2 units per period, scaled by 1+L). Lead time is verified as 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend needs to order to meet the base stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after a brief softening: P41-P43 average demand is 39.3 units, significantly higher than the P36-P40 average of 14.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a marked increase over the last four periods. After a period of softening (averaging ~15 units), demand spiked to 51 (P41), 32 (P42), 35 (P43), and 53 (P44). This recent 4-period average is 42.75 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this upward shift while tempering the volatility. Given that profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR base stock policy will target using these updated parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 41: Recent 4-period demand average (P41-P44) has risen to 42.75, compared to the P36-P40 average of 14.8. This represents a nearly 190% increase in volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Following a significant softening period (P36-P40, avg ~15), a new higher-demand regime emerged starting Period 41. The demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) has been: 51, 32, 35, 53, 19, resulting in an average of 38.0 units. Although Period 45 saw a lower demand (19), the overall trend since Period 41 is significantly higher than the previous period's lows. I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current volatility and increased mean (approx 38) while remaining responsive to the sudden drop in P45. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which is confirmed by every concluded order in the history. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, so the OR backend will target the mean demand. With 17 units on hand and 0 in transit, the system will order to reach the new base stock level estimated from the recent 5-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 41: Recent 5-period average (P41-P45) is 38.0 units, indicating a return to higher volume and volatility compared to the P36-P40 average of 14.8 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 41, following a period of extreme softening. The recent 6-period demand average (P41-P46) is 35.5 units (51, 32, 35, 53, 19, 23). This is significantly higher than the P36-P40 average of 14.8. The current on-hand inventory is 15 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the increased volatility and the shift back to moderate demand levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current regime while discounting the previous low-demand period. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers the expected demand spike and volatility without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed (P41-P46): Average demand has risen to 35.5 units, up from the previous softening period (P36-P40) average of 14.8 units.

Daily Profit: $31.00, Daily Holding Cost: $5.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41. Demand was significantly lower between Periods 36-40 (avg ~14.8), but the recent 7-period average (P41-P47) has risen to 34.86 units per period, with high volatility (range 19 to 53). Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L=0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this current demand regime (P41-P47). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this recent period compared to the previous softening phase. This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the current higher demand levels while managing the risk of stockouts during peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 41, with demand levels consistently higher and more volatile than the softening period of P36-P40. The average demand from P41 to P48 is 37.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand average (~15) and slightly above the mid-range average (~31). Current inventory is 0, and the lead time is confirmed as 0. I will set N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P41-P48), as it reflects the most recent and sustained demand pattern. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this higher average and volatility while maintaining a 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift (P41-P48) confirmed: Average demand is 37.5 units, with significantly increased volatility (std dev ~15.5) compared to the P36-P40 softening period.

Daily Profit: $30.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50). The primary objective is to maximize reward, which is profit on units sold minus holding costs on ending inventory. Since this is the last period, any inventory left at the end of Period 50 yields zero profit and incurs a holding cost, while units sold generate profit. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period. Demand has been in a higher volatility regime since Period 41, with an 8-period mean (P41-P48) of approximately 37.5 units and a recent demand of 30 units in Period 49. I will target a base stock level (mu_hat) that reflects this recent 9-period average (P41-P49), which is roughly 36.6. Since we have 8 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, setting mu_hat slightly above this mean while using a small N for sigma_hat allows the OR backend to order enough to meet expected demand without over-purchasing, as any excess inventory results in a loss in this final step.
