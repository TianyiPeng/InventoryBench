Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which is a stable accessory item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 106.6 units (68, 109, 126, 114, 116). There is a slight upward trend from the initial observation, but demand seems to be stabilizing around 110-120 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the total demand to cover is (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the mean of 106.6, mu_hat should be around 533. Given we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need a robust initial order. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the promised lead time and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant historical profile.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', a basic hosiery item. In Period 1, we had a demand of 147 units, but sold 0 because on-hand inventory was 0. An order of 144 units was placed in Period 1; with a promised lead time of 4 periods, it is currently in-transit and expected around Period 5 resolution. The historical demand samples (68, 109, 126, 114, 116) plus Period 1's actual demand (147) suggest an upward trend or a higher mean than the initial samples. The average of all 6 samples is 113.3. Since L=4, mu_hat should reflect (1+4) periods of demand. Given the stockout in Period 1, I will use recent_N to capture the most recent (and higher) demand levels to ensure better availability once stock arrives. I will set L to 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The SKU is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', a basic hosiery item. Initial demand observations (P1: 147, P2: 178) are significantly higher than the 5-week historical samples (mean: ~108.6). This suggests a regime shift or seasonal uptick not captured in the older historical data provided. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced $147 + $178 = 325 units of lost sales due to stockouts. The promised lead time is 4 weeks. With orders placed in P1 (144 units) and P2 (169 units), we do not expect arrivals until P5 and P6 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent high demand periods more heavily, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock level to recover from the current stockout state as soon as shipments begin arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: Mean demand increased from ~109 to ~162 (+48%) based on P1-P2 performance.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' is experiencing a significant stockout situation (on-hand: 0) because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6's decision phase). Demand in the last three periods (147, 178, 141) has been significantly higher than the pre-game samples (mean ~109). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 155. Since we haven't reached the promised lead time yet, there is no evidence to suggest a lead time shift or lost orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this higher regime and 'recent_N' for volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current variance. L will remain 'default' as the lead-time clock is still ticking on the initial orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: average demand increased from ~109 to ~155 (+42%) based on P1-P3 performance.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order placed in Period 1 (144 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's execution. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 700 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4). According to the 'conclude' logic, we will only see the P1 arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Historical demand samples (avg ~107) and recent game demand (P1-P4 avg: 148.75) show a significant shift. The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which likely sees steady early spring demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L, I retain 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed a completed delivery cycle to justify a calculation or explicit change.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Womens Tights', which generally sees steady demand in early spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods (P5 - P1 = 4). Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks: 147, 178, 141, 129, 107) show a mean of ~140.4. This is slightly lower than the initial spike observed in Periods 1-2, but significantly higher than the training data mean of ~106. We currently have 37 units on-hand and 600 in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=5 for demand better captures the current 'in-season' performance compared to the full history. The pipeline (600 in-transit) is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain high parameters to ensure continuity once current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) average is ~140 units, stabilized from an initial peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the product 111586001 (Women's Tights) has stabilized its demand. Examining the history since the order arrivals began (P5-P6), weekly demand has been 107 and 139 (avg ~123). Looking at the full history since P1 (147, 178, 141, 129, 107, 139), the average is approx 140. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by the arrival of P1 and P2 orders in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 67 with 496 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 0.50 (z=0). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the regime since the simulation start, as the pre-simulation samples (avg 106) were significantly lower than the observed demand (avg 140). This N=6 covers the relevant demand window for the lead time L=4 (L+1=5 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', a basic hosiery item. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand analysis: The initial post-training mean (P1-P7) is ~143.8 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 107, 139, 166) shows an upward trend, but the overall regime since Period 1 remains relatively stable around 144. Inventory position: On-hand is 100, In-transit is 435. The In-transit total includes orders from P4 (188), P5 (44), P6 (65), and P7 (138). Given the lead time of 4, the P4 order (188 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P8) and be visible at the start of P9. Current parameters will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand regime shift that began in Period 1. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), the SKU 111586001 (Women's Tights) shows a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history from Period 1 to Period 8 shows a mean of approximately 140 units (Total Demand 1119 / 8 periods = 139.88). The last four weeks (Period 5-8) specifically show a mean of 131 units, suggesting the initial demand surge in February has leveled off. Current on-hand inventory is 176 units with 430 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the stabilized regime since the start of the simulated periods. The Lead Time parameter will use 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistently confirmed over the last 4 arrival events.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand from P1 to P9 (post-pre-seed data) shows an average of 138.8 units, which is consistent with the initial carry-over insight of ~140 units. The last 5 periods (P5-P9) average 131 units, suggesting a slight stabilization or softening after the initial February/March peak. Actual lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). There are no missing shipments. Current inventory levels (89 on-hand + 480 in-transit) are healthy. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the demand regime since P1, and set L to default as the promised lead time of 4 is now proven accurate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for tights usually peaks in late winter/early spring and stabilizes as weather warms. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand has been approximately 135 units. The most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) show a slightly lower, more stable average of 129.6 units compared to the initial post-January spike. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5-P10 arrivals consistently show 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 54, with 541 units in the pipeline (scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the overall post-January demand regime, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the variability seen in that window. I use 'calculate' for lead time as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Socks and Tights) is currently in Period 12 (late April). Historically, lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P11). Demand from P1 to P11 has averaged ~131 units per period, with a slight cooling trend in recent weeks (P10: 100, P11: 103). As we move into late spring/early summer, demand for 30 denier tights typically decreases as weather warms. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 7 periods (approx 122 units per period) to reflect this stabilization and slight downward trend. I'll use a lead time (L) of 4. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target using the base_stock calculation. Pipeline inventory (483) plus on-hand (89) is 572 units, which covers nearly 4.7 periods of demand at current rates.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized around 125-130 units from P5-P11, signaling an end to the early-year regime shift. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is Women's Tights, which tends to experience stable demand during spring, transitioning away from winter peaks but maintaining baseline sales for office wear/events. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P5-P12) shows a stable demand regime with an average of approximately 121.3 units (107, 139, 166, 112, 131, 100, 103, 113). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand (159) plus in-transit (341) equals 500 units, which covers roughly 4.1 periods of the current average demand. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover lead time + 1 period (5 total). I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' (as history is stable) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the stabilized mean of ~121.3 per week. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect current volatility. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, so the OR engine will aim to keep inventory near the expected demand over the lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, demand for tights/leggings is relatively stable in late spring, following an earlier post-New Year peak. Looking at the history from Period 8 to Period 13, demand has averaged 113.8 units per week (min 100, max 131). The previous 'carry_over_insight' noted stabilization around 125-130 units, but recent weeks (P10-P13) show a slightly lower, more consistent mean of approximately 110-115 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 129 units and 354 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13), the total pipeline is 483 units. For Period 14, I am setting L=4 and using a recent 6-period window (P8-P13) to capture this stabilized demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses on the post-peak stability to avoid over-ordering as we move further into the warmer months where demand for 30 denier tights typically levels off or slightly declines.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 111586001 (Shape Up Tights) has stabilized following an early-year peak. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P5-P14) reveals an average demand of approximately 118 units, compared to the higher volatility seen in P1-P4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Given the current on-hand inventory (172) and in-transit units (315), the system is well-stocked for the 5-period window (L+1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this stabilized demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the February surge. The Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level (safety stock) that balances stockout risk against inventory costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower level (~118 units) from P5-P14 compared to the P1-P4 peak (~149 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is tights/hosiery, which typically sees lower demand moving into late spring and summer. Historical demand data shows a significant downward trend over the last three periods: 124 (P13), 83 (P14), and 58 (P15). The average demand over these three periods is 88.3 units, compared to the previously stabilized mean of ~118 units. This confirms a seasonal shift as warmer weather reduces hosiery demand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 194 and in-transit at 337 (total pipeline 531), and a 5-period horizon (L+1), we are currently overstocked relative to the new low-demand regime (531 / 5 = 106 units/period capacity). I will use recent_N=3 to capture this sharp drop in demand for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and use the default lead time which matches observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand drop detected starting Period 14: mean demand decreased from ~118 to ~88 (-25%) as of Period 15, likely due to spring/summer seasonality for hosiery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 30 denier tights, which is highly seasonal and typically sees a sharp demand decline as temperatures rise in late spring/early summer. The historical data and carry-over insights confirm this: demand dropped from a stable ~120 units (P5-P13) to 83 units (P14), 58 units (P15), and just 25 units (P16). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (210) and significant in-transit stock (296), the total pipeline inventory (506) is far in excess of the projected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current demand rate of ~25 units, 5 periods would only require ~125 units. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will correctly suppress orders given this surplus. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent sharp decline and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand collapse confirmed: demand dropped from ~120 units/week in early May to 25 units/week by June 3rd, marking a ~80% decrease in 3 weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits significant downward seasonality as the weather warms (approaching summer in June). Demand has collapsed from ~120 units/week in early May to an average of ~31 units/week over the last three periods (P15-P17: 58, 25, 37). On-hand inventory is currently 280 units, and in-transit inventory is 189 units, totaling 469 units. Given the new low-demand regime, this pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (469 / 31 \u2248 15.1), far exceeding the (L+1) window of 5 weeks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sharp seasonal decline for forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for lead time. The OR backend will likely generate a zero order to draw down the excess stock, which aligns with minimizing holding costs during the off-season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which has high seasonal sensitivity as warmer weather (June) significantly reduces demand for tights. Since Period 16 (late May), current demand has collapsed from ~120 units/week to a low range of 25-37 units/week. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand average is 30.33 units. On-hand inventory is currently 338 units, which covers over 10 periods of current demand levels, and there is an additional 102 units in-transit. To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new seasonal low regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is hosiery (tights), which exhibits a strong seasonal decline as temperatures rise in June. Since Period 16 (late May), demand has plummeted from over 100 units/week to just 15 units/week in Period 19. My carry-over insights correctly identified this collapse. Current on-hand inventory is 425 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~15-30 units, covers over 14 weeks of supply. Since Profit ($1) is equal to Holding Cost ($1), the QR target service level is 50%. Carrying excess inventory is highly penalized. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to its lowest historical level using recent_N=3 (average demand ~27) to minimize further ordering and allow existing stock to bleed down. The 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend, combined with high on-hand inventory relative to this low forecast, should result in an order of 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme seasonal low confirmed: June demand average dropped to ~24 units/week (P17-P19), an 80% decrease from April levels. Inventory levels are currently excessive for summer demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21 (July 1st). The product (30 denier tights) is experiencing a severe seasonal demand collapse as expected for mid-summer. Demand in Period 20 was only 5 units, continuing a downward trend from approximately 30 units/week to single digits. On-hand inventory is currently 420 units, which is extremely high (covering over 80 weeks of demand at the current rate of 5 units/week). No units are in transit. To prevent further accumulation of units and incurring excessive holding costs, I am keeping orders at zero by setting the lead time L to the default (promised 4) and using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the summer floor of demand (~20 units/week averaged over P17-P20). With on-hand inventory (420) significantly exceeding the calculated base stock (approximately (1+4)*21 = 105), the OR engine will correctly skip ordering. I will maintain recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July: demand has dropped into single digits (P20: 5 units), well below the June average of ~20 units/week.

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8th). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which is highly seasonal. Demand has collapsed from ~120 units/week in May to single digits in July (Period 20: 5 units, Period 21: 4 units), confirming a summer trough. On-hand inventory is currently 416 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~4-5 units/week). At the current rate, our existing stock covers over 80 weeks of demand, while the lead time is only 4 periods. The goal is now to minimize holding costs while demand is at its seasonal minimum. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime (Periods 19, 20, 21 demand: 15, 5, 4). This will result in a very low base stock, ensuring no new orders are placed by the OR engine until on-hand inventory is significantly depleted or demand picks back up.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for tights is sustained: July weekly demand has dropped to <5 units, down from ~25 units in early June and ~120 units in May.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the summer trough for 'Shape Up 30 den Tights'. Demand in July has been extremely low, with the last three periods recording 5, 4, and 13 units respectively. The current date is July 15th, and since this is a heavy-weight (30 denier) tight product, no significant recovery is expected until the approach of autumn. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 403 units, which is enough to cover over 30 weeks of demand at the current average of ~10 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the inventory surplus, the goal is to prevent any new orders until the 'on-hand' reduces significantly. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this summer dormancy, which will result in a base stock level far below current inventory, effectively placing zero orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits a massive seasonal decline during the summer months (June-July). Current demand is extremely low, averaging approximately 8.5 units over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) and 8.6 units over the last 8 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 391 units and zero units in-transit, we are severely overstocked relative to the current demand regime. The immediate goal is to prevent any new orders and minimize holding costs while the excess inventory gradually depletes. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods to capture this sustained low-demand state and ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for 30 denier tights is stable at ~8-10 units per week throughout July (confirmed P20-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits strong seasonality. Current date is late July (Period 25). Demand for tights remains in a deep summer trough, with the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 7.8 units per week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 386 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 49 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high service level target (based on $1 profit / $1 holding cost), the priority is to avoid ordering any additional stock while demand is low and inventory is bloated. I am setting L to the consistent actual lead time of 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized summer floor. This should result in a base stock level far below current inventory, ensuring zero orders are placed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (early August). Historically, demand for this item (30 denier tights) plummeted starting in mid-May (Period 14) and has remained in a summer trough throughout June and July. Recent demand samples (P20-P25) are: 5, 4, 13, 12, 5, 15, resulting in a 6-period average of 9.0 units. On-hand inventory is very high at 371 units, while the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0 each). Given the lead time is 4 periods, total expected demand over the next 5 periods (approx. 45 units) is dwarfed by current stocks. The goal is to aggressively burn off excess inventory. I will set mu_hat to be explicit based on the recent summer average to minimize any new orders being triggered by the OR backend. Sigma is also kept low to reflect the stabilized trough.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand for 30 denier tights has been in a severe summer trough since June/July (averaging <10 units/week). However, Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 45 units, which may signal the early stages of a 'back-to-school' or 'pre-autumn' demand recovery as weather begins to transition or shoppers prepare for the cooler season. On-hand inventory is very high (326 units), which is approximately 7-8 times the most recent week's demand and over 30 times the summer average. No new orders have been placed since Period 15, and 'In-transit' is 0. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered even if demand continues to rise. My goal is to allow the high on-hand inventory to deplete toward a more reasonable level while remaining responsive to the expected autumn recovery. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the shift from 'trough' to 'early uptick') to capture this transition while maintaining a safe sigma to account for return-to-school volatility.

Carry-over insight: Early signs of autumn recovery detected at Period 26: demand increased from summer trough (<15 units) to 45 units (+200% from previous week).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (30 denier tights) is entering an autumn recovery phase. Demand has increased from a summer low of <10 units to 45 (P26) and now 79 (P27), signaling a clear upward trend as temperatures likely begin to cool in late August. On-hand inventory is 247 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are planning for the period from P28 to P32. The current jump to 79 units/week suggests we are rapidly approaching the spring stabilized mean of ~115-120 units. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (1+4 periods * 90 units/week) to capture this recovery without over-ordering before the trend fully stabilizes. This represents an average of 90 units across the next 5 weeks, accounting for further growth from the current 79. Since demand is in a transition phase, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to allow for higher volatility during this seasonal shift. L remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed for late August: Demand grew from summer trough (<15 units) to 45 (P26) and 79 (P27), a significant and sustained upward trajectory (+500% over 2 weeks).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-135.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). Demand history shows a clear seasonal pattern: high early-year demand (~110-150), a summer trough (~5-15 units), and a sharp autumn recovery starting in Period 26. Demand in the last three weeks was 45, 79, and 56. While Period 28 saw a slight dip from Period 27, the trend is significantly higher than the summer baseline. We are entering the peak season for tights (autumn/winter). On-hand inventory is 191, and there are 135 units in-transit (ordered P28, arriving P32). Total pipeline is 326. Given the confirmed upward trajectory and historical pre-summer levels of 110-130 units per week, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand settings with N=3 to capture the recovery (avg ~60), but since this is an accelerating seasonal trend, I will use 'explicit' values to ensure we cover the anticipated growth toward 100+ units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L=4, mu_hat=550 (forecast 110/week * 5), and sigma_hat=78 (sqrt(5) * approx 35) to maintain inventory as demand scales back to normal autumn levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery sustained: Period 26-28 average demand is 60 units/week, up from <15 in summer. Trend indicates return to ~100+ units/week regime observed in early spring.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (Sept 2nd). The product (30 denier tights) is entering its primary autumn sales season. Historical demand in Feb/March (the previous high-demand window) was ~130-140 units/week. Since the recovery started in Period 26, the demand has been 45, 79, 56, and 54. This averages to 58.5 units. However, looking at the same time last year (pre-game samples) and the spring data, demand typically hits 100-120 units as weather cools. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on a transition toward that 100-unit/week regime. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Projected demand for the next 5 periods is estimated at an average of 85 units/week (blending current 55-60 with expected rise to 100+), totaling 425 units. On-hand is 137 and In-transit is 303 (Total Pipeline = 440). This is currently sufficient, but we must maintain momentum as the peak approaches.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery sustained for 4 periods (P26-P29). Mean demand increased from <15 to ~58 (+300%). Anticipating continued growth toward 100-120 units/week based on spring performance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (30 denier tights) has clearly exited its summer trough and is now in a strong autumn recovery phase. Period 30 saw demand spike to 147 units, which exceeded the on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. This indicates that the 100-120 units/week regime from early spring is likely returning or being exceeded as temperatures drop in September. Current on-hand is 0, but there are 303 units in-transit (ordered in P28 and P29). With a stable 4-period lead time, the 135 units ordered in P28 are expected to arrive in P32 (after next period's decision). To prevent further stockouts during this recovery, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P26-P30) to capture the upward trend. This reflects a weekly mean of ~76, but given the P30 jump to 147, the OR backend needs to recognize the shift in volatility and mean quickly to rebuild the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Autumn recovery intensified; demand hit 147 units in P30, causing a stockout. This confirms a return to (or exceeding) the spring regime (~120 units/week). Initial recovery phase (P26-P29) mean was ~58, but P30 suggests a secondary jump.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (30 denier tights) is experiencing a sharp autumn rebound. Period 31 demand reached 203 units, significantly higher than the previous spring's average of ~120-140 units. This indicates a secondary jump in demand following the initial recovery phase (P26-P29). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline that hasn't arrived yet (P28 order is due in P33). Because the current demand level of 203 units is a new peak, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the recovery spike (147, 203) alongside the prior 54, which results in a safer baseline estimate than the spring average. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) as it has been extremely stable at 4 periods. Since the volatility has increased with the volume recovery, I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=6) to ensure the safety stock covers this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Secondary autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand jumped from ~58 (P26-P29) to 203 (P31), exceeding spring peaks (~140).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn surge. Period 31 and 32 demand (203, 215) far exceeds the spring peak (~140). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which strongly correlates with colder weather and typical back-to-school/autumn office wear seasonality. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). An order of 135 units arrived in P32 (from P28), which was immediately sold. An order from P29 (168 units) is expected to arrive in P33. However, with demand exceeding 200 units, the pipeline remains insufficient. I am setting L=4 (stable). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this secondary surge (P30-P32 demand: 147, 203, 215; average = 188.3). This will result in a mu_hat of ~942 (5 * 188.3). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility of this recovery phase. This aggressive setting aims to replenish inventory and minimize lost sales during this seasonal peak while balancing the 1:1 profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Secondary autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand for P30-P32 (147, 203, 215) represents a new regime significantly higher than the spring peak (~140) and initial autumn recovery (~60). Average demand is now ~190 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (30 denier tights) is experiencing a massive autumn demand surge, significantly exceeding the spring peaks and even recent recovery levels. Demand in P33 reached 344 units, following 147, 203, and 215. The current average demand for this secondary surge (P30-P33) is ~227 units/week. We are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P28 arrived in P32, P29 arrived in P33). We have 567 units in-transit (ordered in P31, P32, and P33). To ensure we capture this peak demand and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the specific intensity of this second surge (average ~227). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N=4' to account for the high volatility during this ramp-up. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (4 periods) as it remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Secondary autumn surge intensified in Period 33: Demand reached 344 units, pulling the 4-week average (P30-P33) to ~227 units/week. This significantly exceeds the spring regime (~140) and highlights extreme seasonal demand for tights in late September/October.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights) is experiencing a massive seasonal surge that began in late August and has accelerated through September. Demand has consistently exceeded 200 units per week, with a peak of 344 in P33 and 311 in P34, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). We are currently in a high-demand regime for autumn/winter. The 4-week average (P31-P34) is approximately 268 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory deficit, we must forecast based on this high-growth regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this peak demand (approx 268 * 5 = 1340 units for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the high volatility seen during this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand has shifted from a recovery phase (~60 units) to a high-intensity peak phase starting P31, averaging ~268 units/week (P31-P34), which is ~2x the spring peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn/winter season for tights (30 denier). Demand has shifted aggressively from a recovery phase (~60 units/week) to a high-intensity peak. Following the initial surge evidence from P31-P34 (avg ~268), the most recent demand points (P34: 311, P35: 317) indicate a stabilization or continued slight ascent at a very high level. Current on-hand is 0, and we are experiencing frequent stockouts because the supply chain (L=4) is struggling to keep up with this rapid seasonal ramp-up. Pipeline inventory is high (1238), but much of it was ordered at lower levels during the early recovery. We need to set mu_hat to reflect the current peak regime (approx 315 units per week). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the P32-P35 surge, which averages ~297 units per week. Given the high volatility during this ramp-up phase (demand increased from 147 to 344 in weeks), I will use an explicit sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend's service level logic accounts for this extreme variance and maintains a high base stock to prevent further stockouts in this highly profitable peak period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensified: Demand has stabilized at a high-intensity regime of ~315 units/week (P34-P35 evidence), which is significantly higher than the initial autumn recovery of ~60 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits strong seasonal demand. We are currently in the October peak (Period 37). Assessment of recent demand (P33-P36: 344, 311, 317, 266) suggests a high-intensity regime averaging ~310 units/week. Although demand dipped slightly in P36 to 266, it remains far above spring levels (~140). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,244 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by P31 and P32 arrivals). To ensure availability during this high-demand phase while managing the risk of a late-autumn drop-off, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current ~310 mean, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the high volatility seen in the autumn surge. This will direct the OR backend to target a base stock covering (4+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime stabilized: Period 33-36 average demand is ~310 units/week, compared to the spring peak of ~140. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (30 den tights) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. In Period 37, demand was 324 units, and the average over the last four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 305 units/week. This represents a stabilized high-intensity regime compared to the spring peak of ~140. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P35, P36, and P37. Currently, the system is frequently stocking out because on-hand inventory is depleted by high demand before the next shipment arrives. Although in-transit inventory is high (1299 units), the OR backend's default 'cap' might be too restrictive given the sudden regime shift from summer lows to autumn peaks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand mean (~305) and volatility. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-demand regime ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while the demand remains at its peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn/winter demand season for tights (SKU 111586001). Demand has stabilized at a high-intensity regime, with the last four weeks (P35-P38) showing demands of 317, 266, 324, and 293 units respectively, averaging ~300 units/week. This follows the massive jump from early autumn recovery (~60 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P34 order in P38. Currently, on-hand inventory is 72 units, and pipeline inventory is substantial (1158 units) due to large orders placed during the ramp-up phase (P35-P38). To maintain a high service level during this peak, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current ~300 units/week average (resulting in a target of (1+4)*300 = 1500 units covering the lead time and review period). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the volatility within this high-demand regime. This approach ensures the capped base-stock policy has enough 'target' to cover demand without over-ordering as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime confirmed stable at ~300 units/week (P35-P38 average: 300). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' has reached a high-intensity peak phase characterized by cold-weather seasonality in November. Since Period 35, demand has stabilized at a high plateau with an average of approximately 288 units per week (P35: 317, P36: 266, P37: 324, P38: 293, P39: 277). This confirms the 'Autumn/Winter high-demand regime' identified in previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the OR engine will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, so I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable peak while excluding the initial explosive growth from the assessment of variance. The goal is to maintain sufficient inventory for this sustained high-demand period while being cautious as we approach the end of the year/game.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 111586001 (tights) is in a stable high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), weekly demand has averaged 297 units (266, 324, 293, 277, 325), confirming the ~300 units/week regime identified in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 100 on-hand and 1052 in-transit, the pipeline inventory is approximately 1152 units. Our (L+1) target demand (covering 5 periods) is approximately 1500 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this sustained high-demand level. Using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat provides an appropriate volatility estimate (std dev ~23) for this regime, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (30 denier tights) is currently in its peak Autumn/Winter demand season. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized at a high-intensity regime, averaging approximately 298 units per week (P33-P41). The last four weeks (P38-P41) show very consistent demand: 293, 277, 325, and 290 units. On-hand inventory is 114, with a large pipeline of 1081 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). To maintain the high service level required by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (implying a 50% critical fractile, though the OR backend uses a capped policy for safety), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 9 periods (P33-P41) to capture this specific seasonal peak accurately. N=9 covers the transition to the current ~300 unit level. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the very low volatility observed in the most recent month of the peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand confirmed stable at ~300 units/week from P33 to P41 (average 298). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with the product out of stock (remaining demand in P42 was 355 vs 338 units available). Demand remains in the high-intensity Autumn/Winter regime, which has been stable at approximately 300 units/week (P33-P42 average: 304). Calendar context: it is early December (2019/12/2), the heart of winter for tights. I expect demand to remain high or slightly increase towards the end-of-year holidays. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P35-P42). The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 1189) includes orders from P39 (270), P40 (254), P41 (333), and P42 (332), totaling 1189. The P39 order (270 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P43). I will set L=4, and mu_hat to 1500 (5 periods * 300 units/week) to reflect the current regime. While we are approaching the end of the simulation (P47), the current stockout and high demand require a baseline order to ensure service levels through the final weeks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the final stretch of the game. The product (30 denier tights) is in its peak seasonal demand phase (Autumn/Winter). Recent demand (P33-P43) has averaged approximately 293 units/week. Although demand dipped to 197 in P43, the previous weeks (P40-P42) were consistently near or above 300 (325, 290, 355). I will maintain the mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (P33-P43) to capture this high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent slight volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining after this decision (P44-P47), and a lead time of 4, orders placed now are the last to arrive before the game ends. Pipeline inventory is high (1277), and we have 73 on-hand. The OR backend will balance the service level (profit vs holding cost are equal at $1.0) using these peak-season parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter season (December) for 30 denier tights. Demand remains high but has stabilized. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 305 units/week. Recent periods show values of 355, 197, and 319. While P43 (197) was lower, P44 (319) confirms the high-demand regime is still active for late December/Christmas. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 8 units on-hand and 1173 in-transit, the system needs to maintain the pipeline to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand stability (~305/week) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the peak of Winter demand for tights. Demand in Period 45 hit 475 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~300. This spike is likely driven by pre-Christmas/holiday party shopping. While demand may stay high for New Year's, it typically drops in early January. However, with an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering for arrivals in Period 50. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 10 periods (P36-P45) to capture the recent upward intensity (average ~314) while acknowledging the P45 outlier. The OR backend will use these revised stats to calculate the base stock for the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (1141) is substantial, including orders from P42-P45, but current stockouts indicate we need to maintain a high base stock to prevent further lost sales during the winter tail-end.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed at Period 45: Demand reached 475 units (+58% vs ~300 average) during the week of Dec 16th.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, immediately following the peak holiday shopping season (mid-to-late December). Historical demand for Period 45 (475 units) and Period 46 (462 units) confirms a significant holiday spike, roughly 50-60% above the Autumn/Winter baseline of ~300 units/week. However, historically, demand for tights/hosiery tends to stay elevated in January due to winter weather but typically begins to stabilize or slightly decline from the extreme Christmas peak. On-hand inventory is 0 due to the high end-of-year demand. Pipepline inventory is healthy at 1229 units. To prevent over-ordering as the holiday peak subsides while maintaining high availability for the remaining winter weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high-demand regime of December (avg ~363 units) while expecting a natural post-holiday cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P45-P46): Mean demand surged to ~468 units (+56% vs Autumn baseline).
