Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 243937001 (Women's Straight Edge 5p Socks). Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 78 units/week with a standard deviation of 7.6. The product is a staple item (fine-knit cotton blend socks). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all 5 historical samples to calculate mean and standard deviation. Although it's mid-February, there is no strong evidence yet of a seasonal shift compared to January, so the full historical average is the most stable predictor.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Straight Edge 5p Socks', a staple item. Initial on-hand was 0. In Period 1, we ordered 92 units, but since the promised lead time is 4, we don't expect arrivals yet. Demand in Period 1 was 54, but sales were 0 due to stockout. Total historical demand samples (including pre-game) are: 70, 77, 91, 79, 73, and now 54. The last sample (54) is lower than the previous range (70-91), but it's only one data point, possibly reflecting post-winter cooling. To set OR parameters: L is set to default (4). For mu_hat, the mean of all 6 samples is 74. With L=4, review+lead = 5 periods. 5 * 74 = 370. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of all samples is approximately 11.9. sqrt(5) * 11.9 \u2248 26.6. I will use 'default' for all parameters to allow the OR backend to use the full sample history, as there isn't yet enough evidence for a sustained regime shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is women's socks, which generally shows stable demand but has currently resulted in lost sales due to zero on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (92 units) and P2 (95 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 187). Following the promised lead time (L=4), the P1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5 (visible in P5 conclude/read in P6). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 70, 77, 91, 79, 73) show a mean of ~78. Recent demand in P1 (54) and P2 (72) is slightly lower but consistent with a stable regime. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent distribution, and 'default' for lead time as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is a staple item. Initial inventory was 0, and because the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals have occurred yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5). Consequently, no sales have been made and stockouts are occurring. Historical demand samples (before P1) were 70, 77, 91, 79, 73 (mean ~78). Observed demand in P1-P3 (54, 72, 48) is slightly lower but consistent with standard variance for this SKU. Without confirmed arrivals, I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to include both pre-game samples and in-game demand to capture the current mean more accurately. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect observed volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (4+1) periods of demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Fine-knit socks. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (read at Period 6). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in Periods 1-4 conclude messages is expected and does not yet prove a lead time shift or loss. Current on-hand is 0, meaning all demand so far (54+72+48+38=212) has been lost. The pipeline (in-transit) is 353 units. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has a mean of approximately 71.7. Recent demand (last 4 periods excluding samples) has a mean of 53.0, showing a slight decrease. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand 0), I will use the recent mean (N=4) for mu_hat to be responsive, but stick to the default L=4 until we see the first arrival. This will calculate a base_stock to cover the lead time + 1 review period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 55 units on hand and 261 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand data suggests a mean of 78 units (pre-start samples) but observed demand in the game (Periods 1-5) has been lower (Avg: 49.8). Given the product is 'Womens Nightwear Socks', we are moving away from the peak winter season (Feb/Mar), which explains the recent drop in demand from the ~70-90 range to the ~35-50 range. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this recent lower demand trend (avg ~40.25) across the (L+1=5) period window. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand dropped from pre-start average (~78) to in-game average (~50) and recent 4-week average (~40) as we transition out of peak winter season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which typically sees a seasonal decline as we move into spring. The historical demand before the game started averaged ~78, but the in-game demand has dropped significantly: P1:54, P2:72, P3:48, P4:38, P5:37, P6:31. The last 4 periods average 38.5 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 119, with 166 in transit (P3: 96, P4: 70). To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this new lower-demand regime. This sets the base stock calculation around the current average of ~38-40 units per period. With L=4, the coverage needed is for 5 periods (L+1), approximately 190-200 units. Since on-hand + in-transit = 285, the OR engine will likely not place a new order this period, which is appropriate given the inventory surplus and seasonal downtrend.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Evaluating historic demand, the pre-game mean was ~78 (early/mid-winter), but since start-of-game (Period 1-7), demand has dropped significantly: 54, 72, 48, 38, 37, 31, 38. The average over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) is 38.4 units. As we enter April, these 'soft cotton blend' socks are likely seeing a seasonal decline from winter peaks. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 177) due to late arrivals of initial orders and declining demand. The pipeline contains 70 units from Period 4, which are expected to arrive in Period 8. Total inventory position (177 + 70 = 247) already far exceeds the 5-period demand (L+1) required (estimated at ~192 based on mean of 38.4 * 5). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower-demand spring regime and prevent further overstocking since Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, meaning we should target a 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~38 units/period (average Periods 3-7) reflecting spring seasonality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which shows a clear demand shift from the winter peak (avg ~78) to a stable spring regime (avg ~38). Over the last 6 periods (P3-P8), demand has averaged 37.7 units. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (as observed in P5, P6, P7, and P8 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 213 units with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4, (L+1) periods of demand at a rate of ~38 units is approximately 190 units. Our current inventory (213) already exceeds this requirement. To avoid excessive holding costs in this high-holding-cost environment ($1/unit vs $1 profit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 6 periods of stable demand to prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a safe stock level for the current regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the demand remains consistent with the stabilized spring regime identified in Period 8. The average demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 3-9) is approximately 36.7 units, with the most recent three periods even lower at 31-34 units. We have 182 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service cycle of L+1 = 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 5 * 37 = 185 units. Since we currently have 182 units on-hand, we are already sufficiently stocked for the current demand level. Significant overstocking occurred due to earlier orders placed during higher demand periods. To avoid further increasing holding costs (which equal profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods, as confirmed by historical arrivals in Periods 5-8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-142.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has consistently declined as we move into late spring. The regime shifted from an initial average of ~54-72 units in February to a recent average of approximately 30 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10: 31, 38, 34, 31, 20). The last period (P10) saw a further drop to 20 units. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on all history (P1 through P4 arrivals). On-hand inventory is healthy at 162 units, which covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand. With Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) being equal, the target service level is 50%, requiring a base stock close to the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Since 162 units significantly exceeds the expected demand of ~150 units for the next 5 periods, the OR engine will naturally minimize ordering. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized spring demand regime, avoiding the high winter-start outliers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in April: Average demand decreased from ~38 (Periods 3-7) to ~30 (Periods 6-10), with a recent low of 20 units in Period 10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has consistently declined as we move further into the spring season, typical for winter-oriented hosiery. Demand in Period 11 reached a new low of 17 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 28 units, but the most recent two periods (P10, P11) recorded 20 and 17 units respectively, suggesting a stabilization at a lower level (~20). Lead times remain stable at precisely the promised 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at L=4). With 145 units on hand and only 2 units in transit, the inventory is high relative to the current low demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the spring downturn while acknowledge the most recent volatility. Given the 1:1 Profit:Holding ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, and high safety stocks are discouraged.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower spring floor: Average demand for Periods 10-11 is ~18.5 units, down from the Period 6-10 average of ~30 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is fine-knit cotton blend socks, which typically see a demand decline as we move from winter/spring into summer. Historical demand has consistently dropped: from pre-game ~78 to ~50 (Periods 1-3), then ~35 (Periods 4-9), and now stabilizing at ~18.5 (Periods 10-12). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on early deliveries. We are currently overstocked with 126 units on hand and only 2 in transit, while the latest demand is around 17-20 units. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), it is critical to lower the base stock level to avoid mounting holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (N=3, Periods 10-12, Avg=18.67) to calculate the 5-period requirement (L+1) as approximately 93.35 units. Since on-hand (126) > forecast (93), the OR backend will correctly stop ordering until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~19 units/period in May (Periods 10-12 avg: 18.67), confirming a transition to summer demand levels for cotton socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which has shown a clear downward trend from winter peaks. Demand has stabilized at a low summer floor, with an average of 18.25 units over the last 4 periods (P10-P13: 20, 17, 19, 17). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 109 units, which is extremely high (approximately 6 periods of supply at current demand levels). The OR backend uses a base stock policy (z* is 0 for profit=holding cost), so target stock would be (L+1)*mu. With L=4 and mu\u224818, the target is ~90. Since on-hand (109) + in-transit (2) is 111, the system will not place new orders, which is ideal to reduce high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 18-unit regime and keep L as default.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for these cotton socks has stabilized at a summer floor of approximately 19 units per period (average of the last 5 periods P10-P14 is 18.8 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Currently, there is 90 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. With demand at ~19 units/period, the current inventory covers about 4.7 periods, which aligns with the (L+1) coverage target for a 4-period lead time. However, to maintain the base stock level (approximately 5 * 19 = 95 units), the OR engine needs parameters reflecting this regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stable low-demand period since late April. L will remain at the default (4).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend' has recently shown a slight uptick in the last two periods (21 units in P14 and 33 units in P15), compared to the mid-May average of ~19 units. This may indicate a minor early-summer demand fluctuation. On-hand inventory is 57 units with 4 units in-transit. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P14). Since Promised Lead Time (L=4) plus the current review period covers 5 periods of demand, and the recent 5-period average (P11-P15) is approximately 21.4 units, the current on-hand inventory (57) still provides over 2.5 periods of coverage. However, with the uptick to 33 units last period, I will increase mu_hat slightly to reflect the recent mean of the last 3 periods (~23.7) to ensure the OR backend doesn't under-order if this trend continues. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and continue with calculate for lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for these cotton-blend socks has settled into a summer regime. Recent demand (Periods 13-16) was 17, 21, 33, and 15, yielding an average of 21.5 units per period. The spike in Period 15 (33 units) appears to be an outlier compared to the surrounding weeks. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P14). On-hand inventory is 42 units, with 37 units in-transit (ordered in P15 and P16). Total pipeline + on-hand is 79 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the stabilized spring/summer demand (~23 units/period) while being responsive to the lower volume compared to the early-year peaks. L remains default (4 periods). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the narrowed variability of this stable period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are in a low-demand summer regime for cotton socks. Demand has further softened over the last three weeks (P15: 33, P16: 15, P17: 12), averaging 20 units. The carry-over insights earlier confirmed a stabilization around 19 units, but current data suggests a potential slight dip below that. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by the P10 order delivered in P14). On-hand inventory is 30 units, with 60 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, and P17). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~18.8) to project a total requirement of roughly 94 units. With 30 on-hand and 60 in-transit, we are well-positioned. I will set L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N=5 to capture the most recent summer demand levels, and sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to reflect current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand further softened in June (Periods 15-17): average declined from ~19 to ~20 with a recent two-week average of 13.5 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This SKU (cotton blend socks) is experiencing a structural decline in demand as summer matures, consistent with typical seasonal patterns for warm-weather footwear. Over the last three periods (16-18), demand has been 15, 12, and 9 units, representing a significant drop from the May average. The last 4 weeks average approximately 17 units, but the last 2 weeks average only 10.5. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling trend while providing enough stock for the 4-period lead time. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods based on the arrival in Period 14. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent window to capture the decreasing volatility. The on-hand (21) and in-transit (68) total 89, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late June: Demand declined from a May average of ~19 to a recent 3-week average of 12 units (Periods 16-18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for cotton socks has hit a seasonal floor, with the last 4 periods (Periods 16-19) showing an average of 10 units/period (15, 12, 9, 4). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 19 already identifies a decline to ~12 units, and the most recent data confirms this downward drift towards the summer minimum. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P15 order arrived at P19). We currently have 21 units on hand and 64 units in transit (ordered in P16, P17, P18). The in-transit inventory covers approximately 6 periods of demand at current levels (~10/wk), so the OR engine will likely order little to nothing. Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the most recent drop to 10 units/period, and N=4 for sigma_hat reflects the current low volatility (std \u2248 4.7).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed for late June (Periods 16-19): average demand declined to 10 units/period (range 4-15), significantly lower than the May average of ~19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Cotton blend socks are in a seasonal demand trough during the summer. Analysis of the last 5 periods (Periods 16-20) shows demands of 15, 12, 9, 4, and 7, averaging 9.4 units per period. This confirms the 'summer demand floor' previously identified in carry-over insights. Recent arrivals (ordered P15 and P16) have consistently followed the promised 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory includes orders from P17 (23 units) and P18 (8 units), totaling 31 units. On-hand inventory is 47. Total inventory position is 78 units, which covers approximately 8.3 weeks of current demand (78 / 9.4). Given the $1/$1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the target service level is 50%, requiring a base stock of roughly (1+L)*mu. With L=4, the required base stock is ~5*9.4 = 47. Since current inventory (78) already exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-week average to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on older, higher-demand periods.

The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in a stable mid-summer demand regime for cotton-blend socks. Demand has settled at a very low floor, averaging 7.25 units over the last 4 periods (Periods 18-21: 9, 4, 7, 9). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on arrivals from orders placed in Period 15, 16, and 17. Current inventory stands at 61 units on-hand with 8 units in-transit (ordered in Period 18, expected arrival in Period 22 conclude). Given the extremely low demand (approx. 7-8 units/period), the total pipeline of 69 units covers nearly 10 periods of supply. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to set a base stock level. By setting \u03bc\u0302 using recent demand (N=5 covers the summer floor) and \u03c3\u0302 similarly, we provide the backend with the correct low-demand context to prevent over-ordering while maintaining high service levels at this seasonality floor.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is the middle of summer. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend' has shifted to a lower summer regime. Analyzed demand for the most recent period (Periods 18-22) shows a stable average of approximately 8 units per period (9, 4, 7, 9, 11). This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 20 indicating a summer floor around 10 units. Forecasted demand is therefore set to 10 units/period. With a Lead Time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * 10 = 50. Given the high on-hand inventory (58) and zero in-transit, the current stock already exceeds the necessary base stock to cover the replenishment cycle. The OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate given the current surplus and high holding costs relative to profit. Parameters are adjusted to reflect the recent N=5 period demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend' is currently in a low-demand regime characteristic of the season. Observed demand over the last 5 periods (Period 19-23) has been 4, 7, 9, 11, and 7 units, respectively, yielding an average of 7.6 units per period. This confirms the 'summer demand floor' identified in the carry-over insights. With an on-hand inventory of 51 units and zero units in transit, the current stock covers approximately 6.7 periods of demand at the current average (51 / 7.6). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and actual lead times have consistently been 4 periods (P15-P18 orders all arrived on time), we are overstocked relative to the (L+1) goal of 5 periods of stock. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this floor and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the current low volatility, allowing inventory to naturally deplete towards the new target level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the height of summer. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend' has reached a seasonal low, consistent with the historical pattern observed in mid-to-late summer. In the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 7.6 units per week (7, 9, 11, 7, 4), which is significantly lower than the May average of ~19 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 units with 0 in-transit. Based on the recent average demand of ~7.6, the current stock (47 units) covers approximately 6 periods of demand. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (total protection needed for 5 periods), the current inventory is sufficient to meet expected demand without placing a new order. The observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. I will set parameters based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect this summer floor and avoid overstocking while holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for cotton-blend socks has settled into a very low summer floor. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25), demand has been 9, 11, 7, 4, and 5 units respectively, averaging 7.2 units per period. This is a further decline from the late June/July average of 10. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 42 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current average (42 / 7.2 \u2248 5.8 periods). Since the system targets (L+1) = 5 periods of stock, we are slightly overstocked but approaching the reorder point. I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low summer demand and set L to default (4) as the supply chain is performing as expected.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor further declined in July/August: Average demand for Periods 21-25 is 7.2 units/period, down from the previous floor of ~10 units/period (Periods 16-19).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which is now in the trough of summer demand. Demand has stabilized at a very low 'summer floor'; the average demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 21-26) is approximately 7.5 units per period (9, 11, 7, 4, 5, 9). Currently, there are 33 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). At the current rate of ~7.5 units/period, the total requirement is approximately 37.5 units. Since we have 33 units on-hand, we are nearly at the target stock level, but a small safety cushion or order might be triggered by the OR backend. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average (recent_N=6) to reflect this persistent low-demand summer regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, late summer. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has been [7, 4, 5, 9, 18], with a noticeable uptick in P27 (18 units), potentially signaling the start of the 'Back to School' season or a transition towards autumn demand for socks. The summer floor (average ~7 units) seems to be ending. I will use a recent_N approach to capture this emerging trend while tempering the volatility of the single-period spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P19-P22). With 15 units on-hand and 5 in-transit (ordered P27), the pipeline of 20 units needs to be assessed against the (L+1=5) period horizon. I will set N=7 to include the low summer baseline and the recent increase, providing a balanced forecast that allows the OR backend to respond to the potential seasonal shift without overreacting to one data point.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand recovery started Period 27 (demand increased from avg ~7 to 18 units), likely signaling the end of the summer low and transition to autumn/Back-to-School demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand for fine-knit cotton socks shows a clear seasonal pattern: high in winter (~78), declining through spring (~38 to ~19), and hitting a summer floor in July/August (~7). However, Period 27 (18 units) and Period 28 (13 units) indicate the beginning of a recovery, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' and the transition to autumn. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), with 22 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 27 and 28). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, these arrivals are expected in Period 31 and 32. With demand trending upward, I must set parameters to ensure availability as we enter the higher-demand autumn season. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent recovery trend (Avg: 13.3) and set lead time to 'calculate' to rely on observed performance (consistently 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand recovery detected starting Period 27: Average demand increased from summer floor (~7 units) to ~13 units (average Periods 27-28), signaling a return to pre-summer levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are seeing a sustained recovery in demand as we transition into the Autumn season (Back-to-School/Fall). Demand for the last three periods (27-29) has been 18, 13, and 14 units, averaging 15 units per period. This is a significant increase from the summer floor of approximately 7 units. At the start of Period 30, we have 0 units on-hand and 43 units in-transit (orders from P27, P28, and P29). These orders are expected to arrive in Periods 31, 32, and 33 respectively, based on the reliable lead time of 4. Since the current on-hand is 0 and demand is trending upwards towards 15+ units, the pipeline (43 units) covers approximately three periods of demand at the new rate. To ensure we meet the rising demand and maintain the safety stock requested by the OR backend (base stock for L+1 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this autumn recovery (average 15 * 5 = 75) and using calculate for L as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand recovery sustained: Average demand for Periods 27-29 is 15.0 units, up from the summer floor of ~7 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a confirmed 'Back-to-School/Autumn' demand recovery phase. In Period 30, demand spiked to 34 units, significantly higher than the previous summer floor (~7) and the early August recovery (~15). This spike confirms that demand is returning towards early-year levels as the weather cools (fine-knit socks). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 63 units in-transit. The 63 units in-transit are the orders from Periods 27 (5), 28 (17), 29 (21), and 30 (20). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, the P27 order (5 units) will arrive in Period 31, P28 (17) in Period 32, and so on. Total pipeline (63) + expected new order must cover the lead time (4) + review period (1). Given the recent demand jump to 34, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this upward shift (Average P27-P30: 19.75). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 will project approximately 100 units needed for the 5-period window (5 * 20), which will trigger an order to supplement the 63 in-transit and 0 on-hand, accounting for the likely stockout-affected historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand acceleration confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 34 units, indicating a faster recovery than initially observed in Periods 27-29 (avg 15). Transitioning back to higher inventory levels to match early-year demand (~30-50 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn 'Back-to-School' and transition season. As of Period 32 (Sept 16), demand has accelerated significantly over the last three periods: 14 units (P29), 34 units (P30), and 39 units (P31). This confirms the demand recovery noted in carry-over insights. We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite some arrivals, because the surge exceeded previous forecasts. Pipeline inventory is healthy (94 units) with substantial orders from Periods 28-31 expected to arrive in Periods 32-35. Given the clear upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the accelerated average demand of ~29 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration sustained: Average demand for Periods 29-31 is 29.0 units, a significant increase from the early recovery phase (~15 units). Currently in a seasonal ramp-up phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Autumn/Back-to-School season (late September), which has triggered a sharp demand spike. Recent demand (Periods 30-32) has surged to 34, 39, and 53 units, far exceeding the summer floor of ~7 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 128 units in-transit (orders from Periods 29-32). To prevent continued stockouts, mu_hat must reflect this new seasonal regime. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent accelerating demand (average ~42 units/period). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 31 and 32).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School surge confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~15 units (Periods 27-29) to ~42 units (Periods 30-32), representing a significant seasonal regime shift.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth phase as demand for cotton socks surges during the transition into autumn and the approach of winter. Demand has accelerated significantly from an average of ~15 units (Periods 27-29) to ~42 units (Periods 30-32), with Period 33 hitting a peak of 93 units. This suggests we are entering a peak seasonal regime similar to the start of the year (Periods 1-3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing stockouts (sold=21 with demand=93 in Period 33). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 260. This represents an average of 52 units per period over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), reflecting the recent acceleration while providing a buffer for continued seasonal growth. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility during this transition. This strategy aims to build back the pipeline inventory and increase future on-hand availability.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak regime confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~42 units (late Sept) to 93 units in Period 33, indicating a return to high-volume winter seasonality.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth seasonal ramp-up phase for cotton socks as we move into October and the winter peak. Demand has surged from a summer low of ~7 units to 108 units in Period 34. To capture this growth, I am basing mu_hat on the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods: 53, 93, 108), which averages approximately 85 units per period. Setting N=3 for mu_hat captures this acceleration while avoiding underweighting the recent triples-digit peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to recent arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the surge, and we have 240 units in-transit (orders from P31-P34). The OR engine needs to prioritize inventory accumulation to avoid further stockouts during this peak seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Winter peak demand confirmed and accelerating. Average demand for Periods 32-34 is 84.7 units, reaching a high of 108 in Period 34, a significant jump from the September average (~42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a significant winter peak demand regime for cotton socks. Demand has surged from ~30-50 units in early September to over 100 units in the last two periods (P34: 108, P35: 113). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and all recent demand has been lost, indicating we are under-ordered for the actual seasonal peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a 3-period average (P33-P35) to set mu_hat at ~105 units/period, resulting in an explicit value of 525 (105 * 5). This aggressive stocking is necessary because the profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level (0.5 critical ratio, but high demand variance and zero current stock justify a more robust base stock) and the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will prevent excessive over-ordering. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of this high-demand period to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand stabilized above 100 units/period (average P34-P35: 110.5), significantly higher than the previous autumn average of ~85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks continues to experience a significant seasonal surge as we enter the peak winter period. Demand has averaged 115 units over the last three periods (P34-P36), exceeding the previous autumn average (~85). Currently, on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and we are experiencing lost sales despite significant volume in-transit (408 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To restore service levels and capture this high-volume demand, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized peak demand (average ~115). Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for heightened volatility during the surge. This conservative approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 100+ units/period regime while managing the 4-period pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand sustains growth: Average demand for Periods 34-36 escalated to 115.7 units/period, up from the early-October average of ~85.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter demand regime for cotton socks. Demand has stabilized at a high level, with a 3-week average (P35-37) of 123 units/period. The system is currently stock-out constrained (on-hand is 0, arriving inventory is immediately sold), indicating that our pipeline is finally catching up but the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend likely restricted order sizes in previous periods. Since lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to set mu_hat to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3-period average of 123 units gives a base demand forecast. To ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders to break the stock-out cycle and meet this sustained peak, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand intensity, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand stabilized at ~123 units/period (average Periods 35-37), significantly higher than the early-October ramp-up.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand winter peak regime, with the most recent week showing 101 units of demand (Period 38). Over the last four weeks (Periods 35-38), demand has averaged 117.5 units, significantly higher than the previous autumn average. Despite consistent 4-period lead times, the fast ramp-up has caused persistent stockouts due to the pipeline delay. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 521 units in-transit. An arrival of 132 units (ordered Period 35) is expected in Period 39. To stabilize service levels during this seasonal high, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-week window (N=4) to capture the current plateau of ~118 units/period. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand plateau confirmed: Average demand for Periods 35-38 reached ~118 units/period, establishing a high-season baseline for November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) shows a notable drop in demand to 71 units, down from the October average of ~118 units. This could signal the passing of a localized seasonal peak or a temporary dip before the late-year holidays. However, given the product (cotton socks) and the 'Winter peak demand' regime identified in carry-over insights, I will treat this cautiously. The current on-hand inventory is 61, with a massive pipeline of 456 units (mostly orders from Periods 36-38 designed to cover ~120 units/period). My goal is to prevent a massive inventory build-up if the demand has truly peaked. Comparing the last 4 periods (113, 126, 130, 101, 71), the average is ~108. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this slight softening while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected in early November: Period 39 demand (71) is significantly lower than the October average (~118), suggesting a potential transition from the peak winter regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the product (cotton blend socks) is entering the late autumn/early winter phase. Historical data and recent observations show a clear regime shift: demand peaked in October (avg ~118) and has softened in November (Period 39: 71, Period 40: 87). This suggests the peak 'stock-up' period for winter has passed, and demand is settling into a more moderate winter baseline. Period 40's demand (87) was higher than Period 39 (71), but both are significantly below the October highs. The current on-hand inventory (97) and large pipeline (357) are more than sufficient to cover this lower demand regime across the lead time. I am using recent_N=2 for mu_hat to capture this post-peak softening (averaging ~79 units/period) to prevent further over-ordering, as the holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.00), making overstocking as punitive as lost sales. L remains at default (4) as arrivals are consistent and on time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime transitioned from October peak (~118 units/period) to a softer November baseline (average Periods 39-40: 79 units/period), a ~33% reduction from peak winter demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has transitioned from the October peak (~118 units/period) to a stabilized November level. The last three periods (P39-P41) show demand of 71, 87, and 92 units, averaging 83.3 units. This confirms the 'softer November baseline' noted in previous insights. Currenly, on-hand inventory is 136 and in-transit (pipeline) is 226 (consisting of orders from P38, P39, and P40), totaling 362 units. With the promised lead time of 4 and an average demand of ~83, the required base stock (L+1 periods) is approximately 415. However, since we are approaching the end of the year (P42 of 47) and observing a shift away from peak levels, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this stabilized November demand (avg ~83) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime stabilized: Average demand for Periods 39-41 is 83.3 units/period, confirming a ~30% reduction from the October peak average of ~118.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has transitioned from an October peak (~118 units/period) to a stabilized November/early December regime. For Periods 39-42, demand was 71, 87, 92, and 127. While P42 showed a jump to 127, the 4-period average is 94.25 units. We are currently entering December (P43 starts 2019/12/02), which typically maintains high winter demand before the late-month holiday tail-off. However, because on-hand inventory (144) and in-transit (146, from P39 order of 67, P40 of 24, P41 of 0, and P42 of 55) are relatively high compared to the current average, the goal is to maintain a stable base stock without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (P47). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand level (~94 units/period), as the historical mean is skewed by summer lows and October highs.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime stabilization: Average demand for Periods 39-42 is 94.25 units/period, reflecting a transition from the mid-October peak to a sustained high-winter level for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand history shows a volatile winter regime: October peak (~118), November softening (~83), and a strong Period 42 (127) followed by a drop in Period 43 (65). The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) is 88.4 units. Since we are in the peak December shopping season for socks, I will use recent_N=5 to capture this high-volume winter baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple recent arrivals). Inventory is currently healthy (On-hand: 146, In-transit: 213), but we must maintain stock for the final few periods of the year which often see high holiday demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for December (Periods 43-44) is averaging 74.5 units, which is slightly lower than the early November average (~83) but consistent with a high-winter baseline. The 'Cotton blend socks' product description and late December date suggest that demand will remain robust through the holiday season but may begin to decline sharply in January. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods throughout the game. With 272 units in-transit (orders from P42-P44) and 86 on-hand, our pipeline is well-stocked. To maintain service levels while hedging against the post-holiday January drop-off, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-week average (approx 92 units/period) to reflect current winter levels, but keep L at default to avoid over-ordering as the game nears its end (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: December demand regime established: Average demand for Periods 41-44 is approximately 92 units/period, maintaining high winter levels before the expected post-holiday January decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the post-holiday January decline. Demand remains in the 'winter high' regime (avg ~90 units), but the Period 45 'conclude' message shows a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0) despite a starting inventory of 86 and demand of 96. Crucially, the order from Period 41 (due this period) has not yet been confirmed in a 'conclude' message, and 'In-transit' is 374, covering orders from P41 (0 units), P42 (55 units), P43 (134 units), P44 (83 units), and P45 (102 units). While no arrival was recorded in Period 45 (since no order was placed in P41), we must prepare for the seasonal decline typical of post-Christmas (January). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high demand (~92 avg) while the OR backend's cap and the looming seasonal shift will naturally moderate the order size. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as shipments have been arriving at the promised 4-period interval.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, representing the post-holiday period. Demand in Period 46 was 72 units, confirming a softening from the December peak (~92 units) identified in previous periods. Since the inventory position is currently 0 on-hand and 409 in-transit, and the simulation is at its final period (47), I will set parameters to maintain a steady flow based on recent softened demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P46 saw arrival of P42 order). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the transition from mid-December peak to late-December softening (Avg ~83), which provides a more accurate base for the OR backend than the long-term historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening confirmed in late December (Period 46 demand: 72), indicating a decline from the early December average of ~92 units/period.
