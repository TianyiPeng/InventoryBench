Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is a wardrobe staple (Divided Basics). Historical demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows a significant upward trend: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62. This suggests a post-holiday ramp-up or a new product launch phase. The mean of all 5 samples is 32.4, but the most recent figure is 62. Given the strong growth (regime shift), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher recent demand (avg 32, 49, 62 = 47.6). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed history yet, L is set to 'default'. Sigma will use 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increasing volatility seen during this growth phase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Long T-shirt (Jersey Basic), which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62, and most recently 38 (though 38 was 'demand' in P1, it resulted in 0 sales due to 0 on-hand inventory). The average demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 45 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order placed in Period 1 (73 units) is in transit and won't arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest), we need to ensure our base stock covers the lead time + 1 period (L+1 = 5 periods). A mu_hat based on the recent trend (N=4) captures the current growth phase better than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect current volatility. We use 'default' for L as there is no evidence yet to override the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing a Jersey Basic Long T-shirt. Historical demand shows a steady upward trend: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62 (pre-game) and 38, 73 (game periods). Average demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 55.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 140 units (73 ordered P1, 67 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 arrival resolution (visible in P6). To capture the recent accelerating trend while acknowledging seasonality (Spring buildup for basics), I will use the last 4 demand samples (49, 62, 38, 73, mean=55.5) as my forecast base. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to explicit 277.5 (5 * 55.5), and sigma_hat to explicit 40 to account for the high volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand has been increasing (6, 13, 32, 49, 62) leading up to Period 1, followed by demand observations in Periods 1-3 of 38, 73, and 52 respectively. The prometon lead time is 4 periods. Since we started in Period 1, no arrivals are expected until Period 5 (at the earliest). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 225 units in-transit (73 from P1, 67 from P2, 85 from P3). Demand seems to have stabilized around an average of 57 over the last 5 samples (49, 62, 38, 73, 52). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using N=5 for the demand forecast captures this recent regime. We use 'default' for L since no orders have concluded yet to suggest a change from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. We are managing a Long T-shirt (711053004). Historical demand provided (Jan to early Feb) showed a steady climb from 6 to 62 units. Game history (Feb 11 to Mar 4) shows demand fluctuated (38, 73, 52, 30), averaging approximately 48 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this period) and will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message. Consequently, on-hand remains 0 for now, and we have 274 units in transit (73+67+85+49). Demand is currently outstripping zero on-hand supply, causing lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent game-period demand mean (~48.25) and volatility. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, I'll stick with the default lead time. mu_hat will be estimated as (1+L)*mean of last 4 periods \u2248 5 * 48.25 = 241.25.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is a stable basic item. Demand history shows values: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62 (pre-game) and 38, 73, 52, 30, 37 (in-game). The demand spiked in late January/early February and has since stabilized to a mean of approximately 45 units over the last 5 periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, we have 36 units on-hand and 201 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning we want the base stock to align closely with the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable regime (~45 units/period) and 'default' for lead time since the promised 4 periods is being met. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The product is a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey', which is a spring/summer wardrobe basic. Since mid-February (Period 2), demand has stabilized significantly after an initial spike (73 in P2). The last four periods (P3-P6) show demand of 52, 30, 37, 39, averaging 39.5 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). We currently have 64 units on hand and 134 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). To balance inventory for the upcoming Spring season (typically higher demand for T-shirts), I will use the recent demand trend (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the confirmed lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 arrival at P5; P2 arrival at P6). Demand regime stabilized around 40 units/period after Period 2 peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (T-shirt) has shown a demand regime shift. After an initial spike in Period 2 (73 units), demand has stabilized over the last five periods (P3-P7: 52, 30, 37, 39, 24) with an average of approximately 36.4 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 (all tracking back 4 periods). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 125 units, and there is one remaining shipment of 49 units (from P4) in-transit, expected to arrive during the resolution of the current period. To prevent overstocking given high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the stabilized lower demand levels and ensuring the lead time remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~36 units/period (P3-P7) following early Feb peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU (a jersey long T-shirt) shows a stable demand regime following an early February peak. Over the last 6 periods (P3-P8), the average demand has been 36.6 units per period (52, 30, 37, 39, 24, 38). The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed for P1 through P4 orders). Inventory levels are currently high at 136 units due to large orders placed in P1-P3, which exceeded the realized demand of ~37. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), the backend logic (q = 0.5, z* = 0) will naturally aim for a lean base stock. I will use the recent 6 periods to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid the pull of the early P1-P2 peaks, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic long T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in early Feb (73 units) and has since stabilized. The last 5 periods (P5-P9) show demands of 37, 39, 24, 38, 31, averaging 33.8 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on clear evidence from P5-P8. Currently, we have 105 units on-hand and 48 units in-transit (8 from P8, 40 from P9). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods @ 33.8/period is ~169 units. Pipeline inventory (105 on-hand + 48 in-transit) is 153. Using recent_N=5 for demand and L=4 addresses the stabilization and confirms the supply chain timing.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower level post-spring peak; avg demand (P5-P9) is 33.8 units/period, down from earlier averages.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current date is April 22, 2019. The demand in Period 10 spiked to 76 units, which is significantly higher than the stable range of 31-39 units observed between Periods 5-9. This spike likely reflects a seasonal demand shift as we enter late April/May for this T-shirt SKU. On-hand inventory has dropped to 29 units, and there are 64 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, and P10). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived in 4 periods). Given the sudden demand spike in P10, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will calculate mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 6-10) to incorporate the recent spike while acknowledging the baseline, resulting in an average demand of approximately 42 units per period. With L=4 (promised/actual), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods, so mu_hat is set to roughly 210. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 10 (76 units), ending the previous stable regime of ~34 units/period. Monitoring to see if this reflects a sustained seasonal shift for late spring.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is entering late spring/early summer, and we are seeing a significant demand surge. In Period 10, demand jumped to 76, and in Period 11, it reached 93, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The previous stable regime of ~34 units/period is no longer applicable. The average of the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is 66.7 units/period, while the last 2 (the surge) average 84.5 units/period. Given the approach to warmer weather for a short-sleeve T-shirt, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture this upward shift while avoiding over-reacting to a single spike. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods consistently. Currently, On-hand is 0 with 139 units in-transit (ordered in P8, P9, P10, P11), and the P8 order (8 units) should arrive this period, though it won't be enough to satisfy the current 80+ unit demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Seasonal surge for T-shirt started Period 10; demand increased from ~34 to 84.5 avg in last 2 periods (+148%). Stockout occurred Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a seasonal demand surge for the 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt), likely tied to the warming weather in May. Demand in the last three periods (P10-P12) has been 76, 93, and 53, averaging 74 units/period, compared to the previous stable regime of ~34. Due to this surge and the 4-period lead time, we have experienced stockouts in P11 and P12. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline (251 units) contains orders from P9 (40), P10 (16), P11 (75), and P12 (120). The P9 order is expected to arrive this period (P13), which will help resolve the stockout. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we are in a high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the surge and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for roughly 5 periods (L+1) of this elevated demand (~370 units).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal surge confirmed for May: Avg demand elevated to ~74 units/period (P10-P12) from previous benchmark of ~34.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is exhibiting high demand volatility as we enter the summer season. Period 10-11 saw a massive spike (76-93 units), followed by a lower demand of 39 units in Period 13, which might reflect the stockout's dampening effect or natural variation within the new high-demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm a seasonal shift for May with an average demand of ~74 units/period (Periods 10-12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 1 unit on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 319 units (including Period 10's 16 units arriving next period), the system is recovering from stockouts in Periods 11 and 12. To handle the high variability and ensure availability during the seasonal peak, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4, Periods 10-13) which captures the shift, resulting in an average of (76+93+53+39)/4 = 65.25 units per period. I'm using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat as well to reflect the increased forecast uncertainty/volatility of this peak period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is seasonally relevant for late spring/early summer. Demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 10 (mid-April), coinciding with warmer weather. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), average demand has been (76+93+53+39+39)/5 = 60 units/period, despite stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 14 limiting observed sales. The last two periods (P13-P14) settled at 39 units/period, but this likely represents a supply-constrained environment rather than a drop in true demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 310 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14 expected in P15, P16, P17, P18 respectively). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given Profit=HoldingCost=1, the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the seasonal uplift since P10 (avg ~60), while maintaining the established lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand plateau confirmed: After an initial April peak (90+ units), May demand has stabilized around ~60 units/period (average adjusted for stockouts), significantly higher than the spring baseline of 34.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 16). The product is a short-sleeved cotton T-shirt, which sees high demand during the warmer months. Historically, we saw a surge in demand starting in Period 10 (April 15), likely a spring/summer transition. While demand peaked at 93 in Period 11, the last few periods (13-15) show a stabilization at a lower but still significant level (demand of 39, 39, and 38). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods consistently. Currently, on-hand inventory is 37 and we have 235 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14). The order from Period 12 (120 units) is expected to arrive during the next period (Period 16) and will be visible at the start of Period 17. The carry-over insights correctly identified a plateau of ~60, but recent raw demand indicates a slightly cooler trend around 38-40 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (Periods 10-15) to capture the elevated summer regime while tempering the extreme peaks with the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use the last 6 periods to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau stabilized: Demand has settled at ~40 units/period (P13-P15) following the April surge, maintaining a higher level than the early spring baseline of 34.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is a short-sleeved cotton T-shirt, which is currently entering its peak summer season (June 3rd). A significant demand surge was observed in Period 16 (86 units), echoing the surge seen in Period 11 (93 units). These peaks suggest that demand is volatile but tends towards higher values during warm months. The current 'summer plateau' described in previous insights (~40 units/period) appears to be an underestimate given the most recent 86-unit observation. I am updating \u03bc\u0302 to reflect a higher average demand for the upcoming lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 13-16) to capture the recent volatility and higher mean (avg ~50.5 units/period), providing enough stock to cover another potential 80-90 unit week while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility confirmed: Demand fluctuates between ~40 and ~85 units as of early June (Periods 13-16), indicating higher risk of stockout if using only the 40-unit baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Period 17 showed an extreme demand spike of 180 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This follows a pattern of high summer volatility (40 to 180 units in the last 5 periods). Looking at historical data for Periods 13-17, the average demand is (39+39+38+86+180)/5 = 76.4 units. Given this SKU is a T-shirt entering peak summer (June), demand is likely to remain high and volatile. We have 0 on-hand and 74 in-transit (orders from P14=7, P16=10, P17=57). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since demand just hit a maximum, I will set mu_hat based on the recent elevated regime (N=5) to capture the higher mean (76.4), and use explicit sigma to account for the heavy-tailed risk seen in Period 17 (std of last 5 periods is ~60, which suggests high volatility). The OR backend uses a 50% service level target (q=P/(P+H) = 0.5), so mu_hat must be robust to avoid chronic stockouts during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike detected Period 17 (180 units), indicating high summer volatility and potential for stockouts if using averages below 75 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is currently in its peak summer season (June). Period 17 saw an extreme demand spike of 180 units, and Period 18 saw 141 units, both resulting in stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Given the high summer volatility and recent stockouts, I need to significantly increase the forecast to prevent further lost sales during this peak period. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is (86+180+141)/3 = 135.6 units. To cover the 5-period window (L+1), I will use an explicit mu_hat based on this high-demand regime (~135 * 5 = 675). Sigma_hat is also set high explicitly to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 86 to 180). Pipeline inventory is 243, so a high base stock will trigger the necessary large replenishment.

Carry-over insight: High summer demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 16-18 reached ~136 units/period, a significant increase from the previous May/early June volatility. Seasonal peak for T-shirts is now in full effect.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24) continues the high-demand summer regime for this jersey T-shirt. Demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) has been 180, 141, and 187, averaging approximately 169.3 units/period, which significantly exceeds the previous average of ~136 noted in Carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 459 units, but current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product's high seasonal sensitivity during late June, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this peak demand level (approx 169 units/period * 5 periods = 845). This ensures the base stock level targets the peak seasonal demand to mitigate stockout risk during June/July.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Average demand for P17-P19 increased to ~169 units/period, up from previous plateau of ~136 (+24%), representing the full summer peak for T-shirts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand observations for Periods 17-20 are 180, 141, 187, and 147 respectively, yielding an average of approximately 164 units per period. This represents a significant sustained increase from the late spring period. The current 'On-hand' inventory is depleted (0), and while there is a large 'In-transit' pipeline of 660 units, the system must maintain a high base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). At an average demand of ~164, the 5-period requirement is approximately 820 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P16 order arrived at P20). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this specific summer peak regime, ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated from this high-demand window (P17-P20).

Carry-over insight: High summer demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 17-20 is ~164 units/period, solidifying the seasonal peak for this garment category.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand regime for this t-shirt (SKU 711053004). The carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 17-21) show a dramatic demand increase, with the average demand over the last four periods being approximately 170.5 units (180, 141, 187, 147, 167). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand 0 at the end of Period 21), meaning actual demand likely exceeds the observed sales. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the high demand during the summer peak, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this regime shift. This will set a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts during the peak July season, while accounting for the established lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand maintained: Average demand for Periods 17-21 is approximately 170 units/period, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for the summer months.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the peak summer season for the 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt), which has shown a high-demand regime since late June. The average demand for the last five periods (P18-P22) is (141+187+147+167+103)/5 = 149 units. However, looking specifically at the peak window (P17-P21), the average was approximately 170 units. Recent P22 demand (103) shows a slight cooling, but we must maintain stock for the sustained summer peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With only 73 units on-hand and 646 in pipeline, and the backend applying a cap based on (1+L) demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the sustained peak average. I'll use recent_N with N=5 (P18-P22) to capture the shift from the extreme spike (P17) to the current plateau while staying responsive to the high summer volume.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. This SKU is a 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt), which has experienced a significant summer peak. The Carry-over Insights for Period 22 noted a summer peak mean of approximately 170 units/period. However, the most recent two periods (P22-P23) have shown a decline in demand (103 and 76 units respectively), which suggests the peak may be starting to taper off as we move further into late July. Using the long-term summer average (P17-P23) gives a mean of ~143, while the last 5 periods (P19-P23) average ~136. To avoid over-ordering during a potential seasonal decline while still protecting against volatility (as seen in Period 17 and 19), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the broader summer behavior (~143 units/period). This setting balances the sustained high demand of earlier weeks with the recent lower observations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand showing signs of tapering in late July (P22: 103, P23: 76) compared to the June/early July average of ~170. Demand regime mean for the full summer peak (P17-P23) is ~143.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, late summer. Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate that the extreme summer peak (June/early July) is beginning to taper off. Demand in Period 22 was 103, Period 23 was 76, and Period 24 spiked back to 188. This indicates high end-of-season volatility. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 149 units per period, while the last 3 periods (P22-P24) average 122 units. Given that this is a T-shirt SKU, we expect demand to decline further as we move into August/September. Using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat captures the high summer mean while beginning to factor in the tapering. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand (236) and in-transit (291) inventory totaling 527 units, and target base stock (L+1=5) likely around 600-750, the backend OR will likely place a moderate order to maintain stock without over-ordering as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand volatility confirmed: Late July demand fluctuating significantly (P22: 103, P23: 76, P24: 188) as the peak season begins to taper.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th. Looking at the history, the summer peak (June/July) for this T-shirt SKU appears to be transitioning into late-summer volatility. Demand over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has been 103, 76, 188, and 107. While the average during the core peak (P17-P21) was ~164, the average of the most recent 4 periods is ~118.5. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use the last 7 periods (P19-P25) to capture both the peak and the start of the taper. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting OR parameters with recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the backend to adjust the base stock to these high-volume levels while accounting for the high standard deviation observed in July, ensuring we maintain a sufficient service level for any final August bursts.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from high summer peak (~164 avg) to late-summer volatility in Period 22; average demand for P22-P25 is 118.5 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey', which is past its peak summer season (June/July). Historical demand confirms a transition from the summer peak (approx. 164 units/period) to a lower, more volatile late-summer regime. Specifically, the average demand from Period 22 to 26 is 110.4 units, significantly lower than the June average but still relatively high. The most recent demand (P26) was 78, following 107 in P25, suggesting a continued taper as we approach late August. On-hand inventory is 270 with 349 in-transit, totaling 619 units of pipeline inventory. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering Periods 22-26) captures the post-peak mean of ~110 units. However, to account for the downward trend observed in the last two weeks (78, 107) and the seasonal nature of T-shirts in mid-August, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect a slightly more conservative estimate of 90 units per period (450 for 5 periods) to avoid excessive holding costs as the season ends. Lead time L remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from high summer peak (~164 avg) to late-summer taper starting Period 22; average demand for P22-P26 is 110.4 units/period, with a clear downward trend in the most recent two weeks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The SKU is a T-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late August. Demand has transitioned from a high summer peak (~164 avg) to a late-summer taper starting around Period 22. Average demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) is 105.6 units/period, while the most recent two periods (P26, P27) are lower at 78 and 79 units respectively. Given this clear downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P23-P27) to capture this mean of ~106. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P23 order arrived in P27). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the volatility during this tapering phase, which includes a spike in P24.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Late-summer regime (P23-P27) average demand is 105.6 units/period, down from the summer peak of ~164 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in the late-summer taper for the 'Tess Tee' (T-shirt). Demand has consistently decreased from the summer peak (avg ~164) to a lower regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P23-P28) is 105.6, 76, 188, 107, 78, 79, and 65. The most recent three periods (P26-P28) show a mean of 74 units. Given this is a seasonal item entering late August/early September, I expect demand to continue returning toward the baseline. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the trend of approximately 81 units/period while maintaining responsiveness to the recent dip to 65. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen in late July (P24). On-hand inventory is healthy (198) and in-transit (277) is high due to a large order in P25, so the backend and 'cap' logic will likely result in a zero or small order to avoid excess holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand taper continues: average demand for P26-P28 is 74 units/period, down significantly from the summer peak as seasonal relevance for t-shirts declines.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 2nd, and historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (711053004) shows a clear seasonal taper as summer ends. The high summer peak (avg ~164 units) has concluded. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) show demand of 79, 65, and 61 units respectively, confirming a new lower regime. The average of these last three periods is approximately 68 units/period, down significantly from the summer highs. On-hand inventory is currently high (354 units) following a large arrival from the P25 order (217 units), which is enough to cover over 5 periods of current demand levels. With 102 units still in-transit (orders from P26 and P29), and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0 (implying a 50% target service level), the priority is reducing inventory to avoid excessive holding costs during the seasonal decline. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current tapering demand (~68.3 per period) and sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the tail-end of summer volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped to an average of ~68 units/period (P27-P29) following the summer peak, reflecting declining seasonal relevance for T-shirts in September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering early September (2019-09-09). The product is a T-shirt, which is past its peak summer season. Demand history shows a steady decline from the mid-summer peak (~170 units) to a stabilized post-summer regime. The last four periods (P27-P30) have seen demand of 79, 65, 61, and 62, averaging ~67 units/period. The carry-over insights confirm this taper. On-hand inventory is currently high at 352 units, which is significantly more than our expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods * 67 units = 335). There is also an in-transit order of 42 units due in Period 33 (ordered P29). Since current inventory levels already cover the forecasted demand plus a safety margin, the OR backend should minimize further ordering to avoid excess holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the stable 67-unit average, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this post-peak phase.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. The SKU is a t-shirt, which has moved past its summer peak (P17-P22 average ~164) into a clear late-summer/early-autumn taper. The demand for the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) is 79, 65, 61, 62, and 107, averaging 74.8 units/period. The spike to 107 in P31 is likely late-season volatility rather than a new upward trend, as t-shirt demand typically declines as autumn progresses. On-hand inventory is high at 245 units due to large previous arrivals (P25 order of 217 units arrived in P29). With a lead time of 4 periods and a service level q = 0.5 (since profit $1 = holding cost $1), the base stock goal is simply the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Current on-hand (245) + in-transit (42) = 287, which covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand at the current average. Given the downward seasonal trend, holding excess inventory is risky. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the 74.8 average) to reflect the post-peak environment while acknowledging the P31 volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Sept/Oct established: average demand (P27-P31) is 74.8 units/period, roughly 45% of the summer peak level.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the 'Tess Tee' (T-shirt). Carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 27-32) confirm that demand has stabilized at a lower level following the summer peak, with an average of approximately 75 units per period. The most recent demand (P31: 107, P32: 76) shows some residual volatility, but the overall trend is a significant reduction from the ~164 units/period seen in June/July. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (last arrival confirmed at P30, matching P26 order). With 169 units on hand and 129 in transit (ordered in P29 and P32), the pipeline is reasonably stocked for the current 75-unit demand level. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the post-summer regime (P27-P32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this period encapsulates the shift to autumn demand and provides a balanced mean (avg ~75) and standard deviation for the backend OR engine to compute the base stock. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the stable historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P27-P32) average demand is 75 units/period, down from peak of 164. Volatility remains moderate (std dev ~18).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are managing a long T-shirt (711053004), which has exited its summer peak and is now in a post-summer demand regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P27-P33) is approximately 75.8 units/period, showing a significantly lower but stable level compared to the summer peak (avg ~164). Recent demand (P31: 107, P32: 76, P33: 81) fluctuates around this 75-80 unit mark. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P29 order arrived at P33). We have 130 units on-hand and 164 in-transit (orders from P32 and P33). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a target of ~76 units/period, the total requirement is approx 380 units. Currently, on-hand + in-transit = 294, suggesting a need for more inventory to maintain buffers against volatility (std dev ~18 in this regime). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this post-summer stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P27-P33) has reached a stable plateau of ~76 units/period, down from the summer peak of ~164 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is currently in a post-summer demand taper. Demand for the last 8 periods (since September) has averaged ~73 units/period, down significantly from the summer peak of ~164. Most recently, Period 34 saw a dip to 39 units, but this follows a spike to 81/107 earlier in the month, suggesting continued volatility around a lower mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 91 and in-transit at 250, we have 341 units to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). Given it is October, I anticipate demand will continue to stay at or below the currently established post-summer plateau of ~75 units/period. The OR backend will use recent_N=8 to capture this post-summer regime (P27-P34), which covers the transition and current stabilized level.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P27-P34) average demand is 71.4 units/period, showing seasonal T-shirt decline heading into October.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this long T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P34: 39, P35: 38) shows a significant further drop from the September average of ~75, suggesting that as autumn progresses, T-shirt demand is tapering further. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent deceleration (average ~53 units/period) rather than the higher September plateau. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (confirming L=4). Current on-hand is 53, with 266 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34). The upcoming arrivals from P32 (87 units) and P33 (77 units) arriving in P36 and P37 respectively will sufficiently cover the current demand trend. Lowering mu_hat and sigma_hat prevents the OR backend from over-ordering during this seasonal decline, helping to manage holding costs as the product's relevance decreases.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand taper accelerated in October (Period 34); demand dropped from ~75 to ~38 units/period (-50%) corresponding with autumnal seasonality.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is a 'Long T-shirt', which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand decline as of October (Period 34). Demand has dropped from a stable post-summer plateau of ~75 units/period to an average of 37.3 units over the last three periods (P34-P36). This aligns with the transition into late autumn/winter for a basic garment. The on-hand inventory is currently 105 units, and there are 179 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35). Specifically, the P33 order of 77 units is expected to arrive this period (P37), followed by 86 units in P38. Given the current inventory levels and the clear downward trend in demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent local average (~37 units). This will signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering and bleed off the existing surplus, avoiding unnecessary holding costs during the off-season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand taper accelerated in October (Period 34); demand dropped from ~75 to ~37.3 units/period average (P34-P36) reflecting late autumn seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a late autumn regime for 'Tess Tee' (a t-shirt), characterized by a significant demand drop compared to the summer peak. Following the carry-over insight from Period 36/37, a regime shift occurred at Period 34, with average demand dropping from ~75 to ~43.75 units/period (P34-P37: 39, 38, 35, 63). The most recent demand of 63 is slightly higher but still fits the lower autumn profile. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the current on-hand (119) plus in-transit (102) inventory totaling 221 units, we are well-covered for approximately 5 periods of demand (~221 / 44 \u2248 5.0). Therefore, I am setting parameters to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime (N=4) to prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (late autumn) stabilized at ~44 units/period (P34-P37) following the Oct 1st drop, significantly lower than the ~75 units/period seen in early autumn.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a late autumn demand regime for the 'Tess Tee' (a long T-shirt). Demand has significantly tapered from the summer peak (~164) and the early autumn level (~75) to a new stable average of approximately 41.4 units/period over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). Specifically, demand in the last three periods has been 35, 63, and 41. On-hand inventory is currently high at 164 units because orders placed during the 75-unit regime (P32-P34) have arrived. These 164 units cover nearly 4 periods of the current ~41-unit demand. With 16 units in-transit (arriving P39), total coverage is ~180 units. Since current holdings already exceed the estimated base stock needed to cover demand over the lead time (L=4), I will set parameters to stop new orders and allow inventory to bleed down, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for late-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn regime (Nov) confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~41.4 units/period (P34-P38), down from the ~75 units/period early autumn (Sept) average.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late autumn demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P34-P39) has averaged 39.5 units/period, significantly lower than the ~75 units/period seen in early autumn and the ~164 units/period during the summer peak. The most recent demand was 21 units, reinforcing a continuing downward trend as winter approaches. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 159, with 36 units in-transit (ordered P39, expected P43). Current inventory levels are high relative to the present demand regime (159 on-hand covers ~4 weeks of demand at the 40-unit average). I will set mu_hat to reflect this late-autumn level using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (tracking from P34 when the taper started) to avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline while maintaining a buffer for late-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand regime (Period 34 to 39) confirmed at ~39.5 units/period, down from the early autumn (Sept) average of ~75 and much lower than the summer peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand for this long T-shirt SKU has entered a late-autumn/winter trough. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) is approximately 33.1 units, but the most recent two periods show a further drop to 15-21 units, indicating the seasonal decline is intensifying. Current on-hand inventory (144) is very high relative to this demand, covering over 4 periods of supply by itself. Combined with the 39 units in-transit (orders from P39 and P40), we have adequate stock to meet the next 5-6 weeks of demand without new significant orders. Therefore, mu_hat is being adjusted downwards using recent_N=7 to reflect the lower autumn baseline (approx 33 units/period), and sigma_hat is set to capture the moderate volatility observed during this taper. The lead time L remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand trough confirmed: average demand for Periods 37-40 dropped to ~35 units/period, with the most recent two weeks (P39-P40) averaging only 18 units, reflecting minimal seasonal relevance for t-shirts in mid-November.

Demand over the last five periods (P37-P41) has been 63, 41, 21, 15, and 32, with an average of 34.4 units/period. The most recent three periods (P39-P41) average even lower at 22.7 units. With 112 units on-hand and 39 units in-transit (P39/P40 orders), we have approximately 151 units total, which covers over 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that the product (Tess Tee t-shirt) has low seasonal relevance in late November and the upcoming periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (34.4 * 5 = 172) and sigma_hat based on the same window to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the high-summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization: Average demand for P37-P41 is ~34 units/period, confirming a return to early-year baseline levels as t-shirt seasonality declines in November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved t-shirt, which has seen a significant seasonal decline from its summer peaks (~170 units) to late autumn lows. Since Period 34 (early October), demand has dropped through several plateaus, most recently stabilizing at an average of 34 units/period (P37-P41). The last four periods (P39-P42) show even lower demand averaging ~23.75 units (21, 15, 32, 27). Given this is early December, t-shirt demand is likely at its seasonal trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position (On-hand: 85, In-transit: 60) totals 145 units. With an estimated demand of ~25-30 units per period, this position covers approximately 5 periods of supply, which is appropriate for a (L+1=5) horizon. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current late autumn/early winter baseline (~26.6 units/period) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the moderate volatility seen during this taper.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Average demand for P39-P42 is ~23.8 units/period, representing the seasonal minimum for t-shirts in December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 (T-shirt) is in its annual seasonal trough (December). Demand has significantly declined from the summer peak (~164) and autumn transition (~75) to a winter baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 21.4 units/period, confirming the 'Winter demand trough' noted in carry-over insights. Total inventory position (On-hand: 109 + In-transit: 24 = 133) is very high relative to current demand. With a lead time of 4, 133 units cover over 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~21 units/period). This suggests the system is overstocked for the current period, and no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent winter regime (average ~21), which multiplied by (1+L) = 105, is already covered by the current physical inventory (109), ensuring the backend places a zero or minimal order and avoids further holding costs. L=4 remains consistent with historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-88.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt SKU (711053004) is in its annual winter trough. Historically, demand in Dec/Jan is the lowest point of the year (~15-30 units/period). Recent demand (P43-P44) has been very low at 12 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 100 units, with 21 more in-transit (ordered P42, expected P46). Given a 4-period lead time and demand averaging around 20-25 units, 100 on-hand units already cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand. Placing a new order now would only increase holding costs, which are $1.0/unit, equal to the profit margin. Therefore, the goal is to draw down existing inventory. I will set the mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this low-demand winter regime (~19.8 units/period before (1+L) multiplier), ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the lower requirement.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for the 'Tess Tee' has predictably reached its seasonal trough during the winter months. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 19.7 units per period, consistently significantly lower than the autumn average of ~40 and the summer peak of ~164. Currently, there are 80 units on-hand and 21 units in-transit (ordered in Period 42), totaling 101 units of pipeline inventory. Given that the promised lead time (L) remains 4, the target stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current consumption rate of ~20 units/period, 101 units provides approximately 5 periods of coverage. To avoid unnecessary holding costs for this seasonal item at its lowest relevance, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current winter demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at default (4). The backend logic will likely result in a zero or minimal order given the high current inventory relative to winter demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the end-of-year/winter trough for T-shirts. Demand has consistently remained low since mid-November, with the latest average (P43-P46) at 15 units/period. The holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($1.0) are equal (q=0.5), meaning the OR backend aims to stock exactly the mean demand over the lookahead horizon (L+1 periods). On-hand inventory is 85 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (15 units/period), making additional orders unnecessary. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current winter low, which informs the safety stock calculation effectively while letting the high on-hand inventory dissipate naturally.
