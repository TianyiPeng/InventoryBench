  "rationale": "The product is a 'Long T-shirt' (Jersey Basic), which is a wardrobe essential. The calendar date is mid-February (ending winter, moving toward spring in many markets). Historical demand shows a strong upward trend: 6 -> 13 -> 32 -> 49 -> 62. This suggests a seasonal 'spring build' or a product launch lifecycle where demand is scaling rapidly. Current demand is likely to be at least 60-80 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the growth trend, I will forecast an average demand of ~70 units over the next 5 weeks (350 units total). Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to place a substantial order to catch up to this growth and establish a safety buffer, especially as holding costs equal profit ($1.0), meaning over-stocking is just as costly as under-stocking. I will order 350 units to establish the pipeline.",

(e) To cover demand until the Period 1 order arrives (Period 5), and considering the lag for the order placed TODAY (which arrives Period 6), I need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 5-6 weeks of demand. With demand trending between 40-70 units, 6 weeks of coverage suggests a total pipeline of ~350-400 units. Since 350 units are already in transit and the stockout is immediate, I will place a moderate additional order to buffer against the rising trend and the long lead time.",

Period 12 demand (53) was lower but still above the Q1 average (~35-40). T-shirt demand typically holds or increases as we move into summer (May/June). Current on-hand inventory is 59 units, which is barely enough to cover potential demand for Period 13. However, an order of 350 units was placed in Period 12. Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods (validated in P5 and P6), this large order is expected to arrive in Period 16 (P12 + 4).

Total inventory needed for the L+1 window (Periods 13-17) using an estimated demand of 75 units/period (average of recent 'warm weather' spikes) is ~375 units. Total pipeline (59 on-hand + 350 in-transit) = 409 units. While 409 units covers the forecast (375), the delay in arrival until P16 means we risk a stockout in P14 and P15 if demand remains high. However, since the P12 order of 350 is already arriving soon and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), over-ordering creates a significant penalty. I will not place an additional order this period as the existing pipeline of 350 is substantial and the risk of holding costs on excessive inventory outweighs the marginal profit of covering a potential 2-period stockout before the big shipment arrives.",

Our current on-hand inventory is 20 units, while current 'In-transit' is 350 units (ordered in P12, expected to arrive in P16).

As we are now in late May (P15), we are entering peak summer season for t-shirts. The on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we are currently losing sales. A shipment of 350 units was placed in P12 and is expected to arrive in P16 (P12 + 4 periods lead time). My goal is to cover demand for the lead time plus one period (P15-P20). Given the summer seasonality, I forecast average demand at roughly 60 units/period (reflecting the late April surge and sustained interest). Required inventory for P15-P20 = 6 periods * 60 units = 360 units. Pipeline check: On-hand (0) + In-transit (350) = 350. There is a small deficit, but since the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as understocking.

Historical data and previous carry-over insights demonstrate a clear seasonal tapering. After a high-summer peak in June/July (averaging ~160 units), demand in August has dropped significantly (P26-P28 demand: 78, 79, 65), establishing a post-summer regime with a mean around 70-75 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, I have 454 units on-hand with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (total coverage needed for L+1 = 5 periods), and assuming the downward trend continues as the weather cools (typical for short-sleeve t-shirts in the fall), 454 units provides over 6 periods of coverage (454 / ~70 = 6.4 periods).

With the game ending in Period 47 (10 periods remaining) and expected demand tapering towards 35-40 units/period, the current supply of 302 units covers approximately 8 of the remaining 10 weeks.

In the last three periods (P36-P38), demand has been 35, 63, and 41, averaging 46.3 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 161 units. There are 100 units in-transit (ordered P35), which are expected to arrive in Period 39 (based on the confirmed 4-period lead time). This will bring total availability to approximately 261 units. Given the winter regime mean of ~45 units and the game ending in Period 47 (9 periods remaining), total expected demand is approximately 405 units (9 periods * 45 units). Current inventory plus in-transit covers 5.8 periods. To cover the remaining pipeline while minimizing holding costs for this low-profit ($1) and high-holding-cost ($1) SKU, I need to ensure sufficient stock for the lead time (4) plus one period. On-hand + In-transit (261) is enough to cover approx 5.8 periods of demand.
