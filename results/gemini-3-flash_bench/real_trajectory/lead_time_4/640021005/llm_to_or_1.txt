Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 640021005 (denim trousers). The history shows 5 samples: 6, 4, 20, 14, 18. The mean of these 5 samples is 12.4. There is a noticeable jump from the first two weeks (avg 5) to the last three weeks (avg 17.3). Given the product is 'Extra-high waist, ankle-length jeans' and it is mid-February, we are likely seeing the start of spring season demand. The promised lead time is 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the higher volume observed in the most recent samples (17.3 per week), which is more representative than the full history mean. For L and sigma_hat, I will use defaults as we have no arrivals yet to infer lead time deviations and volatility remains moderate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pair of high-waisted denim jeans from the 'Divided' collection. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were 6, 4, 20, 14, 18. Period 1 demand was 24, indicating a sustained higher demand regime compared to the very early Jan weeks. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (30 units) was placed in Period 1 and has a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). The 30 units in-transit match the Period 1 order. Demand is currently trending upwards (mean of last 3 samples: 14, 18, 24 = 18.67). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent trend and default for L and sigma_hat until more arrival data is available.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to zero starting inventory. Total in-transit is 62 units (30 from P1, 32 from P2). The promised lead time is 4. No units have arrived yet, which is expected as the earliest an order from P1 could arrive (if L=0) would have been P1, but based on L=4, we expect the P1 order in P5 and the P2 order in P6. Historical demand samples (last 5: 6, 4, 20, 14, 18) plus recent observed demand (24, 29) suggest an upward trend/higher mean than the initial samples. The average of all available samples (including observed demand) is (6+4+20+14+18+24+29)/7 = 16.4. The average of the most recent 3 is (18+24+29)/3 = 23.6. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default promised lead time L=4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', which experienced a significant demand spike in Period 3 (95 units, up from 24-29 in earlier periods). This spike aligns with typical spring fashion demand increases. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in Period 4, the first order (Period 1) is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (arrival resolution) and be visible in Period 6's conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 93 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). We are out of stock and losing sales on high demand. Given the abrupt jump in demand in Period 3, I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend while acknowledging the early baseline (6, 4, 20, 14, 18 from historical data plus the game periods). However, since P3 is so high (95), I'll use explicit to bridge the gap and ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover the current high-demand momentum during the 4-period lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waist denim trousers from the 'Divided' collection (likely youth-oriented fashion). Historically, demand was low (6-18) in January and early February but spiked significantly starting 2019-02-25 (Period 3: 95 units) and 2019-03-04 (Period 4: 174 units), suggesting a seasonal spring shift or trend popularity. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (30 units) are expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 start message. Thus, the current 'In-transit' of 208 units covers orders from P1-P4. Given the massive demand increase (+500% from early Feb levels), I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime (Periods 2, 3, and 4), while sticking to the promised lead time 'default' as we haven't reached the 4-period window to confirm actual arrival behavior yet.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 3 (2019-02-25): demand surged from avg ~15 units to 95-174 units, likely due to spring seasonality for denim.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a seasonal denim item. Evidence from Period 3 (2019-02-25) onwards confirms a significant regime shift in demand: Period 1-2 averaged ~27 units, while Periods 3-5 averaged ~174 units (95, 174, 254), clearly indicating early spring seasonality. The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 (ordered Period 1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand spike exceeding arrivals, and there are 397 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). To address the new demand level, I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (the new regime) which averages ~174 units per period. Since L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods (L+1) of this higher demand level. I will set L to 4 using the 'default' method as it aligns with observations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting 2019-02-25 (Period 3): Mean demand increased from ~27 to ~174 (+540%). Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 640021005 (Denim Trousers) is experiencing a high-demand regime triggered by spring seasonality, starting Period 3. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) is approximately 174 units, compared to ~26 in the first two periods. We have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a massive pipeline of 671 units. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The system is currently severely stock-out prone because the initial orders (P1-P3) were sized for a low-demand regime. However, large orders from P4 (115), P5 (219), and P6 (306) are in transit and will begin arriving in P8, P9, and P10 respectively. For Period 7, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (P3-P6: 95, 174, 254, 173). L is set to calculate as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Denim TRS) has experienced a massive shift in demand starting in Period 3 (2019-02-25), likely due to spring seasonality. Current demand levels (P3-P7) are averaging approximately 188 units per week (95, 174, 254, 173, 243). My current on-hand inventory is 0, and I have 921 units in-transit. Arrivals have consistently followed the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7). Following this pattern, I expect the P4 order (115 units) to arrive in Period 8, and the P5 order (219 units) in Period 9. The total pipeline covers the next few weeks, but the base stock needs to reflect the high-demand regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand average since the regime shift (~188 units * 5 periods = 940). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Avg demand for last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 187.8 units, compared to ~26 units in P1-P2. Seasonal peak for denim trousers remains active.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' (Denim Trousers) has entered a high-demand regime since late February, with demand peaking significantly in Period 8 (578 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been consistently selling out due to small historical orders arriving. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is 252.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the initial weeks. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 312 units. Period 8's demand of 578 units may be a spike (possibly a pre-Easter surge or specific fashion trend reaching peak), but it necessitates a higher mu_hat to ensure we don't under-order during the capped policy calculation. Using recent_N (N=6) to capture the high-regime mean (~253) while acknowledging the extreme volatility (sigma_hat) using recent data. Setting L to default (4 periods) as observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased sharply in Period 8 (demand: 578), roughly 2.3x the average of the high-regime (P3-P7). Monitoring if this 500+ level is sustained or a one-time spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a high-waisted denim jean, which is currently in its peak spring season. Historical demand shows a massive shift from Period 3 onwards. While Period 8 saw a massive spike (578), Period 9 returned to a more manageable level (216), suggesting Period 8 was an outlier or a temporary surge rather than a new permanent mean. Averaging demand from Period 3 (when the high regime started) to Period 9 gives a mean of approximately 247 units. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (3 units), but the in-transit pipeline is very large (1258 units), primarily due to large orders placed in Periods 6-9. To prevent over-ordering as the season progresses, I will use a recent N=7 (Periods 3-9) to capture the high-demand regime while smoothing the volatility of the Period 8 spike. This will set mu_hat based on the current season's mean (~247 units * (1+4) = 1235) and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility experienced during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for high-regime (P3-P9) is approximately 250 units/period, despite the P8 spike of 578. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

The current date is April 22, 2019. The product 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is in its peak spring season. Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift starting Period 3 (Late Feb), with demand increasing from ~27 to a mean of approximately 250 units (P3-P10, excluding the P8 spike of 578). Recent demand has stabilized: P9 was 216 and P10 was 183. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 126 units on-hand and 1221 in-transit (P7-P10 orders totaling 281+139+532+269 = 1221), we are well-covered for the coming weeks. For OR parameters, I will use L=4 (promised and verified). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of recent regime (P3-P10). Since P8 was an extreme outlier, I will use a period-weighted average (N=8) to capture the high-regime mean (~240) without over-reacting to the single 578 spike or the recent lower 183 dip, ensuring enough safety stock to cover demand volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime mean for high-season (P3-P10) confirmed at approximately 240 units/period. Period 8 (578 units) remains an outlier compared to the surrounding weeks (avg ~200).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Demand for the last three periods has been 216, 183, and 138, suggesting a cooling down from the mid-April peak and the Period 8 outlier (578). The average demand since the regime shift (P3-P11) is approximately 230, but the last three periods average 179. Promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met. With 269 on-hand and 1065 in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), our pipeline is significant. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P3-P11) to capture the high-season average while allowing the OR engine to account for the actual 4-period lead time (L+1=5 periods of coverage). This balances the risk of the recent downward trend with the overall seasonal strength.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially softening: after the high-regime peak, the last 3 periods (P9-P11) average 179 units, compared to the P3-P11 average of 230.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. We are tracking 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a seasonal fashion item. Historical data showed a demand surge in early spring (P3-P8), followed by a softening trend. Specifically, demand in the last 4 periods (P9-P12) has averaged 174.75 units (216, 183, 138, 162), which is significantly lower than the P3-P8 average of ~253 units. The extreme spike of 578 in P8 is clearly an outlier. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (L=4). With on-hand inventory at 246 and in-transit at 997, we are well-stocked for the current demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current post-peak demand level (~175 units/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility following the P8 spike. The L parameter remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: avg demand for last 4 periods (P9-P12) is ~175 units, a 30% decrease from the high-regime (P3-P8) average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product (Perrie Trash HW Denim) experienced a high demand regime from late February through April (Periods 3-8), peaking at 578 units in Period 8. Carry-over insights and historical data for the last 5 periods (P9-P13: 216, 183, 138, 162, 127) show a clear cooling trend as spring transitions to summer. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 165.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (L=4). With on-hand inventory at 651 and in-transit at 465 (total pipeline = 1116), we are well-stocked for approximately 6.7 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I am selecting recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand behavior, while keeping L at default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand cooling transition: Demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 165 units, down from the P3-P8 average of ~250 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear peak in March/April (the denim high-season) followed by a sustained cooling trend. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has dropped to approximately 157 units, with the most recent two periods (P13 and P14) dropping further to 127 and 117 units respectively. This suggests the peak season is over and the product is entering a lower-demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 803 units, which covers more than 5 periods of recent average demand (157 * 5 = 785). With 196 units also in-transit, the pipeline is more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-peak mean (157 * 5 = 785) while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering due to high stock levels, minimizing holding costs as demand softens.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime cooling confirmed (P9-P14): mean demand decreased to ~157 units, with the last two periods (P13-P14) showing a further decline to ~122 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019-05-27), the product (denim trousers) is continuing its post-peak cooling phase. Previous Carry-over insights identified a high-regime (P3-P8) average of ~250 units, followed by a transition (P9-P12) to ~175 units, and most recently (P13-P15) an average of ~175 units despite a one-off spike of 281 in Period 15. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 185 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 647 units, with 71 units arriving soon from the P12 order. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With a target mean of ~180 units/period, the total required inventory is roughly 900 units. Current total inventory (647 on-hand + 71 in-transit = 718) indicates we are slightly under-stocked for the current 180-unit regime if we want to guard against volatility, however, the OR backend's capping mechanism and high on-hand suggests we should calibrate the parameters to the most recent behavior. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the post-peak cooling while acknowledging the recent spike, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P15) mean confirmed at approximately 185 units/period, showing significant softening from the P3-P8 peak (~250 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', which experienced a significant spring/early summer season peaking in April (Period 8: 578 units). Current historical demand from Period 9 to Period 16 shows a clear softening/post-peak stabilization, averaging approximately 163 units per period (1307 total over 8 weeks). Specifically, the last four periods (P13-P16) show a lower average of ~164 units despite one spike in P15. Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 587 units (representing about 3.5 weeks of cover at the current average) and 266 units arriving in P20, the goal is to maintain a buffer that reflects the current downward/stable volume rather than the previous peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current post-peak regime average (approx 163 * (4+1) = 815) and using recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the persisting volatility (P15 spike) while avoiding the massive outlier of P8.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P16) average remains stable at approximately 163 units/period, down ~35% from the high-regime (P3-P8) average.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a seasonal denim item. History shows three distinct demand regimes: (1) Pre-season (P1-P2, avg ~26), (2) Peak-season (P3-P8, avg ~250), and (3) Post-peak stabilization (P9-P17). Over the last 9 periods (P9-P17), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 159 units with lower volatility compared to the peak. Period 17 show a demand of 125, continuing this trend. Regarding logistics, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated in P5-P16 concludes). However, Period 17 conclude shows 0 arrivals, which is expected since no orders were placed in Period 13. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using N=9 for mu_hat captures the post-peak regime (P9-P17) to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for the stabilize demand. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 366 (P16 order: 266, P17 order: 100), plus inventory on-hand of 462, totaling 828 units. L=4 remains the most reliable lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P17) mean stabilized at ~159 units/period, roughly 35-40% below spring peak levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Period 19). The SKU is a pair of high-waist denim jeans which saw a significant spring peak (P3-P8) and has since transitioned into a stable post-peak cooling regime. In the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has been 131, 125, and 96, averaging ~117. This confirms the multi-period downward trend noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P13-P16 arrivals confirm this). There have been no arrivals in P17 and P18 because orders were 0 in P13-P15. Arrivals will resume in P20 (from the P16 order of 266). On-hand is 366 and In-transit is 463. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are $1/unit, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (P13-P18) to capture the current lower demand level (~130 units/period) while ignoring the earlier high-regime volatility. This keeps the base stock aligned with the cooling seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime further softened: avg demand for last 3 periods (P16-P18) decreased to 117 units, down from the P9-P15 average of ~185 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal peak for these denim trousers in late Spring (P3-P8), followed by a cooling phase (P9-P15), and a more recent softening in late June. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has recorded 125, 96, and 142 units, respectively, averaging approximately 121 units/period. This is a significant decrease from the P9-P16 average of ~163 units. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower late-June/early-July demand level, as seasonality for denim typically dips in mid-summer. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical conclusions. On-hand (224) plus in-transit (492) totals 716 units, which is approximately 5.9 periods of coverage at the current demand rate, suggesting a healthy stock position for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Mid-summer demand softening confirmed; average demand for P17-P19 is 121 units, down 25% from the P9-P16 post-peak average (~163).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical data for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' shows a significant seasonal peak in early spring (P3-P8), followed by a sustained softening in demand throughout late spring and early summer. The average demand for the most recent 10-period 'post-peak' regime (P11-P20) is approximately 139 units/period. The most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) show even lower stability around 116 units/period, confirming the summer slowdown. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 388, and in-transit is 226 (orders from P17, P18, P19). Current total exposure (on-hand + in-transit = 614 units) covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (116-139 units/period). Given the declining trend, I will use a recent 5-period window (P16-P20) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which reflects the current summer regime (~119 units/period) while ignoring the earlier spring spikes. This prevents over-ordering as we move through the slower summer months.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P20) stabilized at ~119 units/period, a significant reduction from the P11-P15 average of ~158 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status for SKU 640021005 is healthy with 343 units on hand and 145 units in-transit. Demand analysis shows a clear transition from the spring peak (P3-P8 avg ~250) to a lower summer regime. For the last six periods (P16-P21), demand has stabilized at an average of ~123 units per period (131, 125, 96, 142, 102, 145). The carry-over insights confirm this softening, noting a shift to approximately ~119 units/period recently. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the system must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the recent stabilization, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current summer demand regime (approx. 123 * 5 = 615 units total required between on-hand and pipeline). Setting L to default (4) as the lead time is stable.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical data confirms a stable summer demand regime for these denim trousers. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 141.8 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) average 127.4 units. The 'summer softening' identified in previous carry-over insights seems to have stabilized between 110-150 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as seen in the arrivals for P21 and P22. We are currently holding 288 units on-hand with 206 in-transit (Total pipeline: 494). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At an average of ~130 units, this requires ~650 units of coverage. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend targets a high service level (80%). I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current stable summer profile and use the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilized in Period 22: avg demand (P18-P22) is 127.4 units/period, showing recovery from the mid-summer low observed in P17-P19 (~121 units).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' is a denim trouser, showing a clear seasonal peak in spring (Periods 3-8) followed by a cooling period, and now stabilizing in a mid-summer demand regime. For Period 24 (July 22), the demand has trended upward slightly over the last four periods (P20: 102, P21: 145, P22: 152, P23: 177), with a recent 4-period average (P20-P23) of approximately 144 units. This is up from the mid-summer low of ~120 units but still well below the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P20, P21, P22, and P23). I am choosing recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend in the summer demand window (P19-P23 average is 143.6 units). This ensures the base stock reflects the current moderate-demand regime while the OR backend manages the tradeoff between the $4 profit and $1 holding cost per unit.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery: Avg demand for last 4 periods (P20-P23) increased to 144 units, up ~20% from the previous summer low (~120 units in P17-P19). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (2019/7/29), we observe demand of 104 in Period 24. The summer demand recovery noted in 'Carry-over Insights' continues, with recent demand showing a subtle upward trend from the mid-summer lows (P21: 145, P22: 152, P23: 177, P24: 104). The average of the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 136 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P23, ordered P19 arrived P23). Although 'In-transit' shows 537 units, most of this relates to recent large orders from periods 22, 23, and 24, which are expected in periods 26, 27, and 28 respectively. Inventory on-hand is low (36 units). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-to-recovering summer demand regime (avg ~136), while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Denim Trousers) is entering August. Historical demand has transitioned from a spring peak (P3-P8 avg ~250) to a volatile summer regime. Most recently (P20-P25), the demand average is approximately 140 units, but with significant fluctuation (ranging from 102 to 177). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 25, while 686 units are in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have a stockout and the pipeline includes orders from P22, P23, and P24 that haven't arrived yet (expected in P26, P27, P28), I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (P20-P25) to capture the current summer demand level (~140/period). I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P20-P25) mean established at ~140 units/period with continued high volatility (StdDev approx 30). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (denim trousers) is currently in a summer demand regime. Demand for the last 7 periods (P20-P26) has averaged 148 units/period, with the most recent sample at 195 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods) due to a lead-time structural gap (P20 skip) followed by high demand. On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 601 units (from orders P23-P26). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P22 order in P26. We will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current mean of ~148, resulting in a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the moderate volatility (StdDev ~33).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P20-P26) mean established at ~148 units/period, showing significant recovery from mid-summer lows (~120). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a late summer/early autumn transition for denim (a core product). Recent demand (P23-P27) shows a significant upward trend compared to mid-summer, with demand readings of 177, 104, 161, 195, and 190. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 165 units, up from the ~140 average observed earlier in the summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced stockouts (lost sales) in the last three periods (P25-P27), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture this new demand level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand surge and volatility, and default for L as there is no evidence of lead time deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 23: Late summer/Pre-autumn recovery established with avg demand increasing to ~165 units/period (P23-P27) from previous summer mean of ~140. Consistent stockouts in P25-P27 indicate the need for higher base stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-26. We are observing a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery in demand for denim trousers. Demand from Period 23 to 28 has averaged 163.7 units, a significant increase from the previous mid-summer low (P17-P22 average of ~127). The most recent demand (P28) was 155. Stockouts occurred in Periods 25, 26, and 27, resulting in an ending inventory of 34 units for Period 28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrival (P24 order arriving in P28). To capture this sustained recovery and prevent further stockouts as we enter the autumn season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P23-P28) to reflect the new regime. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand observed since mid-July.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand is in a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery phase. The recent 5 periods (P25-P29) show a mean demand of 147.4 units/period, but this includes a period of stockouts (P25-P27) that likely masked true demand. The last three periods (P27-P29) averaged 157 units. I will use recent_N=5 (P25-P29) to calculate the mean to capture this upward shift compared to the mid-summer lows. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P25-P29). Pipeline inventory (679) plus current on-hand (76) equals 755 units, which covers approximately 4.8 periods of recent demand (755/157 \u2248 4.8). Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are in a replenishment cycle. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to maintain the higher base stock necessary to prevent the stockouts seen in August.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Pre-autumn recovery confirmed (P25-P29): demand mean stabilized at ~155 units/period, following mid-summer lows (~120). Consistent arrivals confirm lead time remains 4 periods.

Demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) specifically averaged 165 units. Although Period 30 ended with a small stockout due to a lower-than-expected arrival (73 units from P26), the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the product is denim trousers, demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase moving into the autumn season. I will use recent_N with N=8 (P23-P30) to capture this recovered regime for the demand mean, and default settings for lead time and sigma to provide a robust buffer against recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data indicates a demand regime change starting around Period 23 (mid-August), transitioning from summer lows (~120 units) to a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery. Over the last 9 periods (P23-P31), the average demand is 155.4 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) show a slightly lower average of 152.2 units, but with consistent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P27 order in P31. The inventory position shows 74 units on hand and 783 units in transit. To maintain a sufficient service level for this recovering demand regime while accounting for recent stockouts in P25-P27 and P30, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current stable recovery phase and use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed since the end of July.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Pre-autumn demand regime (P23-P31) confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~155 units/period, showing a steady recovery from summer lows (~120). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Denim Trousers) is currently in a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery phase. Looking at the demand history since the detected recovery in Period 23, the mean demand has stabilized around 155-160 units (P23-P32 average is ~157). Although there was a slight dip in the last two periods (131 and 137), this remains consistent with the established regime. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods, with every order since Period 16 (except the gap in P20) arriving exactly at L=4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 163 and in-transit is 557 (comprised of orders from P29, P30, and P31). To maintain the desired cycle service level (approx 80% based on profit/holding cost) given the 4-period lead time plus the 1-period review cycle, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable recovery regime while smoothing out minor weekly fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Denim Trousers) is in a late-summer/early-autumn recovery phase. Looking at the last 10 periods (P24-P33), demand has stabilized around a mean of 154 units per period (sum=1540), recovering from mid-summer lows of ~120 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33 conclude. Although on-hand inventory is 161 and in-transit is 485 (total pipeline 646), the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. At a mean of ~155, 5 periods equals 775 units. Recent volatility (standard deviation of ~25-30) suggests we need to maintain a robust buffer to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 25-27 and 30. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stabilized recovery regime for both mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Pre-autumn demand regime (P24-P33) stabilized at a mean of ~154 units/period with moderate volatility (StdDev ~25), requiring higher base stock levels than mid-summer.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU is denim trousers, which experienced a spring peak and a mid-summer slump. We are currently in a late-summer/autumn recovery phase. Looking at the last 10 periods (P25-P34), demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 147 units per period (161, 195, 190, 155, 126, 159, 131, 137, 177, 97). However, the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a slightly lower mean of 140 units. The 'Period 34 conclude' message confirms that the P30 order arrived exactly 4 periods later, maintaining a stable lead time of 4. With 189 units on hand and 537 in transit (covering orders from periods 31, 33, and 34), we are well-positioned. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the overall autumn recovery level (~147/period) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (StdDev ~30). This balances the need to stay stocked for the recovery while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand softens further into late October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical data (P31-P35) indicates a significant cooling in demand, with values dropping from the mid-150s to 131, 137, 177, 97, and 72. The last two periods average roughly 85 units, and the last 5 average 111 units. This aligns with a typical mid-autumn slowdown for 'hard-worn' denim trousers before any potential winter holiday spikes. On-hand inventory is healthy at 374, and in-transit is 376 (orders from P33-P35: 103, 177, 96). Total pipeline is 750 units. Given the recent softening, I am reducing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the last 5 periods (N=5) and using the recent volatility (N=5) for sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 34: Autumn demand cooling confirmed; mean demand for P31-P35 dropped to ~111 units/period, down from the P24-P33 mean of ~154 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data confirms a significant cooling trend in the 'Autumn' period. Mean demand for the last five periods (P32-P36) is approximately 87 units, a sharp drop from the late-summer recovery average of ~154 units. Specifically, demand in the last three periods has been 97, 72, and 53, indicating a continued downward trajectory. With on-hand inventory at 321 and in-transit units at 376 (Total 697), the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the cooling demand for the next lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will set mu_hat to reflect this lower regime using the last 5 periods (N=5) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal decline. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (Autumn) confirmed (P32-P36): mean demand dropped to ~87 units/period from the previous P24-P33 mean of ~154 units/period (-43%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 640021005 (denim trousers) has entered a clear autumn cooling phase. Since Period 34 (late September), the mean demand has dropped significantly from ~154 units to ~87 units (P32-P36) and most recently to ~75 units (P34-P37), a decline of roughly 50%. On-hand inventory is healthy at 345 units with 273 units in transit (including an expected arrival of 177 units from P34). Given the current holding cost ($1.0) and profit margin ($4.0), and the clear downward trend in autumn demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling regime (P34-P37 mean demand is 75.25). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P33 order arrived in P37). High on-hand levels and declining demand warrant lean ordering to avoid excessive holding costs in the off-peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn-Winter demand cooling confirmed: mean demand for P34-P37 has stabilized at ~75 units/period, down from the late-summer recovery mean of ~154 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' has significantly cooled as we enter the late autumn/winter season (starting around Period 34). Recent demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) is 97, 72, 53, 79, and 56, averaging ~71 units per period. This is a sharp decline from the late-summer recovery mean of ~154 units. With 466 units on hand and 96 units in-transit (reaching a total of 562), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current demand regime. The target base stock for a lead time of 4 periods (+1 for the review period) at ~71 units/period would be around 355-400 units. Since current starting inventory (466) already exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I am setting L to 4 (stable), mu_hat to reflect the recent N=5 average (~355 units total for L+1), and sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn-Winter demand regime for denim trousers confirmed at Period 39: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has stabilized at ~71 units/period, down over 50% from the late-summer recovery peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 640021005 (denim trousers) has entered a clear autumn/winter cooling phase consistent with seasonal patterns. Following the late-summer recovery peak (approx 155 units/period), demand has dropped significantly over the last six periods. The mean demand for P34-P39 is 67.3 units (97, 72, 53, 79, 56, 47), which is a roughly 56% decline from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 515 units with 0 in-transit. Given the cooling demand and a lead time of 4 periods, total exposure (L+1 = 5 periods) at current demand levels requires approximately 335-350 units. With 515 units on-hand, we are significantly overstocked for the current regime. I will use the recent 6 periods (P34-P39) to define the new demand mean and volatility to prevent further unnecessary orders and minimize holding costs while the backend naturally depletes the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn-Winter demand regime for denim trousers (P34-P39) mean settled at ~67 units/period, down ~56% from late-summer peak. Significant overstock exists (515 units) relative to current demand levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' has continued to decline as we enter the late autumn/winter season. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 51.8 units, which is a significant drop from the autumn mean (~71 units) and much lower than the summer peak (~150 units). On-hand inventory is currently at 491 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current average demand, 491 units represents nearly 10 periods of supply, which is significantly more than the required base stock for a 4-period lead time plus 1-period review cycle (L+1 = 5). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this current low-demand regime. This will result in a base stock much lower than the current inventory, preventing any new orders and allowing the existing overstock to be drawn down, thereby minimizing future holding costs while the product is in its low-season period.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Late Autumn/Winter demand regime (P36-P40) mean confirmed at ~52 units/period, a ~27% decrease from the early autumn mean (P34-P38). Significant overstock (491 units) remains.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is in a significant seasonal cooling phase as of late November (Period 41). Demand has stabilized at a much lower level (mean of ~46 units/period over P37-P41) compared to its late-summer peak (~155 units). There is a substantial overstock situation with 460 units on-hand, which covers nearly 10 periods of current demand, while the review+lead time horizon is only 5 periods (L=4). No further orders are needed to meet the predicted demand through the end of the simulation. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime: L remains at the stable 4 periods, mu_hat uses the recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while avoiding earlier high-season noise, and sigma_hat uses the same N=5 to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter demand regime (P37-P41) mean stabilized at ~46 units/period, roughly 70% below the late-summer recovery peak (~155 units). Overstock of 460 units is sufficient for remaining periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) with 5 periods remaining in the simulation. The current SKU (denim trousers) is in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged ~47 units (56, 47, 24, 31, 78). The surge in Period 42 (78 units) might be related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the date (Nov 25), but even with this spike, the mean remains significantly lower than the summer peak. We currently have 382 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. With total expected remaining demand over the next 5 periods estimated at approximately 250-300 units (based on current mean + buffer), our current on-hand inventory (382) is more than sufficient to cover the rest of the game WITHOUT additional ordering. Any further orders would likely result in unnecessary holding costs at the end of the simulation. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend's base stock stays below our current inventory level to prevent redundant orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand remains in low-season regime (P38-P42 avg ~47). Periodic spikes (e.g., P42 demand 78) are likely calendar-driven (Black Friday) but do not represent a sustained regime shift for this SKU. On-hand inventory is sufficient for the remaining periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 44 out of 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would only arrive during Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering more stock is unnecessary. Current on-hand inventory is 357 units, while the recent low-season demand (P38-P43) has averaged approximately 47 units per period. With only 4 periods remaining (P44-P47), total expected demand is less than 200 units, making the existing stock more than sufficient. The objective now shifts to minimizing holding costs by ensuring no further orders are placed. Setting mu_hat to a minimal value via recent_N (N=1) and sigma_hat to default will effectively stop the OR backend from placing new orders while we draw down the existing overstock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47. Based on the 2019 calendar, we are in the late-season/holiday period. The SKU 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is currently in a sustained low-demand regime (Autumn-Winter). Recent demand samples (P40: 24, P41: 31, P42: 78, P43: 25, P44: 17) average approx 35 units/period. On-hand inventory is 340 units with 0 in-transit. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's end. Furthermore, current on-hand inventory (340) is nearly 10x the recent average weekly demand, providing more than enough cover for the remaining periods. I will set parameters to stop further ordering while maintaining a realistic statistical profile for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Current on-hand inventory (340 units) is sufficient to cover remaining 3 periods of the game given the low-season demand regime (~35 units/period). Zero further orders required.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of a 47-period game. The product (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is in a low-demand winter regime, with recent demand averaging approximately 30-40 units per period (P43-P45: 25, 17, 28). Current on-hand inventory is 312 units. Since the game ends after Period 47, there are only 2 periods of demand remaining (Period 46 and Period 47 resolution). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would not arrive until Period 50, which is well past the end of the simulation. With more than 10x the current average demand already on hand, and no more time for new orders to arrive and be sold, the objective is to minimize holding costs while ensuring no lost sales. Parameters are set to ensure no new orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, the final decision period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 304 units. Given that the demand in the most recent periods (P43-P46) has been very low (ranging from 8 to 28 units), the existing stock is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand. Since the game ends after this period's resolution, ordering any more units would only incur unnecessary holding costs without the possibility of generating further profit or even arriving before the game concludes. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no new order is placed.
