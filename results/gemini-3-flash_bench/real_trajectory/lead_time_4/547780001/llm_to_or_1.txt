Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Basic sweatpants', a staple item. Initial demand history (prior 5 weeks) shows samples: 121, 57, 75, 63, 57. The mean of these 5 samples is 74.6, but the first sample (121) likely includes a post-holiday or initial stocking spike, whereas the last four are more stable around 63. Promised lead time is 4. Since we have no observation history of arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=4) to focus on the stabilized demand level (~63 units/period) rather than the older outlier, helping to prevent overstocking of this low-margin ($1 profit), high-holding-cost ($1) item. The OR backend will compute mu_hat as (1+4)*63 = 315. Sigma_hat will be calculated based on the recent 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Basic sweatpants'. In Period 1, we ordered 77 units based on initial demand samples, but we started with 0 on-hand, leading to 69 lost sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order from Period 1 is in-transit and won't arrive until Period 5 (following the 4-period lead time rule), we need to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus current period demand (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 121, 57, 75, 63, 57. The average is approximately 74.6 units per week. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet in these early February dates, so I will use a recent_N approach for demand to keep the forecast grounded in the available data. For sigma, I'll use the default calculation across the samples to account for the volatility seen (high of 121, low of 57).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is 'Basic sweatpants', a staple item. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 have not occurred yet (promised lead time is 4). Total in-transit is 182 units (77 from P1 + 105 from P2). Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 18 shows: 121, 57, 75, 63, 57, 69, 52. The mean demand is approximately 70.5 units per period. There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead time deviation yet, as no orders have reached their expected arrival date (P1 order is expected in P5). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the full recent history (including the high outlier on Jan 7) to ensure adequate safety stock while waiting for initial arrivals. This setting balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (50% service level target).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Basic sweatpants' has a promised lead time of 4. Orders placed in P1 (Period 1 conclude shows ordered=77) are expected to arrive in P1 + 4 = Period 5. Consequently, we see 'arrived=0' in all conclude messages thus far (P1, P2, P3), which is expected for lead time L=4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 292 units in transit (77 from P1 + 105 from P2 + 110 from P3). Demand has been relatively stable across the last 5 samples (P1-P3 history plus seed data): 57, 52, 51. The historical mean of all available samples (121, 57, 75, 63, 57, 69, 52, 51) is approximately 68. With L=4, the backend needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the stabilization around ~55-60 units after the initial 121 peak, and keep L at 'default' since no evidence yet suggests the lead time differs from the promise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU 547780001 (Basic sweatpants) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 totaling 292 units are in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=4), the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during P5's arrival phase. We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'P5 conclude' message at the start of P6. Thus, zero arrivals so far is expected and does not yet indicate a delay. Demand has been relatively stable but slightly declining (69, 52, 51, 43). Including the provided samples (121, 57, 75, 63, 57), the mean demand is around 65. With Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting a target service level where on-hand inventory should roughly match the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available samples including the provided history) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to 'default' (4) as no evidence of lead time deviation exists yet.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is basic sweatpants, a staple item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the actual lead time L=4 (Period 5 conclude - Period 1 order). Demand over the last 5 weeks has been [69, 52, 51, 43, 48], showing a slight downward trend but generally averaging around 53 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 29, with 250 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P5). Total pipeline inventory is 279, which covers roughly 5 weeks of demand. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stabilization after the first week's spike, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the lead time is matching the promise and volatility is stable.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25 (Period 7). The SKU is 'Basic sweatpants'. Demand has trended downwards from an initial mean of ~75 (pre-game) to an average of ~50 over the last 6 periods (69, 52, 51, 43, 48, 37). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). I currently have 97 units on-hand and 145 in-transit (orders from P3, P5). Given the downward trend and the fact that 145 units are arriving soon for a product with a recent mean demand of 45-50, I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking while demand softens. The backend will use these to determine if an order is needed on top of the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower mean (avg ~50) compared to pre-game data (avg ~75).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-127.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is basic sweatpants. Observed demand in the last three periods (P5-P7) has been 48, 37, and 40 units (average ~41.6), which is significantly lower than the pre-game average of ~75. Including P4 (43), the recent mean is ~42. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of P1, P2, and P3 orders. We currently have high on-hand inventory (167) plus in-transit stock (43), totaling 210 units. This is roughly 5 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), minimizing excess stock is critical. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect the stable lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~42) while excluding the early high-demand noise. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at a lower mean (~42 units/period) during P4-P7, notably lower than the pre-game Jan samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the demand history from Period 1 to 8: 69, 52, 51, 43, 48, 37, 40, 49. The mean demand across these 8 periods is ~48.6 units/week, which is lower than the pre-game January average of ~75. Recent demand (P4-P8) is even lower at ~43.4. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (118) + in-transit (43) = 161 units. Using a mean of 45, 5 periods of demand is ~225. However, the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), which implies a target service level of 50% (z=0) via the critical ratio q = P/(P+H). In such a balanced scenario, the OR engine aims to keep stock near the expected mean demand. Since current inventory (161) is relatively high compared to recent demand, and there's no immediate seasonal spike expected for 'Basic sweatpants' in early April, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed 4-period offset.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees stable or slightly declining demand as spring progresses. Historical demand from P4 to P9 has been consistently lower than the January pre-game samples, averaging approximately 44 units per period (43, 48, 37, 40, 49, 46). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed consistently (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P5->P9 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 107, with 60 units in-transit (P7's order of 8 units due P11, and P9's order of 52 units due P13). Total pipeline inventory is 167 units. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 44 = 220 units. With 167 units in position, the OR engine will likely trigger a replenishment order. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable, lower demand regime to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs, which are equal to profit margins ($1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is basic sweatpants, categorized as 'Divided Basics'. Current demand across the last 6 periods (P5-P10) has averaged 40.6 units, showing a sustained decrease compared to the pre-game January average of ~75 and the February average of ~57. Period 10 showed a significant drop to 24 units, which may be a temporary fluctuation or a shift as spring weather arrives, reducing demand for 'brushed inside' jersey basics. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in periods 5, 6, 7, and 9. We currently have 83 units on hand and 112 in transit (8 from P7, 52 from P9, and 52 from P10). Since 112 units in the pipeline plus 83 on hand (total 195) likely covers the next 5 periods of demand (approx 200 units at the current mean), I will keep parameters stable using recent history to reflect the current lower demand regime (N=6 for mu_hat to capture the post-February shift, excluding the high-variance start).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th. The product is 'Basic sweatpants'. Demand has stayed consistently lower than the pre-game January/February levels. For the last 7 periods (P5-P11), demand has averaged 38.4 units, with the most recent two weeks being particularly low (24 and 25 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. We are currently well-stocked with 66 on-hand units and 113 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and P11). Given the current demand trend (averaging ~38 units recently) and the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which is approximately 190 units. Total inventory (on-hand 66 + pipeline 113) is 179 units. This is slightly below the target, so a small order is likely needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained lower demand regime while filtering out the higher early-season demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower (avg ~38 units) over the last 7 periods (P5-P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are in a spring demand regime. The demand over the last 8 periods (P5-P12) has averaged ~39 units, significantly lower than the pre-game January average (~75 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple successful arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7). On-hand inventory is currently low (22 units), but there are 127 units in-transit: 52 ordered in P9 (expected arrival P13), 52 from P10 (expected P14), 9 from P11 (expected P15), and 14 from P12 (expected P16). Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q = P/(P+H)) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over (L+1) periods. Using a recent demand window (N=8) captures the current stabilized spring regime while excluding the irrelevant high Jan/Feb data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This SKU (Basic Sweatpants) is a staple item, but demand has consistently underperformed compared to the initial January historical data (avg ~75). Over the last 9 periods (P5-P13), demand has averaged 39.0 units (48, 37, 40, 49, 46, 24, 25, 44, 38). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P9, P11, and P13. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 36 units and a significant in-transit pipeline of 122 units (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). At a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent average of ~39 units, total coverage needed is ~195 units. We have 158 units (36 + 122), suggesting a slight under-stock relative to the target if we simply maintained a 1:1 service level. However, given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we want to target the median demand. I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (N=9) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime more accurately than the full sample mean or the pre-game data. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically see peak demand in winter/early spring and lower demand as temperatures rise in late spring/summer. The historical demand data supports this: Period 1-5 (Feb-Mar) averaged ~57 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) have averaged ~36.8 units, confirming a downward seasonal shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P9, and P10 orders all arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is 107 (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14), with the P11 order (9 units) expected to arrive this period. I will use recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current lower demand level (~37 units), and recent_N=7 for \u03c3\u0302 to account for recent variability while maintaining a buffer. The backend OR logic will calculate base stock using these parameters to maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (targeting a 50% service level offset by the OR's safety factor).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed for May: avg demand dropped to ~37 units (P10-P14) versus ~42 units (P4-P7).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees steady or slightly decreasing demand as warmer weather approaches. Observed demand has stabilized significantly lower than the initial January samples. Over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand averaged 34 units (24, 25, 44, 38, 33, 40). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4), meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an on-hand inventory of 24 and in-transit of 100 (from P12, P13, P14, P15), the pipeline is healthy (124 units total). Based on an average demand of 34, the expected coverage needed is ~170 units. The current pipeline of 124 units suggests a need for a small order to bridge the gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (avg ~34), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at a lower mean of ~34 units (P10-P15) as of late May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees lower demand moving into the summer months. Demand over the last 7 periods (P10-P16) has averaged 33.3 units, confirming a sustained lower regime compared to early spring. The confirmed lead time is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (9 units). In-transit inventory stands at 132 units, comprising orders from Period 13 (47), 14 (37), 15 (2), and 16 (46). The order from Period 13 is expected to arrive this period (P17). To maintain service levels given the low on-hand stock and the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the recent summer stabilization and use the standard 4-period lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Summer mean (~33 units) as of June (P10-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019 (Period 18). The product is basic sweatpants, which typically see lower demand during summer months. Demand in the most recent periods (P10-P17) has averaged approximately 31.25 units, significantly lower than earlier in the year. The last demand point (Period 17) was particularly low at 17 units, suggesting a potential seasonal trough. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P9, P11, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17). Inventory levels are currently comfortable with 39 units on-hand and 111 in-transit, totaling 150 units of pipeline inventory, which covers roughly 4.8 periods of current average demand. To reflect the lower summer demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand behavior since mid-April. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility profile (range 17 to 44). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed for June: avg demand further dropped to ~31 units (P10-P17) from the May average of ~37 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees lower demand in the summer. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward shift: Jan pre-game avg was ~75, March/April avg was ~40, and the most recent 9 periods (P10-P18) have averaged 31.1 units. The last four periods (P15-P18) show a very stable mean around 29 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (observed in historical 'conclude' messages for orders from P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, and P14). I will set L to 'default' (4). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current lower summer regime (covering mid-April to mid-June). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=9 to account for the reduced volatility in this stable, low-demand period. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the backend OR logic will target using these stats.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees lower demand in summer months. Looking at the demand history, there has been a steady decline: April averaged ~35, May ~34, and June has averaged ~20 (P17-P19 are 17, 30, and 13 respectively). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 order arriving in P19). We currently have 35 units on-hand and 108 units in-transit (P16: 46, P17: 26, P18: 7, P19: 29). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 143 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand mean of ~20-25 units per period. Since holding costs and profits are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, represented by a base stock equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat with N=5 (P15-P19) to capture this recent summer demand drop. I'm keeping L at default (4) as the data shows stability.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand low confirmed: June demand (P17-P19) dropped significantly to an average of ~20 units/period, compared to May's average of ~34.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand for 'Basic sweatpants' (a heavy jersey fabric with soft brushed inside) has logically declined as summer progresses. The average demand in June (P17-P20) was approximately 17 units/period (17, 30, 13, 8), which is a significant drop from the May average (~34). For July, I expect this low-demand regime to persist or slightly decrease further as temperatures remain high. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent June/July transition. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand (73) + In-transit (62) = 135 units. Given that (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at ~17 units/period is only ~85 units, we are currently overstocked relative to current demand, so the OR engine will likely order 0. I will keep sigma_hat on default to allow for some safety buffer in case of mid-summer spikes or early autumn interest.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime: June data (P17-P20) confirms a drop to an average of ~17 units/period, down from May's ~34, aligning with seasonal expectations for heavy loungewear.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants with a soft brushed inside, which is seasonally out of favor during the summer months. Historical demand confirms this: June (P17-P20) saw an average demand of ~17 units/period, and the most recent demand (P21) was 13 units. The Carry-over Insights indicate a sustained downward shift in demand since June. My on-hand inventory (86 units) plus in-transit inventory (36 units) totals 122 units. Given the low summer demand, this is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) period window (4+1=5 periods), where total expected demand is only ~85 units at a rate of 17/period. Therefore, no new order is needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) to capture this summer low, and keep L at default as it remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which are currently in a seasonal low during the summer months. Recent demand (P17-P22) has averaged ~16.2 units per period (17, 30, 13, 8, 13, 26), significantly lower than the Spring levels. The most recent demand (P22) was 26, but the 4-week moving average remains near 15. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 67 and in-transit at 29 (total 96), and expected demand for the (L+1)=5 period window estimated around 75-85 units, the current position is sufficient to cover demand without additional ordering, especially given the equal profit and holding costs ($1/$1). I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the summer demand slump while allowing for the slight uptick seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand remains in the summer low regime, with an average of ~16 units/period (P17-P22). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical data (P17-P23) shows that demand for sweatpants has significantly declined during the summer months, reflecting a clear seasonal trough. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is approximately 21.8 units, though recent weeks (P22-P23) have shown a slight uptick (26 and 36 units). However, on-hand inventory is currently 60 units with zero pipeline inventory. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given current inventory levels (60 units) and the persistent summer low regime (avg ~22 units/period, requiring ~110 units for 5 periods), we are slightly under-stocked but must remain cautious of high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) which equals the profit margin. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the summer demand profile for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. We are in the final week of July, moving into August. Historical demand for basic sweatpants (heavy loungewear) shows a significant summer decline. Demand in the last 8 periods (P17-P24) averaged ~20 units/period (values: 17, 30, 13, 8, 13, 26, 36, 11). Although there were brief spikes in P22/P23, the most recent reading (P24) was 11. Given the profit ($1.0) to holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the target service level is 50%, which implies a base stock near the mean. Lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent_N method (N=8) to capture the current summer low-regime average (~20 units) for forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't overstock during the remainder of the summer while maintaining a 4-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P17-P24) confirmed at ~20 units/period average, continuing the summer low pattern for heavy loungewear.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the SKU '547780001' (soft sweatshirt fabric trousers) is emerging from its lowest summer demand regime. Period 25 saw a sudden spike in demand to 63 units, which is significantly higher than the July average of ~20 units. This likely signals the beginning of the 'Back to School' or autumn transition, as jersey basics and loungewear typically see increased demand as temperatures drop or the school season approaches. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 48 units in transit (38 ordered in P24, 10 ordered in P25). The arrival of the P24 order is expected in P28, and the P25 order in P29, assuming the consistent lead time of 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but since the OR engine uses a capped policy (base stock), I must adjust parameters to ensure we do not stock out during this demand inflection. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use only the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend (63 units) while still accounting for the lower July weeks, effectively raising the forecast to anticipate the seasonal shift. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: August 5 (P26) shows potential end of summer low; P25 demand (63) is significantly above July avg (~20).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 547780001 (sweatpants) is exiting the summer low and entering the 'Back to School' and autumn ramp-up period. Period 26 demand (124 units) and Period 25 (63 units) clearly indicate a major demand regime shift upwards (avg demand ~93 over the last 2 periods vs ~20 in July). We are currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Given the sharp spike and the seasonal nature of sweatpants as the weather cools (August/September), I am shifting to an explicit forecast to avoid under-ordering based on trailing averages that are heavily weighted by summer lows. I'll estimate mean demand at 85 units per period to reflect the new regime and recent peaks, ensuring the base stock (L+1=5 periods of demand) covers the anticipated surge. I will maintain a higher sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: August 'Back to School' surge started P25/P26, increasing mean demand from ~20 to ~93 units (+365%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 547780001 (sweatpants) is currently experiencing a significant 'Back to School' demand surge starting Period 25 (Late July/August). Demand has spiked from a summer average of ~20 to 124 in P26 and 212 in P27. The current mean for this new regime (P25-P27) is approximately 133 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this surge. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility accompanying the spike. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning the orders placed during this surge won't arrive until Period 29-32. The in-transit pipeline (272 units) is largely composed of the orders placed in P26 (65) and P27 (159). To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand period, I will maintain the high service level target implied by the OR backend's logic while using the most recent demand data to influence the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Back to School surge (Aug) demand mean for P25-P27 is ~133 units, exhibiting high volatility compared to summer baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 547780001 (sweatpants) is currently in a high-demand 'Back to School' phase, which began around Period 25. Demand has surged from a summer low of ~20 units to a three-period average of ~162 units (Period 26: 124, Period 27: 212, Period 28: 151). The most recent period (P28) saw a demand of 151. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, the pipeline is substantial (491 units), and arrivals are confirmed at a stable lead time of 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). To capture this higher demand regime and prevent stockouts during the current peak, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 4 periods (P25-P28), which encompass the start and peak of this surge. This provides the OR backend with a mean and volatility reflective of the present trend while remaining responsive to the shift from summer lows.

Carry-over insight: Back to School demand regime (late Aug) confirmed high mean: Period 26-28 average demand is 162 units/period, compared to July average of ~20.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context is the late 'Back to School' peak moving into September. Recent demand (P25-P29) has been very high (avg 131.6 units: 63, 124, 212, 151, 108), representing a massive shift from the summer low of ~20. Note that sales have been severely capped by zero on-hand inventory, so 'demand' is the true indicator. Current on-hand is 0, and we have a large pipeline of 678 units. The order placed in P26 (65 units) is expected to arrive during P30 (today), but it won't be visible until P31. For Period 30, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime (avg ~131.6 * (1+4) = ~658). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen in August (std dev ~55 * sqrt(5) = ~123). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals in P28 and P29. This aggressive parameter setting ensures the OR backend maintains a high base stock to recover from stockouts as demand stabilizes at this higher autumn level.

Carry-over insight: Back to School/Autumn demand regime (P25-P29) confirmed with mean demand of ~132 units/period, a 6x increase from summer levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the 'Back to School' and transition to Autumn demand regime. Demand since Period 25 has increased significantly compared to the summer lows: 63, 124, 212, 151, 108, 112. The mean demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 128 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~132 units. We are currently facing a stockout (ending inventory 0 for the last few periods) because current arrivals are fulfilling orders placed during the low-demand late-July period (P24-P26). Pipeline inventory is very high (613 units) due to large orders placed in P27 (159), P28 (257), and P29 (197) to catch up with the demand spike. These large orders are expected to arrive in P31, P32, and P33 respectively. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P30 conclusion (P26 order arrived P30). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime (P25-P30) and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the high volatility seen during this surge.

The current date is September 16, 2019. We are now past the peak of the 'Back to School' (BTS) surge which occurred throughout August (P25-P29). Demand has shown a decline in the last two periods: 112 (P30) and 71 (P31). This suggests the market is transitioning from the extreme BTS peak into a stable Autumn regime. Averaging the demand from the last 7 periods (P25-P31) results in ~120 units/period, but looking at the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) shows a trend of 108, 112, and 71 (mean ~97). To avoid overstocking while demand softens, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak cooling while still respecting the higher Autumn baseline compared to Summer. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P31 arrived order from P27). Inventory position: 88 on-hand + 483 in-transit = 571. With L=4, (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a mean of ~110, we expect ~550 units of demand over the window, so the pipeline is currently well-stocked. sigma_hat is set to 5 periods to reflect the volatility seen during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime transition: Back to School peak (avg ~132) is cooling into Autumn regime; most recent demand (P31: 71) suggests a lower sustained mean than August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). We have moved past the initial 'Back to School' peak (August average ~132) into an Autumn regime. Demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 112, 71, and 58, indicating a clear cooling trend as the peak surge subsides. The mean demand for the most recent two periods is 64.5. On-hand inventory is currently high (287) due to the arrival of the large P28 order (257 units). Pipeline inventory is also significant (309), consisting of orders from P29 (197), P31 (29), and P32 (83). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the downward trend in demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the cooling demand (avg ~80) while sigma_hat will remain calculated from a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the recent volatility during the transition. This approach prevents over-ordering while on-hand inventory is high and demand is stabilizing.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed cooling: average demand for P31-P32 dropped to ~65 units/period from the August peak of ~132.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the Autumn demand regime following the August 'Back to School' peak (which averaged ~132 units/period). Demand in the last three periods (P31-P33) has been 71, 58, and 85, averaging 71.3 units/period. This confirms a stabilization at a lower level than August but higher than the summer low. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 399 and in-transit at 112 (total 511), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current demand mean of ~71 (covering ~7 periods). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce ordering to zero to burn off this excess inventory. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (N=3) to accurately capture the post-peak cooling while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer (sigma_hat) as we approach potential late-autumn/winter shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Period 31-33 average demand is 71 units/period, significantly lower than the August average of 132.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is basic sweatpants, which typically sees a demand increase as the weather cools in autumn. After the 'Back to School' peak in August (avg ~130), demand has stabilized into an Autumn regime. Over the last 4 periods (P31-P34), demand was 71, 58, 85, and 78, averaging 73 units per period. This is a clear cooling from August but remains significantly higher than the mid-summer low of ~20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 321 units and 112 units in transit (expected to arrive in P36 based on P32 order), our current inventory position covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate ( (321+112)/73 \u2248 5.9). Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. We are currently overstocked relative to current demand, so the OR backend should naturally stop ordering. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the stabilized Autumn regime of ~73 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~73 units/period (P31-P34 average), down from the August peak (avg ~132) but higher than summer lows (~20).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the Autumn regime for basic sweatpants. Demand has stabilized following the August 'Back to School' peak. Over the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has been 71, 58, 85, 78, and 77, yielding an average of 73.8 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. Our current inventory position (on-hand 273 + in-transit 83 = 356) comfortably covers estimated demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), particularly as we move deeper into October where demand for sweatshirt fabric products typically remains steady or slightly increases. I will maintain mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (73.8 * 5 \u2248 369) to ensure we don't over-order while keeping enough buffer for the Autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Oct) confirmed stable at ~74 units/period average (P31-P35 evidence).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The 'Back to School' peak (August) has subsided, and demand has stabilized in an 'Autumn' regime. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 71.8 units (71, 58, 85, 78, 77, 62). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My target is to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). With on-hand inventory at 294 and 13 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 307), and an expected demand of ~360 units over the next 5 periods at the current regime (~72 * 5), the system is slightly understocked for the long term but currently has high on-hand levels due to previous large orders. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this stabilized Autumn demand and use recent_N for sigma to capture the current volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the Autumn demand regime. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 73 units per period (71, 58, 85, 78, 77, 62, 80). The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 10.4. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 214 units, with 66 units in-transit (from P36 and P37 orders). Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 280) already covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand at the current rate (280/73), and the target base stock for a (L+1=5) period window would be around 365-400 units, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Back-to-School stabilization while excluding the August peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Oct) confirmed stable at ~73 units/period average with lower volatility (std ~10) compared to the August peak (P31-P37 evidence).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is Nov 4, entering the late-autumn/pre-holiday phase. The 'Autumn' demand regime has been stable since Period 31 (start of September) with a mean of ~74 units/period and relatively low volatility. Historical data for November/December is not in the sample set, but sweatpants generally see sustained or increased demand as weather cools. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 147 on-hand and 151 in-transit (P36, P37, P38 orders), the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering P31-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable autumn regime while being responsive to any early November shifts. L remains at default (4).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, moving into the mid-November/Pre-Holiday season. Historically (P31-P39), demand for these basic sweatpants has stabilized at an Autumn mean of ~73 units per period (Avg of P31-P39 = 71.3). However, we are entering the period leading up to Black Friday and the winter peak for heavy jersey loungewear, where demand for this SKU typically increases. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 80, 67, 66) is steady. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 81 with 215 in-transit (Total pipeline = 296). Given lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. If we assume the current mean of ~73 holds or slightly increases, we need ~365 units to cover the pipeline. My current pipeline (296) is slightly below this, and with high seasonal probability for an uptick in late Nov/Dec, I will maintain the mu_hat based on the stable Autumn regime (N=9, starting from P31) to sustain current stock levels while allowing the OR engine to account for recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are entering the late Autumn/pre-Holiday season. Historically, demand has stabilized around 73 units/period (P31-P40 mean = ~71). Recent demand (P37-P40: 80, 67, 66, 61) is very consistent, showing a slight cooling but remaining significantly higher than summer lows. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand is low (33), but in-transit is high (264), including pending orders from P37 (53), P38 (85), P39 (64), and P40 (62). The order from P37 should arrive in P41 (visible in P42). Because we are approaching the end of the year and transition into winter/holiday, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the stable Autumn mean while staying sensitive to the most recent cooling trend. The OR backend needs to maintain a safety stock that balances the high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($1).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are entering the Black Friday and winter holiday season. Historically, this SKU (sweatpants) showed a significant demand surge during the 'Back to School' period (August), peaking at avg ~162 units/period, and then settled into an 'Autumn' regime of avg ~73 units/period (P31-P38). Recent demand (P39-P41: 66, 61, 74) remains consistent with this Autumn baseline. However, calendar knowledge suggests a potential spike for Black Friday (Nov 29) which falls within the current lead-time window. Pipeline inventory is currently 267 against an on-hand of 12. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the next few periods cover late November and December, I will maintain the Autumn regime mean for forecasting but use a higher service level or slightly elevated mu_hat via recent_N to ensure we aren't stocked out by a holiday surge. I will use N=11 (P31-P41) to capture the stable post-peak autumn demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02. We are entering the peak holiday season for sweatpants (soft jersey loungewear). Historically, demand for this SKU has shown significant shifts: a summer low (~20), a 'Back to School' peak in August (~132), and a stable Autumn period (P31-P40, avg ~71). However, Period 41 and 42 show demand rising to 74 and 91 respectively, indicating the start of a winter/holiday surge. I will use the recent mean of these two surges to forecast for the (L+1) window. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 units on hand and a holiday demand spike expected, the goal is to maintain high service levels. I will use mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (avg ~75) to capture the upward trend and set L to default.

Carry-over insight: Winter/Holiday demand surge detected starting Period 41: demand increased from Autumn avg ~71 to 82.5 avg in P41-P42 (+16%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season (Period 44, Date 2019/12/09). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 43 noted a Winter/Holiday demand surge starting at Period 41, but demand in Period 43 dropped to 51, which is lower than the Autumn average. This creates uncertainty as we approach the end of the year. However, typically sweatshirt products (garment lower body, soft brushed inside) maintain higher demand in cold weather. Our pipeline inventory is healthy (287 units in-transit), but on-hand is low (19). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent fluctuation (P41: 74, P42: 91, P43: 51), I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this holiday volatility while ensuring we don't over-react to the single-period dip in Period 43. This N=3 window balances the recent high demand with the current drop, resulting in an average of 72 units/period, which aligns with the previous Autumn baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday period (P45, Dec 16). Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) has averaged 70.25 units, which is a slight increase from the Autumn baseline (~73) if we include the recent P42 peak (91). Although there was a dip to 51 in P43, seasonal expectation for sweatpants in December remains high. The 'Winter/Holiday surge' noted in Carry-over Insights (starting P41) is still active. Inventory is low (16 on-hand), but a large pipeline (279 units) is expected to arrive starting this period (P41 order due P45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the late-year demand level and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for higher volatility observed during the transition into winter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which coincides with the Christmas holiday peak. Period 45 demand spiked significantly to 118 units, confirming a major holiday surge for this jersey-based/sweatpants product. This surge has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. Historical data from P41-P45 shows a sharp increase in mean demand. We are currently in a high-demand regime that likely includes post-holiday lounging. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this December surge (average ~80 units/period), and since the product is seasonally sensitive 'soft sweatshirt fabric', I will apply an explicit mu_hat to ensure coverage for the current peak (estimating a forecast of ~90 per period for the L+1 duration). Lead time has remained rock-solid at 4 periods throughout the game history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during the December surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Winter peak confirmed for late Dec: Period 45 demand jumped to 118 units. Average demand for P41-P45 (mid-Nov to mid-Dec) rose to ~80 units/period, compared to the Autumn mean of ~73.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30, following the peak holiday period where demand surged significantly (P45: 118, P46: 153). While some post-holiday cooling is expected in January, historical data from Jan 2019 (pre-game samples: 121, 57, 75, 63) suggests demand remains relatively high compared to autumn levels. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the holiday stockouts, and pipeline inventory is 337 units. Based on P43-P46 (last 4 periods), mean demand is 96.75 units/period. Over the lead time (L=4), we expect ~484 units of demand (96.75 * 5). The 337 units in transit are insufficient to cover this expected demand plus a safety buffer for volatility. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend from mid-November through the holiday peak (avg ~92) to set the base stock level, ensuring we recover from the current stockout and prepare for the 2020 post-holiday transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand (late Dec) confirmed: demand rose to 153 units in P46. Dec average (P43-P46) is ~97 units/period, significantly higher than Autumn avg of ~73.
