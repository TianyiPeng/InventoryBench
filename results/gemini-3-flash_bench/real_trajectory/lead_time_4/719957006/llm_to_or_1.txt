Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 719957006 (Women's Hipster briefs). There is no history of arrivals yet, so we assume the promised lead time (L=4) holds. The demand history for the last 5 weeks shows 140, 45, 30, 95, 99. The mean of these 5 samples is 81.8 and the standard deviation is 44.4. Given the date (mid-February), we are past the initial January surge/clearance logic and entering a more stable period for basics like cotton jersey briefs. Because we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need a robust initial order to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the most recent demand pattern while ignoring older outliers if they existed (though here we only have 5 samples total).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Womens Lingerie'. Current on-hand is 0, with 155 units in-transit from Period 1. The demand in Period 1 was 21. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks) are 140, 45, 30, 95, 99. The average of these 5 samples is 81.8. While the Period 1 demand (21) is lower than the average, it's consistent with the variability seen in January (which dropped from 140 to 45). Promised lead time (L) is 4. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-volume January/February regime while the OR engine manages the pipeline. L is set to default as we have no information suggesting the promised 4-period lead time is inaccurate yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is cotton hipster briefs (staple lingerie). Current on-hand is 0, with a pipeline of 274 units. Period 1 and 2 both resulted in stockouts due to starting with 0 inventory. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution flow, orders placed in Period 1 (155 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The recent demand samples (140, 45, 30, 95, 99) show significant variance, but the average is approximately 81.8. Given the stockouts in P1/P2 (demand 21 and 29), combined with pre-history, the demand seems to be stabilizing lower than the initial spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this recent behavior while maintaining the default lead time settings. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is Women's Lingerie (Hipster briefs). Historical demand samples showed higher numbers in Jan (peaks of 140, 95) vs. recent conclude periods (21, 29, 53). However, the conclude data only shows 'sold=0' because on-hand inventory has been 0 since the start. The 'demand' reported in game history (21, 29, 53) reflects the lost sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 347 (155+119+73). Including the 5 initial samples + 3 game history samples, we have 8 data points. Mean demand is approx 65. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4) periods. Using recent_N=5 (99, 21, 29, 53, and a projected demand for the current period) to capture the lower recent trend while maintaining a buffer for the stockouts observed. I will use L=4 (default) and recent_N=5 for mu and sigma since we are still early in the game and waiting for the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is Women's Lingerie (Hipster briefs). Looking at historical demand (including the provided seed samples), there is a significant increasing trend: 140, 45, 30, 95, 99 (seed) followed by observed demand of 21, 29, 53, and 121 in periods 1-4. The jump from 53 to 121 in early March suggests a seasonal shift or growing popularity. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 366 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (155 units) should arrive during Period 5 (this period) and be visible in the next status update, as 4 periods have passed since P1's decision. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent accelerating demand trend (average ~56 in the last 4 weeks, but the most recent 121 suggests we need to be aggressive). To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), I'll rely on the OR backend's default calculation but use the last 4 observed samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high volatility and mean shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from ~20-30 units/week to 121-145 units/week over the last few samples, likely reflecting seasonal growth or a ramp-up phase. The period 1 order arrived in period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand for the last two periods (P4/P5) averaged 133 units. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this recent spike more accurately than a long-term average, as the early demand samples (20-30 range) are no longer representative. L will remain 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 4: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~130+ units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing historical data: Period 4 saw a significant jump in demand (121), followed by Period 5 (145) and Period 6 (93). These three data points confirm a clear upward shift compared to the initial samples (avg ~64) and Period 1-3 (21, 29, 53). Mean demand for the last 3 periods is 119.7 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and conclude messages for Period 5 and 6 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Current inventory is 36 (on-hand) + 277 (in-transit) = 313. To maintain service levels for a regime averaging ~120 units/week, we set mu_hat based on the recent 3 samples. sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: early samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~68 units, but from Period 4 onwards, demand spiked significantly (121, 145, 93, 34). Although Period 7 showed a dip to 34, the average demand over the last 4 periods is ~98. Given the product is women's cotton hipster briefs, we may be seeing spring seasonality. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7. Inventory levels are currently stable with 75 on-hand and a large pipeline (367 units), including an order of 19 from P4 arriving in P8 and 185 from P6 arriving in P10. For the OR parameters: L is set to default (4 periods). mu_hat uses recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~98) while smoothing the recent outlier of 34; specifically, (1+L)*98.25 = 491.25. sigma_hat uses recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is women's cotton hipster briefs. Historically, we saw a demand surge in Periods 4-6 (avg ~120), but demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (Period 7: 34, Period 8: 8). This suggests the previous demand regime shift noted in carry-over insights was likely temporary or seasonal. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Periods 1-4 all arrived exactly at L=4). Currently, we have 488 units in transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, and 8) and 86 on-hand. Given the sudden drop in demand, we need to lower our forecast (mu_hat) to avoid excessive holding costs, as the pipeline is already very full relative to recent demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent cooling of demand while maintaining the promised lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Periods 4-6 has reversed; demand in Periods 7-8 dropped to an average of 21 units/period, suggesting a return to a lower demand profile.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The historical promised lead time is 4 periods, and all concluded arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. The demand for the last three periods (Periods 7, 8, 9) was 34, 8, and 31, averaging 24.3 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 9 that the high-demand spike seen in Periods 4-6 (averaging ~120) has subsided. Currently, we have 55 units on-hand and 488 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, and 8). Since lead time is 4, the order from Period 6 is expected to arrive during the current Period 10. To avoid excessive holding costs from the large pipeline (488 units) relative to the current low demand (~24/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (capturing the low demand phase) and maintaining the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand over the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 24.3, significantly lower than the P4-P6 spike of ~120.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). History confirms a lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P6 arrived P10). Demand has stabilized after a mid-March spike (P4-P6 averaged ~120). Demand for the last 4 periods (P7-P10) has been 34, 8, 31, and 66, averaging 34.75 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 174, and there are 303 units in transit (ordered in P7 and P8), both arriving over the next two periods. The pipeline inventory (477) greatly exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1 = 5) based on the current regime (~174 units), making further ordering unnecessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the post-spike demand level and keep L at default (4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in Period 12 (late April). Historically, we saw a demand spike in March (Periods 4-6, mean ~120) which has since subsided. Demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 31.6 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P9-P11) show a very stable low mean of 38.6 if we include P10's slight uptick, or ~25 excluding it. Currently, inventory is very high (On-hand: 318) due to large orders placed during the high-demand regime arriving now. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 140) consists of the P8 order, which is expected to arrive this period (P12) based on the consistent 4-period lead time observed in history. Given the current on-hand inventory (318) already covers nearly 10 periods of recent average demand (31.6), and another 140 units are arriving, we are significantly overstocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime and prevent further ordering by the OR backend until inventory levels normalize. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is Women's Lingerie (Hipster briefs). Historical demand showed a peak in March (Periods 4-6, mean ~120), followed by a significant drop and stabilization (Periods 7-12, mean ~30). Recent demand in the last 6 periods has been 34, 8, 31, 66, 19, 10, averaging 28 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (448 units) due to large orders placed during the March peak arriving now, while demand has concurrently cooled off. With an expected demand of ~28-30 per period and a (L+1)=5 period horizon, needed inventory is approximately 150-200 units. Since on-hand (448) far exceeds this, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from over-ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) of post-peak demand to reflect the current low-demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in a very low demand phase following a temporary spike in March. Demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 66, 19, 10, and 3, respectively, averaging 24.5 units per week. However, the most recent weeks (P11-P13) show an even sharper decline, averaging only 10.6. With an on-hand inventory of 445 units and no units in transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels. The holding cost is $1.0 vs. a profit of $4.0. To minimize holding costs while the backend handles the excess inventory, I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the post-spike stabilization while acknowledging the recent very low values. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a sustained low level post-March spike; last 3 periods average 10.7 units/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' spiked in March but has since significantly declined and stabilized at a very low level. The last 5 periods (P10-P14) show demand units of 66, 19, 10, 3, and 2, which is a clear downward trend towards near-zero demand as the season passes. Our on-hand inventory is 443 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate (average of ~10 units over the last 5 periods), we have more than enough inventory to cover the next 40+ periods. The holding cost is $1.0/unit, making excess inventory expensive. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand stabilization and decline, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels to prevent further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spike has effectively collapsed: Period 10-14 average is 20.0, but the last 3 periods (P12-P14) average only 5.0 units/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (women's lingerie) is experiencing a severe post-peak demand slump. After a significant spike in March (Periods 4-6 averaging ~120), demand has collapsed. The recent 5 periods (P11-P15) show an average demand of only 7.4 units/period, with the last 3 periods (P13-P15) averaging a mere 2.67. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 440 units, which, at current demand levels, represents over 100 weeks of stock. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the profit is $4.0/unit, the high inventory level is generating significant holding costs that far outweigh the risk of stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all resolved orders from P1-P4 and P6-P8 showed a lead time of 4). To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders and to allow the current massive surplus to diminish, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 5-period window to reflect the current low-demand regime, while keeping L at the default (promised) value.

Carry-over insight: Sustained very low demand regime confirmed: Period 11-15 average is 7.4 units/period, down from peak of ~120 in March.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p) is currently in a very low demand phase following a significant peak in March. Period 16 showed a slight increase in demand (68 units), but the overall trend from Period 11 to Period 15 was extremely low (averaging ~7 units). Our current on-hand inventory of 372 units is significantly more than enough to cover projected demand for the next (L+1) periods, given the promised lead time of 4. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. a profit of $4.0, the OR engine will seek a service level around 80%. Given the recent volatility and the massive stock surplus, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the post-peak environment while acknowledging the P16 spike. No new orders are expected or needed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is Women's Lingerie (3-pack cotton hipsters). Demand has been consistently low following a significant spike in March, though Period 16 showed a temporary increase (68 units), followed by a return to 22 units in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 350 units, which is extremely high (over 10 periods of coverage) given the recent average demand (approx. 20-30 units/period). Lead times have been stable at the promised 4 periods. The primary objective is to avoid adding to the already excessive inventory, which is incurring a $1.0/unit holding cost. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using method 'recent_N' with N=3, we capture the most recent demand profile (avg ~31) while allowing the on-hand inventory to deplete naturally. The OR backend will not place new orders because on-hand inventory (350) far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand remains volatile at a low-to-moderate level post-spike (P16: 68, P17: 22). Inventory levels are currently excessive (350 units) relative to recent mean demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs, which generally shows stable demand but experienced a significant spike in March/April before collapsing to very low levels. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has been 3, 2, 3, 68, 22, and 2. While P16 and P17 showed a brief uptick, the average over the last 6 periods is only ~16.7 units/period. Current on-hand inventory is 348 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Even using a conservative average of 20 units/period, the required inventory would be around 100 units. With 348 units on hand, the SKU is heavily overstocked. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and stop ordering, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime. This will result in a base stock level well below current on-hand inventory, effectively halting new orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie - Hipster briefs) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime following a significant peak in March. In Period 20 (late June), on-hand inventory is 344 units, while the recent 7-period average demand (P13-P19) is approximately 14.9 units per week. Although there was a brief spike to 68 units in Period 16, demand has since returned to very low levels (2 and 4 units in the last two periods). With over 20 weeks of coverage based on recent averages and a promised lead time of 4 periods, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect this low-demand state and rely on the OR backend's natural order suppression due to high on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to calculate as observed arrivals consistently match the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand (since Period 13) has stabilized at a low average of ~15 units/period, despite a single-period outlier in Period 16. Current inventory (344) provides excessive coverage for this regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product (Womens Lingerie) experienced a significant demand spike in March/April which has since collapsed. Demand over the last 8 periods (P13-P20) has averaged only 13.4 units/period, with the last 3 periods averaging just 3.0 units. On-hand inventory is currently 341 units, which at the recent average of ~13 units/period, provides over 26 periods of cover. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, minimizing further inventory is paramount. The goal is to set the base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) significantly below the current on-hand inventory (341) to ensure the OR engine places zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (capturing the post-spike stabilization period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low-demand reality. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime following a significant peak in March (early periods). The current date is July 8th. Mean demand over the last 10 periods (P12-P21) is approximately 14.5 units per period, with significant variance (notably 68 units in P16 and 28 units in P21). On-hand inventory is currently 313 units, which provides over 20 periods of coverage at the current mean demand rate. There is zero 'In-transit' inventory. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the extreme overstock position, the objective is to prevent any further ordering until the inventory level normalizes. By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) and a default lead time, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will remain significantly below the current on-hand level (313), resulting in zero orders. This strategy prioritizes reducing holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are observing a significant demand spike (Period 21: 28 units, Period 22: 104 units) following a long period of stagnation. This suggests a potential summer seasonality or clearance effect for this 'Ginger cotton hipster' lingerie item. Despite this spike, our on-hand inventory is still 209 units, which is high. Comparing the mean demand of the last 4 periods (~35 units/period) against our stock, we have approximately 6 periods of coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this recent uptick in volatility and volume, ensuring the OR backend updates the base stock level. However, given the high on-hand inventory and the risk of holding costs if the spike is transient, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a zero order, which is appropriate until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike detected starting Period 21: Demand increased from a 5-period average of ~10 units to a 2-period average of 66 units (+560%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed high-demand regime that began around Period 21. Demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 28, 104, and 111 respectively, averaging 81 units per period. This is a significant departure from the previous low-demand regime (which averaged ~15 units). The product is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p', a staple lingerie item, and the current date (late July) aligns with mid-summer. Given the profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. The on-hand inventory has dropped rapidly to 98 units with 55 units in-transit (ordered P23). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. To ensure we capture the current sales momentum without over-estimating based on the single low data point (P21), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~15 to 81 units/period over the last 3 periods (P21-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 21. Demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) was 28, 104, 111, and 100, averaging 85.75 units/period. The current inventory is 0 on-hand, with 212 units in-transit (ordered in P23 and P24). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, these arrivals will not reach the inventory until P27 and P28 respectively. The product is currently in a stockout situation, having lost demand in P24. To maximize profit and capture this summer demand spike (late July), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=4 to reflect this high demand regime (mean ~85.8). Lead time (L) remains calculated as history shows a consistent 4-period fulfillment.

Carry-over insight: July demand spike confirmed: Demand has averaged 85.8 units/period from P21-P24, representing an 8x increase from the May-June average of ~10 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a major July/August demand spike, with demand averaging 86.8 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), peaking around 100. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 362 in-transit. The order placed in P23 (55 units) is expected to arrive during the next period (P27) based on the promised lead time of 4 periods. However, recent demand (P24-P25) has already resulted in stockouts. To maximize service levels during this high-demand summer regime, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 5-period window (P21-P25) to capture this specific seasonal spike. L is set to calculate to monitor for any supply chain delays.

Carry-over insight: July/August seasonal demand spike confirmed: Mean demand from P21-P25 is 86.8 units/period, compared to the May/June average of ~15 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained July/August demand spike for SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie/Hipsters). The mean demand from Period 21 to 26 has averaged 91.3 units/period (28, 104, 111, 100, 91, 116). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant lost sales in Period 25 and 26 due to stockouts. There is a large pipeline (498 units) consisting of orders from P23 (55), P24 (157), P25 (150), and P26 (136). Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods and historical performance (all arrivals to date have followed L=4), the P23 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 27 (visible in Period 28). To cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period (total L+1=5), and accounting for the current elevated demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current spike while the pipeline catches up. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals have consistently confirmed the promised 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime (July/August spike), with demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) averaging 108.2 units per period (111, 100, 91, 116, 123). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out the Period 23 arrival. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). To capture this high demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current mean demand of ~108 units. This results in a base stock calculated over (L+1)=5 periods. Pipeline inventory is 465 units (orders from P24-P27), which against a 5-period demand forecast of ~540 units suggests we need to maintain consistent ordering to avoid further stockouts during this peak seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from P23-P27 is 108.2 units/period, roughly 10x the May-June average.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. We are in a confirmed high-demand regime for this product (Womens Lingerie/Hipster briefs), which began around Period 22 (July). Demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has been extremely consistent, averaging 106.6 units/period (100, 91, 116, 123, 103). The promised lead time of 4 periods is holding steady, as evidenced by Period 23 and Period 24 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later in P27 and P28 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 54, with 409 units in transit (P25, P26, P27, P28 orders). To sustain the service level during this high-demand summer/back-to-school peak, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's stability and volume (approx 107 units/period). Lead time methodology remains 'calculate' as the 4-period window is currently stable.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stable: Period 24-28 demand average is 106.6 units/period, showing significant consistency throughout August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 21). Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has been consistently high, averaging 106.2 units per period (91, 116, 123, 103, 98). The inventory situation has stabilized with recent arrivals from Period 24 and 25 orders finally replenishing the stock; however, the pipeline must be maintained to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (P23 arrived at P27, P24 at P28, P25 at P29). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stable high-demand regime, as it represents the most accurate current forecast for the late-summer/early-autumn period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 21) and has continued through August and into early September. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 93.0 units/period (116, 123, 103, 98, 74). While the most recent demand sample (74) is lower than the preceding weeks, it is consistent with a stabilizing high-demand profile rather than a collapse. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the completions of orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). Currently, we have 168 units on-hand and 314 units in-transit (ordered in P27, P28, P29, and P30). With a lead time of 4, our 'base stock' needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the 5-period average of 93 units, the required pipeline is ~465 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 482 units, which is slightly above the target. Therefore, L is set to calculated, and mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand summer/seasonal regime while allowing for the slight tapering observed in the last period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 21). While the mean demand peaked around 110 units/period in mid-August, the most recent three periods (P29-P31) show a slight moderation to an average of 80.3 units (98, 74, 69). This suggests the peak summer seasonality may be tapering off as we move into mid-September. Inventory management is stable: lead times are consistent at 4 periods, and pipeline inventory (360) plus on-hand (121) is sufficient. I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand level while reflecting the recent downward trend from the August peak. This results in mu_hat = (1+4) * mean(98, 74, 69, 103, 123) = 5 * 93.4 = 467. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a sufficient base stock level to cover the remaining high demand while avoiding excessive holding costs as the season potentially cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed: Mean demand decreased from ~108 (P23-P27) to ~80 units/period (P29-P31) as of mid-September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) has shown a clear tapering trend as we move into late September. After a high-demand peak in August (averaging ~107 units/period), the last four periods (P29-P32) have seen demand totals of 98, 74, 69, and 53, resulting in a recent average of 73.5. This decline aligns with the end of the summer seasonal peak mentioned in carry-over insights. Currently, there is 169 units on-hand and 287 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A 5-period demand forecast based on the recent downward trend (N=4) suggests a total mean demand of approximately 367.5 units. With current on-hand + pipeline inventory totaling 456 units, we are well-covered. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this tapering regime while maintaining a calculate method for L as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Average demand has dropped from ~107 (P24-P28) to ~74 (P29-P32), a decrease of approx 30% as the summer season ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant seasonality. After a summer peak in July/August (avg ~107 units), demand is transitioning into a lower autumn regime. Despite a surprise spike in Period 33 (138 units), the preceding four periods (P29-P32) averaged 73.5 units, confirming a general downward trend from the peak. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With 126 units on-hand and 192 in-transit (covering orders from P30-P32), current total pipeline inventory is 318. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the transition) captures the recent average of ~86 units/period. Over (L+1)=5 periods, this implies a base stock requirement of ~432. The system will likely place a small replenishment order to cover the recent P33 spike, while the capped policy prevents over-ordering during this tapering phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand tapering confirmed: Despite a single-period spike in P33 (138), the 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~86 units/period, down from the August peak average of ~107.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Historical data and recent activity confirm a seasonal pattern: a high-demand spike in July/August (avg ~107) followed by a gradual tapering starting in September. The last 6 periods show a mean demand of ~81.2. Although P33 saw a spike (138), P34 returned to 75. Given the product (cotton hipster briefs), we are transitioning from summer peak into mid-autumn where demand typically stabilizes at a lower level than summer but remains higher than the May/June 'collapse' (avg ~10). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set N=6 for demand forecasting (covering the post-August period) to capture the current downward trend without overreacting to the single P33 spike. On-hand (147) and in-transit (237) are sufficient to cover current demand, but we need to sustain the pipeline as the October/November period stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization post-summer: Mean demand from Period 30-34 is 81.8 units/period, confirming a ~25% decrease from the August peak (avg ~107).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for the Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p (Womens Lingerie) has shown a clear seasonal pattern: peaks in March (P4-P5) and Summer/August (P21-P29). We are currently in a post-summer tapering phase. Period 35 demand dropped significantly to 20 units. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 65.2. However, the drop in P35 suggests we are entering a lower-demand autumn regime. Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31-P35). On-hand inventory is 195, and in-transit is 264 (total pipeline 459). Given the recent demand drop and typical autumn trends, I will use a conservative 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift while maintaining some buffer against volatility observed in P33. L remains 'calculate' given the high consistency.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand drop confirmed: Period 35 demand (20) is significantly below the late-September average (81.8), indicating a likely seasonal shift into a lower-demand autumn regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-October/Autumn period where demand has significantly dropped from the summer peak (avg ~107) to a much lower level (P35: 20, P36: 7). The 3-period average (P34-P36) is 34 units/period, but the most recent two periods suggest a faster decline towards the low-regime previously seen in May/June (avg ~15). The current inventory position is very high: 216 units on-hand plus 236 units in-transit (total 452). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we are covered for over 13 periods even at a moderate demand of 34 units/period, and much longer if demand settles at ~15. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-period window (N=4) to capture the cooling trend while preparing for potentially low-but-volatile autumn demand, and using the default lead time. No new ordering is expected from the backend due to the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed: Decisive drop from late-September average (~82) to October average (Period 35-36 avg: 13.5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) has clearly entered a low-demand autumn/winter regime. Following a high-demand summer peak (July-August avg ~107 units), demand has dropped significantly over the last three periods: P35=20, P36=7, P37=3. The current on-hand inventory (213) and in-transit units (236) are extremely high compared to this new low-demand environment. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the inventory surplus (approx. 449 units total coverage versus a current demand mean of ~10), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the rapid decline in demand and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we draw down existing stock. No new orders are expected or needed for several periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained low-demand regime for late October: Mean demand from P35-P37 is 10.0 units/period, a massive decrease from the summer peak and September transition levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), and demand has definitively collapsed from the summer peak (July-September). The last four periods (P35-P38) show demand of 20, 7, 3, and 3, respectively, confirming a low-demand autumn regime (mean ~8 units). Current on-hand inventory is 351 units, with an additional 95 units in-transit (ordered P35, expected P40). At current demand levels, the inventory on-hand is equivalent to over 40 weeks of supply. The holding cost is $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit per unit, so carrying excess stock is highly inefficient. No new orders are needed. L is set to default (4), and mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the low-demand regime of October, which prevents the OR engine from ordering based on the high summer average.

Carry-over insight: November demand entry: The low-demand regime observed in October (P35-P38 mean: 8.25) persists into early November, confirming the end of the seasonal peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/11. The SKU (Hipster briefs) has entered a sustained low-demand regime following the autumn seasonal drop. High demand from the summer (averaging ~107) has completely subsided. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has been extremely low: 20, 7, 3, 3, 3 (average 7.2 units/period). Inventory is currently very high at 443 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. This inventory level covers over 60 periods of demand at the current rate. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods (as recent arrivals have been consistent). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, which will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while historical summer data is still in the long-term window.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (November) remains consistent: Period 35-39 average demand is 7.2 units/period, confirming a full transition out of the summer/early-autumn peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU has entered a sustained low-demand regime following the summer/early-autumn peak. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 9.3 units per period (20, 7, 3, 3, 3, 20). The high on-hand inventory of 423 units is far more than enough to cover several months of demand at the current rate (covering ~45 periods). There are no units in-transit, and the actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, no orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime observed over the last 6 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock Calculation remains minimal.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in Period 42. Period 41 demand saw a massive spike to 135 units, which is a significant deviation from the low-demand regime observed from Period 35-40 (average ~10). This spike matches the timing of 'Black Friday' / 'Cyber Monday' sales traditionally occurring in late November. The on-hand inventory is 288 units. Given L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for Periods 42 through 46. The spike in P41 likely signals a short-term high-demand window (Holiday Peak). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method to forecast this holiday demand while acknowledging that the spike might be short-lived. Current inventory (288) is sufficient if demand stays around 130/period for a couple of weeks, but and I will not place new orders yet to avoid excess inventory post-holiday, as the OR backend will calculate that 288 units covers approximately 2-3 periods of this high-demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late November demand spike detected (P41: 135 units), likely corresponding to Black Friday / Cyber Monday. This interrupts the low-demand autumn regime (P35-P40).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand holiday regime. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike of 308 units (likely Cyber Monday), following a 135-unit spike in Period 41 (Black Friday). This has completely depleted the on-hand inventory. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the most recent demand spike (P41-P42) is much higher than the historical average or even the summer peak, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this holiday surge (incorporating P40's 20, P41's 135, and P42's 308). This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of 154.3 units per period. The OR backend will use these parameters to place an order that covers (L+1) periods of this elevated demand, adjusted for the 201 units already in-transit from the Period 42 order. High sigma_hat via recent_N is also necessary to account for the extreme volatility observed during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 41-42 demand (avg 221.5) is significantly higher than the summer peak (avg ~107) and the October/November low (avg ~7). On-hand inventory was fully depleted in Period 42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday shopping season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand in Period 41 (135 units) and Period 42 (308 units) confirmed a massive spike likely linked to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Although Period 43 demand dropped to 87 units, this is still significantly higher than the October/November baseline (~7 units) and we are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). We have 594 units in-transit (201 ordered in P42, 393 in P43). The P42 order is expected to arrive in Period 46 (L=4). To capture the remaining December demand and potential post-holiday sales, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent holiday average and a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (0 to 308 range). This ensures the OR engine maintains a high base stock to capture sales, while the backend 'cap' mechanism will prevent over-ordering as we approach the game's end (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 41-42 demand (avg 221.5) followed by Period 43 (87) indicates high December volatility compared to autumn baseline (~7).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Demand in Period 41 (135), Period 42 (308), Period 43 (87), and Period 44 (83) confirms a massive surge compared to the October/November baseline (~7 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have significant pipeline inventory (948 units) ordered recently (P42: 201, P43: 393, P44: 354). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P42 order is expected to arrive in Period 46. For the current decision (Period 45), we must set parameters to cover the remaining holiday demand and potential early January residuals. I'm using a recent window of 4 periods (P41-P44) to capture this high-demand regime, where mean demand is approximately 153 units/period. The standard deviation is also high due to the Black Friday spike (308). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this current volatility and prevents under-ordering before the window closes, while the 948 units in transit buffer against the stockout.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: Mean demand from P41-P44 is 153.25 units/period, characterized by high volatility (range 83-308).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/23). Historical demand for the last four periods (P41-P44) has averaged 153.25 units, significantly higher than the autumn baseline, and we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 966 units in-transit. The most recent demand (P45) was 115 units. Because we are at the tail end of December, demand is expected to remain high temporarily before potentially dropping in January (based on the start of the game history where Feb demand was lower). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility peak regime (average demand P41-P45 is ~145.6). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The large in-transit pipeline (966 units) should begin arriving from Period 46 (ordered P42) onwards, eventually covering the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: Mean demand from P41-P45 is 145.6 units/period with high volatility (range 83-308). This regime follows the extremely low Oct/Nov baseline (~7 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Christmas and pre-New Year period (2019/12/30). Historical data shows a clear December holiday peak from Period 41 to 45 (avg ~146 units), followed by a sharp drop in Period 46 (32 units), indicating the seasonal surge is subsiding. However, demand usually remains higher than the October/November 'trough' during January. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The In-transit pipeline of 765 units is quite large, originating from heavy orders placed during the stockout in P43 and P44 (747 units combined). These are expected to arrive in P47 and P48. With on-hand inventory at 169 and a significant pipeline, the OR engine needs to transition to a more conservative base stock. I select mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the holiday regime and the subsequent cooldown, as the backend needs to reconcile the large pipeline against a stabilized forecast. Lead time is set to calculate (4 periods) and sigma is adjusted to reflect the high volatility seen during the December peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Period 46 demand (32) indicates a sharp drop from the December peak (avg ~146), signifying the end of the 2019 holiday shopping season.
