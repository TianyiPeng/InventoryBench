Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we start with no on-hand or in-transit inventory and a promised lead time of 4 periods. The product 'Babette long' is a maternity legging in organic cotton jersey. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows samples: 73, 48, 65, 94, 49, resulting in a mean of 65.8 and a standard deviation of 18.6. There is no clear seasonal trend visible in these five weeks of data, though February is generally a stable month for basics. I will set the base stock parameters to cover the (L+1) = 5 period lead time demand using all current samples. I will use the 'default' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat as there are no observed lead times or regime shifts yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Babette long' leggings (maternity wear). Historical demand samples are [73, 48, 65, 94, 49] and Period 1 demand was 63. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 65.3. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 98 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Since on-hand is 0, we have an immediate stockout. I will set mu_hat based on the average demand (65.3) multiplied by (1+L) = 5, which equals 326.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of historical samples (~16.2) multiplied by sqrt(5) = 36.2. I will use the 'default' methods for now as the demand appears relatively stable around the mean of 65.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is maternity leggings ('Mama'). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the initial orders are still in transit (promised lead time = 4). Historical demand samples (73, 48, 65, 94, 49) show a mean of ~66. In-game demand for Period 1 (63) and Period 2 (88) aligns with this historical range, though 88 is on the high side. Since no orders have reached the 'conclude' phase yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time of 4. Given the high criticality of stockouts for this SKU (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), and the fact that we have 0 on-hand inventory, I will use a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure the base stock covers (1+L) periods of demand effectively. N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat is used to capture the recent in-game demand levels (63, 88), which are slightly higher on average than the historical seed data.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 4, 2019. The product is maternity leggings ('Mama Leggings'), which generally experience stable baseline demand but require consistent inventory due to their utility nature. We are currently in Period 4. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (Feb 11) are expected to arrive during P5 (next period) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message. History shows on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Demand in P1-P3 (63, 88, 84) is slightly higher than the average of the initial samples (average ~66), likely indicating a stable upward trend as we move into the spring season. Because we have no arrivals yet, we cannot infer a change in actual lead time. Total in-transit is 297 units, covering orders from P1, P2, and P3. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (~78) compared to the long-term average (~66), ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*demand is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (Lead time + Review period).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Babette long' leggings for pregnant women (Mama category). Current date is March 11, 2019. Historically, demand over the last 5 weeks has been [73, 48, 65, 94, 49] (pre-game) and [63, 88, 84, 76] (in-game), averaging 71.1 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game started at Period 1, the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (4 periods later) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 398 units are in transit (orders from P1-P4). No orders have arrived yet, which is consistent with the L=4 timeline. I will set L to 'default' (4) as no evidence yet suggests a deviation. For demand (mu_hat), the last 9 samples show a stable mean around 71; using recent_N=9 captures this full recent history (N=9). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=9 to capture current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history confirms this: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4). No orders are overdue. However, we are currently low on stock (13 on-hand) because of the initial 4-period setup delay where we couldn't satisfy demand. Demand across the last 10 periods (including 5 pre-game samples) ranges from 48 to 94, with a mean of 72.7 units/period. The last five periods show a slightly higher mean (approximately 79) compared to the initial five samples (70). We will use a recent N=5 strategy to capture this slight upward shift in demand and use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time since the observed lead time matches the promised one.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity jersey legging (SKU 120129001). We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing historical demand (including the seed data and Periods 1-6), demand is relatively stable, ranging from 48 to 94. The sample mean over all 11 available data points is approximately 75.1. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). On-hand inventory is 25 units, and in-transit inventory is 320 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since demand is stable and lead time matches the promised 4 periods, I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting to capture the current stable regime (N=6, covering all active simulation periods) and 'default' for lead time and sigma. Using L=4, mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4) * mean(recent_6) = 5 * ~81.8 = 409. This ensures the base stock covers demand until the next order arrives.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1, 2019. The product is a maternity legging (Mama jersey), which typically has stable year-round demand but may see slight variations based on spring wardrobe updates. Looking at history, demand over the last 7 periods (63, 88, 84, 76, 85, 82, 54) shows a mean of approximately 76 units. The most recent period saw a drop to 54, but it is too early to call this a sustained regime shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods stands confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Currently, we have 76 units on-hand and 321 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). With L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Average demand ~76 results in a needed base stock around 380-400. Pipeline (321) + On-hand (76) = 397 units total, which is well-aligned with expected demand. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the full recorded history while acknowledging the slight volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8, 2019. We are managing 'Mama' maternity leggings. Historical demand from Jan-Feb (approx. 66/week) and recent game demand (P1-P8 avg approx. 78/week) shows moderate volatility without clear seasonal spikes yet. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8. Current on-hand is 83 units, with 250 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use lead time 'default' (promised=4). For demand (mu_hat), recent data suggests a slightly higher mean than early samples; I'll use recent_N=8 to capture the game history demand average (approx. 78 units/period) for the necessary (L+1)=5 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical variance across all samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a maternity legging ('Mama' category). Historical demand since Feb 11 (Period 1 to Period 9) shows an average of approximately 78 units per week (min 54, max 94). There is no strong evidence of a seasonal trend shift yet, though maternity wear demand is generally stable. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5-9. Current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and in-transit inventory is 338 units (from orders in P6, P7, P8, P9). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual realized lead time, I will use the 'default' lead time setting. For demand (mu_hat), utilizing a recent_N of 9 captures the full history of this season's behavior, which is appropriate for calculating the base stock across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the observed volatility in these samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Mama Leggings', a maternity staple. Observation of Period 11 (2019/04/22) shows on-hand inventory is 89 units. Looking at the history, demand has fluctuated between 48 and 94 units per week, with a recent average (Periods 5-10) of approximately 70.5 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10 all show exactly 4 periods). Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 293 units, which represents orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. Specifically, P7 (106 units) is expected to arrive in Period 11, and P8 (30 units) in Period 12. Since demand is stable and lead time is reliable at 4 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to capture the most recent performance since the first stock arrival in Period 5. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1) periods (approx 350-400 units total system inventory needed), balancing the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a maternity legging ('Mama' jersey leggings). Demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 5-11) has averaged 69.4 units, showing a slight decrease and stabilization compared to the initial weeks. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from Periods 1 through 7). Demand volatility (sigma) is relatively stable. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the more recent, lower demand levels (approx 69/week) compared to the 'all sample' mean, which is higher due to earlier weeks. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect current variance. The lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is maternity leggings ('Mama' leggings), which typically show stable demand but may vary with seasonal garment updates. The current date is May 6, 2019. Reviewing demand history (Period 1-12), the mean demand is approx 67 units/period with a standard deviation of approx 15.7. We have observed a slight downward trend or stabilization in the last 4 periods (57, 51, 63, 68, avg = 59.75) compared to the overall average. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by carry-over insights and validated by all arrivals from Period 5 through 12. Pipeline inventory is currently 249 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12), and on-hand is 94 units. Summed, we have 343 units. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (60.4), the required base stock is roughly 300-330 units. The current inventory position is slightly above the expected base stock level due to recent lower demand, so the OR engine will likely order a small quantity to maintain the buffer. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the cooling demand and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to provide a stable volatility estimate.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 (Maternity Leggings) is currently in Period 14 (mid-May). Historical lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as evidenced by continuous arrivals from P1 through P9). Demand has shown a subtle downward shift starting around Period 9; the average demand for Periods 1-8 was approximately 78.25 units, while the average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped to 61.4 units. Since maternity leggings are stable basics but can vary with season, I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using a recent window of N=5 to reflect this lower-demand regime (approx. 61 units/period) and avoid excessive holding costs. For the OR backend, I'll set L to default (4) and use recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from 78.25 to 61.4 (-21.5%) over the last 5 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are managing a maternity cotton jersey legging SKU. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by 10 consecutive arrivals (Period 5 through Period 14). Demand showed a regime shift at Period 9; prior to Period 9, the average demand was approximately 78.2 units, but from Period 9 to Period 14, the average demand has stabilized at 62.16 units. The current on-hand inventory is 117 units, with 152 in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Since the demand regime change is sustained over 6 periods (N=6), I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on this specific window to avoid over-ordering based on older, higher demand levels. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the historical actual lead times align perfectly with the promised value.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/27. The product is maternity leggings, which typically exhibit stable demand but have shown a downward shift recently. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P5 through P15. As noted in the Carry-over insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 9. Demand since Period 9 has averaged 65.7 units (67, 66, 68, 68, 63, 51, 57), which is lower than the early periods. This trend has continued through Period 15. Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, more stable demand regime. This will help prevent over-ordering as we move through late spring/early summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey Fancy). Current date is June 3, 2019. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (P5 through P16 arrivals). Demand has entered a lower regime since Period 9. The average demand across the last 8 periods (P9-P16) is 60.75 units per week, compared to the earlier average of 79.0. Looking at the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand is even more stable at 61.75. Given the high on-hand inventory (96) and substantial in-transit (197), we need to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this lower, stable demand regime to prevent overstocking as we enter the summer months. I am setting N=8 for mu_hat to capture the shift that began in early April and N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging ('Mama' category), which typically shows stable demand compared to fashion items. Current date is mid-June. Reviewing the history, the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P17). Total demand since Period 9 has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial weeks. Specifically, from Period 9 to 17 (last 9 samples), the mean demand is 61.4 units. Period 17 demand was 67 units, showing no significant seasonal spike for June yet. On-hand inventory is 74, and in-transit is 194. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 268 units. With a lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * 61.4 = 307. Since pipeline (268) is below the expected requirements (~307), an order will be triggered. I will use recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, stable demand regime correctly.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Period 19). The product is a maternity legging ('Mama' jersey fancy). Historical demand analysis confirms a regime shift identified in Period 14; the mean demand has stabilized around 61 units per week since Period 9 (P9-P18 mean = 60.5). Seasonality for basic maternity staples like jersey leggings is generally stable, though we monitor for slight summer dips. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (confirmed by all history up to P18). Pipelines are healthy (249 units in-transit). I will set L to 'calculate' as it successfully mirrors the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to isolate the current demand regime (Periods 9-18) and exclude the higher initial demand seen in early periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging (Mama jersey fancy). Demand has stabilized since Period 9. Over the last 11 periods (P9-P19), the mean demand is 59.8 units/period with a standard deviation of 8.8. The current date is late June, which doesn't present immediate major seasonal spikes for this staple maternity item. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P17, P18, P19). In-transit inventory (236 units) covers the next 4 periods (P16, P17, P18, P19 orders), ensuring a stable pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=11 to capture the current stable demand regime, and maintain L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since Period 9 (average ~60 units/period, std ~9). Lead time consistency at 4 periods persists.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity jersey legging (Mama line). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 16 observations (P1-P16 orders processed). Demand shifted downwards around Period 9. The most recent 12 periods (P9-P20) show a stable demand regime with an average of 57.5 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 11.9. This is a significant decrease from the early periods (P1-P8 average of 78.4). Inventory state at P21: On-hand (91) + In-transit (210) = 301. With an expected demand of ~57.5 and a total protection window of (L+1) = 5 periods, the target stock should be roughly 287-300 units. The pipeline is currently healthy. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this lower but stable demand level precisely. L will remain at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a maternity legging (Mama soft jersey), which typically exhibits stable, non-seasonal demand. We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). Reviewing the history, the demand regime shift identified in Period 14 has stabilized further. Since Period 9, the average demand is approximately 57 units per week, but the last three periods (P19-P21) show a slight softening (47, 30, 39 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent throughout the history (P1-P17 orders all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). On-hand inventory is 94 and in-transit is 198 (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=13 to capture the post-shift regime (Period 9 to 21) which averages ~57 units, calculation: (1+4)*57 = 285. This provides a balance between the slightly lower recent demand and the established regime mean, ensuring we don't over-react to three weeks of lower data while maintaining a safe buffer for this high-margin (Profit/Holding = 19) item.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is jersey leggings for pregnancy (Mama line), which typically has stable year-round demand but can experience slight dips in mid-summer. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (promised = actual). There was a documented demand regime shift at Period 9, where average demand dropped from ~78 to ~60 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has further softened to an average of 44.8 units (58, 47, 30, 39, 50). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the stable regime desde Period 9) is appropriate to capture the mean, but I will adjust N to 5 for demand expectations to account for the most recent lower trend (approx 45 units/period). With 114 units on hand and 162 in transit, the inventory position is strong relative to the recent lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand has shown further softening in the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22), averaging ~45 units compared to the previous post-P9 average of ~60 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Mama' leggings (maternity/basics), which typically show stable but seasonal demand. The current date is late July. Analysis of recent history confirms a sustained demand softening identified in Period 23; the last 6 periods (P18-P23) show an average demand of 42.8 units (58, 47, 30, 39, 50, 33), significantly lower than the P9-P17 average of ~61. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high at 136 units, and pipeline is healthy at 107 units (orders from P20-P22). Given the significant reduction in demand to ~43 units/period and the current supply position (On-hand + In-transit \u2248 243 units), we need to lower our parameters to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the service level for the new regime. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand reduction confirmed from Period 18 to 23: Average demand decreased from ~61 to 42.8 (-30%). Lead time remains consistenly at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $561.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the maternity leggings (120129001) has settled into a lower regime since approximately Period 18. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) is 39.14 units, significantly lower than the P9-P17 average of ~61 units. This aligns with mid-summer seasonality where demand for long leggings can soften compared to spring. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by every order from P1 through P20 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The Current inventory position is high: On-hand is 142 units and In-transit is 75 units (from P21-P24), totaling a pipeline of 217 units. Based on a 5-period horizon (L+1) and the recent demand mean (~40), the target base stock is approximately 200 units. Since current pipeline (217) exceeds this, the OR logic will naturally minimize ordering while we burn off excess inventory. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples to capture this sustained lower demand level and maintain the stable lead time of 4.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Mama' leggings, which typically exhibit stable demand but has recently seen a decline. We are currently in Period 26 (August 5). Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 18. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P18-P25) shows an average demand of 40.8 units per week (min 30, max 58) with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3. This represents a confirmed downward shift compared to the P9-P17 average of ~61 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P21 order arrived in P25). With on-hand inventory at 139 units and in-transit at 75 units, the system currently holds enough to cover approximately 5.2 periods of demand (139/40.8), which is roughly equal to L+1. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects current sales velocity and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging ('Mama'), currently in mid-August. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 18. Comparing the demand in Period 1-17 (avg ~69) vs. Period 18-26 (avg ~41), there is a definitive downward shift. The last 5 periods (P22-P26) have seen an average demand of 39.4 units with a standard deviation of 6.8. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. On-hand inventory is healthy at 129 units, and in-transit is 68 units (orders from P23=0, P24=11, P25=30, P26=27). Given the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, expected demand is roughly 200 units. Pipeline inventory (129 + 68 = 197) is nearly exactly at the required base stock level for the current regime. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the full lower-demand regime since P18.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the maternity leggings (SKU 120129001) has transitioned from a low of ~43 units/period (P18-P25) back to a higher level, with P26 at 44 and P27 spiking to 68 units. This likely reflects a late-summer or 'back-to-routine' seasonal uptick. Average demand over the last 3 periods is ~48.3, but the most recent observation (68) suggests a return towards the P9-P17 baseline of ~61. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the lack of arrival in Period 27 (the Period 23 order was 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' message). I will adopt a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture this rising trend while smoothing the spike, and set lead time to 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected starting Period 26-27: average demand increased from ~43 to 56 (+30%) over the last two weeks, moving back toward the historical baseline of 60.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '120129001' (Maternity leggings) is entering late August (2019/8/26). Following a demand slump between Periods 18-25 (average ~40), demand has rebounded in the last three periods (P26-P28: 44, 68, 49), averaging 53.7. This aligns with the 'back-to-school' and seasonal shift into Autumn for basic apparel like leggings. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Note that the Period 23 order was 0 units, explaining why 'arrived=0' was seen in the Period 27 conclusion. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (std ~12 during this rebound). The OR backend's service level q is high (19/(19+1)=0.95), which is appropriate given current low on-hand inventory (23 units) relative to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound sustained: Period 26-28 average at 53.7 units (+25% vs previous regime), likely driven by early Autumn seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $867.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 (Maternity leggings) is entering early September. We have observed a demand rebound since Period 26, moving away from the summer low (~43 units) back toward the historical baseline. Demand in the last four periods (P26-P29) was 44, 68, 49, and 46 (average 51.75). Given the seasonal transition into autumn, demand for leggings is expected to remain firm or increase further. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. However, a significant gap in arrivals occurred: the order from Period 23 (expected arrival Period 27) appears lost or significantly delayed as 'arrived=0' was reported for P27 and P24/P25 orders arrived subsequently in P28/P29. This loss has depleted on-hand inventory to 7 units. To recover inventory and maintain service levels during the seasonal shift, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current rebound level (51.75 * 5 = 258.75) and sigma_hat (recent_N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition. This will signal the OR backend to place aggressive orders to bridge the inventory gap while accounting for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Potential lost shipment identified. Order from Period 23 (size unknown but likely 0 based on history, though replenishment logic suggests a gap) or a general disruption in the P23-P27 window has resulted in critically low on-hand inventory (7 units). Demand rebound is sustained at ~52 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the product (Maternity Leggings) is experiencing a sharp seasonal demand spike, typical for the start of Autumn. Period 30 saw 95 units of demand, a significant increase from the ~53 units averaged in the previous weeks. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to this spike and the lingering effect of a low-volume order period (P23 order was 0). The pipeline flow has resumed with orders of 44, 68, 75, and 70 units from P27-P30, which are expected in P31-P34 respectively. To address the stockout and the new demand level, I am setting the demand parameters based on the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30), which captures the rebound and the peak (Avg: 60.4 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency, with the 'missing' P23 order confirmed to be 0 units, not a lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed starting Period 30: Demand jumped to 95 units (+75% vs previous rebound average), marking the onset of peak Autumn seasonality for this maternity item.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak Autumn season (mid-September), with demand in the last two periods jumping significantly to 95 and 101 units. This confirms a clear regime shift from the late summer rebound (~50-60 units) to a high-demand phase (~100 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in P30 and P31, where arrivals only partially covered demand. We have 309 units in-transit, with an expected arrival of 68 units (ordered P28) in P32 and 75 units (ordered P29) in P33 based on the consistent 4-period lead time. To capture the current high-demand momentum and prevent further stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 500 (representing a forecast of 100 units/period over the lead+review time of 5 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 50 to allow for high volatility during this seasonal transition. This aggressive stance ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to pull more inventory forward.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal demand regime confirmed starting Period 30: Weekly demand has reached ~100 units (+100% vs late Summer average), consistent with maternity leggings entering Autumn.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has entered a peak seasonal regime driven by Autumn (late September). Recent demand samples from Periods 30-32 are 95, 101, and 65 (average ~87). Period 32 (65 units) appears as a partial stockout effect or a minor dip, but the underlying trend for this category in September remains high. On-hand inventory is critical (3 units), though a large in-transit pipeline (378 units) exists. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (Period 28 order arrived in Period 32). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the seasonal lift (averaging ~77 units/period across the last 4). Sigma_hat will also be set based on this recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the 378 units in-transit satisfy a base stock calculated for (1+L) periods of ~77 unit demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak seasonality confirmed: Average demand for maternity leggings increased to ~87 units/period starting Period 30, up from the late Summer average of ~53.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has entered a peak seasonal regime starting Period 30, coinciding with Autumn (September). Average demand over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 93.75 units, a significant increase from the previous summer average of ~53 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 33 where demand (114) significantly exceeded total supply (78). Although 401 units are in-transit, the immediate priority is to set parameters that capture this high-demand regime to ensure the capped OR policy orders enough to replenish stock and meet the sustained seasonal peak. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current 90+ unit demand level, and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a peak seasonal regime (Autumn seasonality for maternity leggings). Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 91.4 units (95, 101, 65, 114, 82), a significant increase from the previous Summer average. However, the system is struggling with stockouts due to the rapid demand ramp-up; on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are in the middle of a high-demand seasonal peak, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand average (~91 units) and volatility. Setting L=4 (default) implies a base stock coverage for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~91, the expected needed pipeline is ~455 units. Currently, 'In-transit' is 459, which is close to the requirement, but given the stockouts (sold < demand in 4 of the last 5 periods), maintained aggressive ordering parameters are necessary to rebuild a safety buffer for the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has entered a high-demand seasonal regime since Period 30 (Autumn peak). Recent demand observed: P30=95, P31=101, P32=65, P33=114, P34=82, P35=73. The average demand for this peak period (P30-P35) is 88.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P31 order arrived in P35). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (23 units) and in-transit is high (430 units), reflecting recent large orders (P32=137, P33=98, P34=128, P35=67) aiming to catch up with the seasonal surge. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current active seasonal mean (approx 88.3 units/period) and provide the OR backend with parameters that support a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $860.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has transitioned from a sharp Autumn peak (averaging ~100 units around Period 30-33) to a slightly lower but stable level in the most recent periods (P34-P36 demand: 82, 73, 51). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx. 69 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P30->P34, P31->P35, P32->P36). Current on-hand is 109, and in-transit is 350. To set mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full seasonal shift while giving weight to the recent stabilization (P30-P36 average is 83 units). Using N=7 for mu_hat means the backend will estimate (1+4)*83 = 415. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the higher volatility experienced during the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak is tapering towards a stable late-autumn plateau: Average demand decreased from 87 units (P30-P33) to 69 units (P34-P36).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1153.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings peaked around Period 33 (114 units) and has since stabilized at a lower late-autumn level. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand was 82, 73, 51, and 68, averaging 68.5 units. This confirms the 'tapering' insight from Period 37, moving away from the high Autumn peak (average ~87) toward a more stable regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current 68.5 units/period average, which prevents over-ordering as the season progresses. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P30-P33. On-hand inventory is healthy (139 units), and with 289 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the upcoming 4-5 periods of demand at this stabilized rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~68 units/period (P34-P37) following the Autumn peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has stabilized following the Autumn peak (P30-P33). Recent history (P34-P38) shows a more consistent demand regime averaging 66.2 units per period (82, 73, 51, 68, 57). While the seasonal peak is over, maternity wear typically maintains a steady baseline in late autumn/early winter. Current on-hand inventory is high (210 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arrival. Pipeline inventory is also significant (161 units), which includes orders from P35 (67), P36 (57), and P37 (37). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory position (OH+Pipeline = 371) compared to the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods (~330 units), the OR backend should minimize new orders to avoid holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower volatility in this stabilized regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has stabilized at approximately 58 units/period over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), confirming the transition from the Autumn peak into a steady late-autumn regime. Current on-hand inventory is high (220 units) following large arrivals from the peak-season orders, and there is 100 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, and P39 - P38 was a zero order). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the current stable demand, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand level (~58 units/period) and volatility, allowing the OR engine's base-stock logic to naturally deplete the excess inventory before placing significant new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at late-autumn plateau confirmed: Period 34-39 average demand is 64.7 units, showing a significant decrease from the Autumn peak (~87 units) but remaining above the late-summer baseline (~43 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has stabilized at a late-autumn plateau (Period 34-40) with an average of approximately 65 units per period. The recent spikes and peaks of the Autumn season have subsided, and the demand is now relatively consistent. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels are currently high (201 units on-hand), meaning the system will likely order very little or nothing to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (covering Periods 34-40) to accurately reflect this stabilization phase and steer the OR backend towards maintaining a lower, more efficient inventory level for the remaining periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for maternity leggings has stabilized at a late-autumn level. Over the last 8 periods (Period 34 to 41), average demand has been 65.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. This plateau follows the high Autumn peak (~87 units) and is significantly higher than the summer baseline (~43 units). Current on-hand inventory (183) and in-transit units (136) are sufficient to cover current demand, but as we approach the end of the game (Period 47), parameters should reflect the current stabilized regime to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service levels. Actual lead time has remained extremely consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 captures this late-autumn plateau perfectly. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 (Maternity Leggings) is currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). We observe a significant demand spike in Period 42 (129 units), which likely represents a pre-holiday (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) peak. Historical data for November (P39-P41) averaged ~63 units, while Period 42 more than doubled that. We must determine if this is a one-off spike or a sustained shift. Given the item is an organic cotton maternity staple, a spike followed by a moderate stabilization is expected during the December shopping season. On-hand inventory has dropped to 54 units, but there are 184 units in-transit. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the transition from the Autumn plateau into the holiday season, roughly the last 2 months) to capture the higher volume without overreacting solely to the P42 spike. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=13 to account for the increased volatility observed during the transition from the stable 60s into the recent 129 peak. This balances the risk of stockouts during the final weeks of the year against holding costs in January.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected Period 42: Demand reached 129 units (+100% vs November average), likely driven by seasonal sales events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are in the peak holiday shopping season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 129 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday), then dropped to 43 in Period 43. Historically, maternity leggings see sustained demand through December due to gift-giving and seasonal apparel needs. The 'In-transit' total of 291 units includes orders from Period 40 (47 units), Period 41 (83 units), Period 42 (48 units), and Period 43 (113 units). Note that the order from Period 38 (size 0) has 'concluded' by the absence of arrival in Period 42's conclude message, whereas the Period 39 order (6 units) arrived in Period 43 as expected (L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the proximity to the end of the year (Period 47), I will use an explicit forecast that accounts for the holiday variance. I expect demand to stay elevated above the autumn plateau (65 units) but below the extreme Black Friday peak. I'll set a weekly forecast of 85 units for the next 5 periods (L+1), resulting in mu_hat = 425.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonality confirmed: Significant demand spike in P42 (129 units) followed by stabilization. Estimating holiday baseline at ~85 units/week for December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing holiday-driven demand for maternity leggings. The demand history shows a massive spike in P42 (129 units) followed by a stabilization in P43-P44 (avg 48.5). Given the proximity to Christmas and typical retail cycles, I expect elevated demand for the next two periods. Period 44 conclude shows P40 order arrived with lead_time=4. However, P38 (ordered 0) and P42 (ordered 48) created/will create arrival gaps. The P41 order (83 units) is expected to arrive in Period 45's resolution phase. On-hand is low (10 units), and the pipeline (369 units) must bridge the gap through the end of the year. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 425 units (equivalent to 85 units/period for the 5-period horizon of L+1) to ensure the OR backend maintains a high base stock for the holiday remainder. Sigma remains based on recent volatility (N=6 to capture the post-November spike). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the year (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that we have passed the primary 'Autumn peak' (P30-P33) and the 'Holiday spike' (P42). Demand is now entering a post-holiday/end-of-year phase. In P42, demand was 129, but it has since dropped to 43, 54, and 47 in the last three periods. The average demand across P43-P45 is 48 units. However, we must account for potential 'January clearance' or a secondary winter dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit is high (423 units). The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the recent drop from the holiday peak, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current post-spike stabilization (~48 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Period 43-45 average demand is 48 units, significantly down from the P42 spike of 129, returning to the late-summer/pre-autumn baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We have emerged from the holiday season (P42 demand spike of 129 units) and observed a significant post-holiday cooling. Demand for the last four periods (P43-P46) has averaged 46.5 units (43, 54, 47, 42), which aligns with the late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (P42 order arrived in P46). Inventory levels are currently stable with 52 units on-hand and 375 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the December uncertainty). Given the transition into January, I anticipate demand will remain in this stabilized regime of ~45-50 units/period. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-holiday stabilization while ignoring the P42 spike. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.
