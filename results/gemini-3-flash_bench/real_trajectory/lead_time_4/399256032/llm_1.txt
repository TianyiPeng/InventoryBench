This suggests a seasonal ramp-up or a successful product launch phase. The date is 2019-02-11 (mid-February), heading towards spring, which often sees increased demand for fresh apparel and denim items. The last observed demand was 145. I will forecast demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the momentum, I expect demand to continue growing or stabilize at a higher level than the initial samples. Estimate average demand for the next 5 periods at ~160 units/period. Total expected demand for (L+1) = 800 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I must place an order to cover this entire window to avoid stockouts during the 4-period lead time.",

Historical demand shows a strong upward trend: Jan ranges (51, 64, 75, 99) to early Feb (145), and P1 (Feb 11) saw 113. This pattern aligns with the start of the Spring fashion season where demand for 'Everyday' denim typically rises. Current on-hand is 0, so P1 demand (113) was entirely lost. I have 800 units in-transit from P1. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, I expect the P1 order to arrive during P5 (visible P6). Therefore, I must cover demand for P2, P3, P4, and P5 before that shipment arrives. Forecast: Recent demand averages ~130/week. Total demand to cover (P2-P5) is roughly 130 * 4 = 520 units. However, I currently have 0 on-hand and the 800 units won't arrive until P5's arrival phase. I need to place an order now to cover the 'gap' after that arrival, bearing in mind this order will arrive in P6 (visible P7). To ensure I don't run out during the P5-P7 gap and to build safety stock for the 800-unit arrival, I will order enough to sustain the current trend.

As we move deeper into spring (late February/March), demand for 'ankle-length' and 'everyday collection' trousers typically increases due to seasonal transitions. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed: P1 (800), P2 (200). Current pipeline (in-transit) is 1000 units. My decision today (P3) will arrive in P7. Total pipeline must cover demand for P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7 (5 periods). Current demand mean appears to be ~125. 5 periods * 125 = 625 units. While 1000 units are in-transit, they will not arrive until P5 (P1 order) and P6 (P2 order) at the earliest. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we are losing sales until the P1 shipment arrives. Since the current pipeline (1000) already exceeds the 5-period expected demand (approx 625-750 including a safety buffer for the trend), and holding costs ($1) are equal to unit profit ($1), overstocking is as penalizing as understocking. I will place a small order to account for the sustained upward trend and potential lead time variability, but I must be cautious not to create excessive holding cost once the large P1 shipment (800) arrives.",

Historical demand shows a peak in early February (145), followed by a decline to 67 in the most recent period. However, the first four periods suffered from stockouts (sold=0), making the 'demand' figures potentially less reliable than the actual consumption once stock arrived.

Since the game started (Period 1-6), demand has averaged approximately 97.8 units per period (113, 124, 94, 94, 67, 95).

Our current pipeline (888) is significantly higher than the 500 needed to cover the lead time. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0), overstocking is very detrimental to total reward. Starting Period 7, we have 838 units, which should last over 8 weeks.

Current date is Sep 2nd, the start of the 'Back-to-School' and transition into Autumn season. Historical data and recent trends show demand was low (~25-35 units) during July/August, but is beginning to trend upward. In Period 29, an order of 80 was placed to anticipate this seasonal recovery. Currently, On-hand (152) + In-transit (80) = 232 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, these 232 units must cover demand for Periods 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34. Based on the transition into Autumn, I expect demand to rise toward the 50-70 units/week range seen in Spring. Averaging a forecasted demand of 50 units/period over the next 5 periods results in a requirement of ~250 units. My current pipeline is 232 units. I will order 50 units this period to continue building up stock as the 'Back-to-School' demand materializes and to maintain a safety buffer against the rising demand trend.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is a women's everyday denim product. Historical data and current period history show a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in early Spring (Feb-May ~85/week), a moderate summer slump, a slight recovery in Autumn (Sept-Oct ~30/week), and a sharp decline as winter approaches. Current demand (P41-P44) has dropped to single digits (4, 9, 9, 8), averaging ~7.5 units/week. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47) and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive before the game ends. Furthermore, the current on-hand inventory (107 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining expected demand (~25-30 units total) for the last 3 periods. In fact, the SKU is heavily oversupplied, and high holding costs ($1/unit/period) make inventory reduction the priority to protect profit.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Winter demand trough confirmed: December demand has stabilized at ~8 units/week (P43-P44), consistent with the single-digit regime established in P41. Inventory levels remain significantly higher than remaining lifetime demand.",

{
  "rationale": "The product 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (trousers/jeans) is currently in a deep winter demand trough, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 8.2 units over the last five periods (P41-P45: 4, 9, 9, 8, 11). This is Period 46 of 47, meaning only two periods of demand remain. The current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which is over 10 times the expected demand for the remaining periods. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), any unsold unit held until the end of the game will completely negate the profit from a sold unit. My primary objective is to stop all incoming stock and liquidate the existing surplus to minimize further holding costs. No orders are necessary or beneficial at this stage.",

  "rationale": "The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans, a garment for the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Based on the current date (Dec 30, 2019), we are at the end of the year. Historically, this SKU has transitioned from a high-demand spring period (~85 units/week) to a summer low (~25 units/week), fixed slightly during the autumn back-to-school season (~30 units/week), and has now collapsed into a winter trough. The last 6 periods show extremely low demand (P41-P46: 4, 9, 9, 8, 11, 3), averaging approximately 7.3 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 93 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, my safety stock and pipeline needs are negligible compared to the existing 93 units, which represent over 12 weeks of coverage at the current burn rate. Ordering now would only increase holding costs unnecessarily as we enter the first week of January. No new order is required.",
