Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial setup for 'Ladies Denim Skinny Ankle Jeans'. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (41 -> 137) over 5 weeks. Given the product type (basic fashion) and the late-January/early-February timing, we are likely seeing a post-winter or early-spring transition. The most recent demand (137) is over 3x the initial sample, indicating a strong positive regime shift. For this first period, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the upward momentum (avg \u2248 96/week) rather than the grand mean (avg \u2248 73/week). Promised lead time is 4, which implies a coverage window of 5 periods (L+1). L is set to default as we have no delivery history yet. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0) by default, but the cap should prevent over-ordering.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (Ladies Denim), we see a strong upward demand trend: 41, 38, 65, 85, 137, and most recently 183 in Period 1. This reflects a clear seasonal ramp-up as we move out of winter into spring, typical for ankle-length denim. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (157 units) was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4. Per the arrival sequence, this order is expected during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). Demand is currently outstripping our initial expectations, and with a promised lead time of 4, our 'mu_hat' must cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg of 85, 137, 183 = 135/week) to calculate \u03bc_hat, and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand samples show a significant upward trend: 41, 38, 65, 85, 137, followed by reported demand in P1 (183) and P2 (197). This indicates a strong positive momentum, likely due to spring seasonality for ankle-length denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 373 units in transit (157 from P1, 216 from P2). The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in P1 with L=4 should arrive in P5 (visible in P6). Therefore, zero arrivals so far is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. To address the rapidly increasing demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (137, 183, 197), which averages ~172 per period. Setting L to default (4) ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of this heightened demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from double digits in Jan to 172+ in Feb (+100%+ increase), suggesting spring seasonality for ankle jeans.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/03/04). Inventory is currently 0, with 597 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (2019/02/11) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (next period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). We are currently in a high-demand regime for 'Skinny Ankle jeans' which shifted in early February (~186 avg demand vs ~50 in Jan). March typically maintains or increases this spring-seasonality demand. Since we have no on-hand stock and have lost sales for 3 weeks, we must maintain a robust base stock. I will use the recent mean (last 3 samples: 183, 197, 180) to set mu_hat. N=3 is used for recent_N to capture this specific high-demand window accurately.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is an ankle-length jean, which typically sees high demand in spring. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks: 41, 38, 65, 85, 137) and active game demand (P1-P4: 183, 197, 180, 210) confirm a high-demand regime averaging approximately 192 units/week over the last 4 periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Order P1 was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase. Since we are currently at the start of Period 5's decision phase, we have not yet seen any arrivals (on-hand is 0). We expect the first shipment (157 units) to arrive later this period. Pipeline inventory (799) plus current order must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~192) and 'explicit' L=4 to maintain stability while waiting for shipment confirmation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime from mid-Feb through early March, averaging 192 units/week (+100% vs Jan). First shipment from P1 (157 units) expected to arrive during P5 arrival resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with a lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units with 806 units in-transit. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 180 units/week (183, 197, 180, 210, 130), confirming the high-demand regime for spring identified in previous insights, though Period 5 saw a slight dip to 130. Given the lead time is L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~900 units). Total inventory (on-hand 27 + in-transit 806) is 833, suggesting we are slightly under-stocked relative to recent demand averages. Since lead time is now confirmed at 4 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time data. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples reflect the current spring regime (mean ~180), so I'll use recent_N with N=5. For volatility, I'll use default to leverage the full available sample history including the pre-period data to ensure we capture enough variance for the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) average is 180 units/week, maintaining the 100%+ increase over January levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is established in a high-demand spring regime. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to 6, the average demand is 182.6 units/week, significantly higher than the January values provided (approx. 73 avg). The lead time is now reliably confirmed at 4 periods, with orders from P1 and P2 arriving exactly at L=4. We currently have 47 units on hand and 657 in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on \u03bc\u0302 (demand over L+1 periods) and \u03c3\u0302. Because the demand has been stable in this new high regime for 6 weeks, I will use recent_N (N=6) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this sustained shift without dilution from the much lower January figures. This ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of demand visibility).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in March at ~183 units/week (6-period avg); Lead time consistency at 4 periods reaffirmed by Period 6 arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. I am observing a significant demand spike in the most recent period (317 units), which is 70%+ higher than the previous 6-week average of ~183. This aligns with April/Spring seasonality for 'Ankle-length jeans'. Despite a delivery of 224 units in Period 7, on-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand outpaced supply. The pipeline inventory (643 units) consists of orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time from Period 5 and 6 conclusions, the Period 4 order (202 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 8 arrival resolution phase. To address the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the upward momentum (avg of 196, 130, 317) which equals roughly 214 units/week, and increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (130 vs 317). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period timing is stable.

Carry-over insight: April seasonality spike detected: Period 7 demand (317) is ~70% higher than the Feb-March average (~183), signaling a new high-demand regime for Spring.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Spring regime for ankle jeans. Recent demand in Periods 7 and 8 (317, 273) shows a significant step up from the previous mean of ~183, with the average of the last two periods being 295 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Stockouts in Periods 7 and 8 (ending inventory 0) indicate that our previous base stock targets were too low for this seasonal surge. I am setting L to the prometed value of 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from the ~180 range to the ~300 range (avg of P5-P8 is approx 229, but the backend uses (1+L)*mean, providing a base stock calculated towards ~1,145 total units). For sigma_hat, I am using the standard deviation of these recent periods to account for the increased volatility seen in the transition from March to April.

Carry-over insight: April Spring surge confirmed: Average weekly demand for P7-P8 is 295 units, a ~60% increase over the Feb-Mar average of ~183 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P7: 317, P8: 273, P9: 193) confirms a high-demand regime for Spring ankle jeans, though P9 showed a temporary dip. In April, the average weekly demand is approximately 261 units, significantly higher than the February-March baseline of ~183 units. I am currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 on P9 conclude) with 0 on-hand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9). Given the high demand and the stockout situation, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand. I will estimate mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the April Spring surge, while using the standard calculation for lead time.

We are currently in a high-demand Spring regime for ankle-length jeans. Since Period 7 (late March), demand has averaged 254 units/week (P7: 317, P8: 273, P9: 193, P10: 236). Although Period 9 showed a temporary dip, the overall level remains significantly higher than the February average (~180). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and have lost sales for four consecutive periods due to orders placed earlier (P4-P6) being insufficient to meet this surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand Spring level (Avg ~254 * 5 = 1270) and use sigma_hat from the same period to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring high-demand regime sustained (P7-P10): Avg demand ~254 units/week, a ~40% increase over the Feb-Mar average (~183), despite minor fluctuations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand Spring regime (April avg ~254 units/week). Despite shipments arriving regularly with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, on-hand inventory remains 0 because demand (avg 250+) consistently exceeds the smaller orders placed 4-5 weeks ago (P5: 164, P6: 67, P7: 210). We are currently experiencing stockouts. The current period (April 29) is at the tail end of the Spring peak for 'Ankle jeans'. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 7-11) to capture the current high-demand mean of ~251 units/week (total 1255 for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' for N=5 to account for the current volatility in this high-demand state. This should command the OR backend to place larger orders to recover inventory levels and meet current demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and we are entering the peak season for ankle jeans. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on all history (P1-P8 orders). Demand has stabilized at a higher 'Spring regime'. Looking at the last 3 periods (P10-P12), demand was 236, 236, and 250, averaging ~241 units/week. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend targets the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set L to 4 (default) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1205 (241 units/week * 5 periods) to ensure we maintain enough inventory to cover this sustained Spring demand without over-ordering as we approach the end of the season. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to account for the consistent volume seen in late April/early May.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: Weekly demand has stabilized around 240 units (+28% vs Mar avg of 187, slightly higher than Apr avg of 235). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-102.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/05/13). The product is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', which typically sees strong demand throughout the spring. Reviewing the history, demand spiked in late March/April (averaging ~250+) and has slightly moderated in the last few weeks (P11-13 average is ~220). The most recent demand was 176, but this follows a period of stockouts which may have impacted demand patterns or reporting. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P9 arrived in P13). To calculate mu_hat, I am using a recent window of 7 periods (P7-P13) to capture the elevated Spring demand regime (average ~240/week), while avoiding the lower Jan/Feb data. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially (L+1) * mean demand. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 1200 units). Current inventory (On-hand: 278 + In-transit: 751 = 1029) is slightly below this, so the OR backend will place a replenishment order to reach the target.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), the item 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is in its late Spring/Early Summer phase. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals from P1-P10). Demand in May has stabilized around 210-240 units per week (P12: 250, P13: 176, P14: 236). Calculating the mean for the May regime (last 3 periods) yields approximately 220 units/week. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50th percentile service level (z*=0), meaning the base stock goal is simply expected demand over (L+1) periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3-period average captures the current stabilization better than the April peak.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime stabilized: Average demand for periods 12-14 is approx 221 units/week, down from the April peak of 250+ units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in the late spring/early summer season for these ladies' ankle-length skinny jeans. Demand has remained relatively stable but high since the April peak. The most recent demand (Period 15) saw a spike to 288 units, bringing the average of the last 4 periods (P12-P15) to approximately 237.5 units/week. This aligns with the stabilized 'May regime' mentioned in carry-over insights (~221-240 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 11 order in Period 15. The system currently sits with 114 units on-hand and 702 in-transit. Given the high volatility (recent range 176 - 288), I am using a recent 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the slight mid-May dip back toward higher late-May levels, and setting sigma_hat to the default (all available samples) to ensure a robust safety buffer against the high variance observed throughout the season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3rd (Period 17), the SKU 399256005 (Ankle Jeans) is entering the summer season. Recent demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial spring months, with the last 3 periods (P14-P16) averaging 269 units/week (236, 288, 284). This is a noticeable increase from the late-May average previously noted. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 12 order in Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), but there is a large pipeline (880 units). Given the high demand and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend base stock logic will target approximately the 50th percentile of total demand across (L+1) periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (avg ~245), and 'calculate' for Lead Time since it has been highly reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: June weekly demand has transitioned to a higher plateau of ~270 units/week (P14-P16 avg), up from the May avg of ~221.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 (Ladies Denim Ankle Jeans) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime in June, as noted in Period 17's carry-over insight. The demand for Period 17 was 279 units, and the preceding three-period average (P14-P16) was approximately 270 units. This is a clear step up from the May average (~221 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after failing to meet full demand in Period 17. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17). To maximize reward, I must ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of this elevated June demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest demand plateau (P14-P17: [236, 288, 284, 279], Mean=271.75). This will push the mu_hat to approximately 1358 (5 * 271.75), allowing the capped policy to replenish inventory levels against the current 1002 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P14-P17 is 271.75 units/week, representing a significant increase over the May average of ~221 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in a high-demand June regime (P14-P18 demand: 236, 288, 284, 279, 257), averaging 268.8 units/week. This is a significant increase from the May average (approx 220 units/week). Despite the high demand, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P17 and P18, where demand (279, 257) exceeded the arriving shipments (200, 172). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived P18). For Period 19, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture this sustained June plateau (~269 units/week * 5 periods). Since demand volatility has slightly increased with higher volumes, sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and well-documented. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-demand regime across the lead-time horizon (L+1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Ladies' Ankle Jeans) is in a high-demand June regime. Recent demand values for Period 16-19 are 284, 279, 257, and 247, respectively, resulting in a 4-period average of 266.75 units/week. This demonstrates a shift from the May average of approx 221. An inventory stockout (on-hand = 0) has occurred for the last three periods (P17-P19) because historical orders during April/May were insufficient for this June surge. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods throughout the history (P15 order arrived at P19). To catch up with the current demand regime and account for the 4-period lead time (L) plus the decision period (1), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of demand (N=4) to reflect the June average of ~267 units/week. This will ensure base stock calculation (\u03bc * (1+L)) targets approximately 1335 units, covering the stockout and the pipeline. Lead time 'calculate' method is used as it accurately reflects the stable 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime sustained (P16-P19): Avg demand ~267 units/week, transitioning from May avg of ~221 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering July. Historically, June demand for SKU 399256005 (ankle jeans) was high, averaging approximately 242 units/week over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). Period 20 saw a slight dip to 189 units, but the broader 10-period average (P11-P20) is 236 units, suggesting demand remains robust. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the P16 order arriving in P20. With on-hand inventory at 180 and in-transit at 965 (totaling 1,145 units), the current pipeline is nearly sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (5 * 240 = 1,200). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the sustained Spring/Summer trend while damping the specific Period 20 dip, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. L is kept at default (4).

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: June demand averaged ~242 units/week (P16-P20), maintaining the high-demand regime established in late Spring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256005 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) shows a stable but high-demand regime established since late spring. The most recent five periods (P17-P21) have seen demands of 279, 257, 247, 189, and 212, averaging approximately 237 units per week. While June (P17-P20) averaged ~243, the late June and early July figures (P20-P21) suggest a slight softening but still significantly higher than the early year average. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). I will set L to 'calculate' to utilize observed lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime as we navigate through the July summer sales period, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high-turnover denim while accounting for the recent slight decline from the June peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: Demand has stabilized at ~237 units/week (P17-P21 avg), a slight cooling from the June average of ~243 but maintaining the high-volume Spring/Summer regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the SKU (skinny ankle jeans) is in a stable summer demand regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has averaged 198.4 units, showing a slight cooling compared to the high-spring peak but remaining relatively steady throughout July. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated by the P18 order arriving in P22). On-hand inventory is healthy at 415 units, with a steady pipeline (In-transit: 582). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (median demand). I will use a conservative recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current July stabilization while maintaining the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: July demand stabilized: Average weekly demand for P18-P22 has dropped to ~198 units, representing a stabilization below the June peak (~242) but remaining consistent for mid-summer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-245.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 (Ladies Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable mid-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P19-P23) shows demands of 247, 189, 212, 187, and 186, resulting in an average of 204.2 units/week. This represents a cooling from the June peak (~242) and aligns with the late-July seasonal context where summer fashion starts to stabilize before late-summer clearances or fall transitions. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history (P1 to P19 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). Inventory is currently healthy with 431 on-hand and 475 in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critically optimal service level 'q' is 0.5 (50%), meaning we aim to meet the median demand to minimize total costs. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower July plateau, and use a similar window for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering late July/early August. Reviewing recent demand, there is a clear downward trend: Period 20 (189), Period 21 (212), Period 22 (187), Period 23 (186), and Period 24 (124). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 180 units/week, significantly lower than the June peak of ~240+. Current on-hand inventory is high (436 units) due to recent arrivals exceeding the cooling demand. With an in-transit pipeline of 461 units and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the next 5 periods of demand (estimated at 180 * 5 = 900 units vs. 436 + 461 = 897 total inventory). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this cooling 'Late Summer' trend and prevent over-ordering, while keeping L at calculate (confirmed at 4) and sigma_hat at default to account for the recent volatility in the demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand cooling: Average demand has dropped to ~180 units/week (P20-P24), down from June's ~240 units/week plateau.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand data and recent conclusions show a cooling trend following the spring/summer peak. Specifically, the last three periods (P23-P25) show demand levels of 186, 124, and 139, averaging approximately 150 units/week. This is a significant drop from the June peak of ~240 units/week. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. With 373 units on-hand and 386 in-transit (total pipeline of 759), we are currently overstocked relative to the new lower demand regime (759 units covers ~5 periods of demand at the current rate). I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method as it has been consistent. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this late-summer downward shift (averaging the last 5 periods: 187, 186, 124, 139, and the P25 demand). This will lower the base stock target and allow inventory to bleed down, reducing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current trend.

Carry-over insight: August demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for P21-P25 is ~170 units/week, with the most recent three weeks (P23-P25) dropping further to ~150 units/week, down from the June plateau of ~240.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-250.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which has shown a clear cooling trend as the peak spring/summer season transitions into late summer (August). Recent demand for the last five periods (P22-P26) has averaged ~157 units/week (187, 186, 124, 139, 149), a significant step down from the June average of ~240 units. The last three periods specifically average ~137 units. To prevent overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks of data) to capture the current lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history, so I will continue using the default/calculate method for L. The current on-hand inventory (399) plus in-transit (300) is sufficient for nearly 4.5 weeks of demand at the current rate (699 total units / 157 avg demand \u2248 4.45 weeks), meaning the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order this period to normalize inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-August demand cooling: 5-week average demand (P22-P26) has dropped to 157 units/week, a ~35% decrease from the June peak (~240 units), indicating the end of the primary summer sales peak for ankle jeans.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (late August), the demand for skinny ankle jeans continues its seasonal decline. The demand in Period 27 was 94 units, maintaining a downward trend from the early August levels (~150). The average demand over the last four weeks (P24-P27) is 126.5 units, which is significantly lower than the July average (~190). On-hand inventory is currently high at 400 units, while lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P17 through P23). Given the decreasing demand and sufficient stock, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the cooling trend, which effectively reduces the order volume to prevent excessive holding costs as the season wind down. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand cooldown: Late August demand (Period 27) dropped to 94 units, confirming a sustained decline from the mid-summer average of 198 units to a new baseline of ~125-130 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-177.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/8/26), and demand for ankle jeans is clearly in a downward seasonal trend as the transition to autumn begins. The most recent demand samples are 124, 139, 149, 94, and 169 (average 135 units/week), a significant decrease from the peak summer average of ~240. Period 27's demand (94) was notably low, while Period 28 saw a slight rebound (169). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend (average ~135) without overreacting to the single lowest point. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With 346 units on hand and 176 in transit (total 522), our inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4 weeks of the current reduced demand regime, so the OR backend will likely minimize or zero out the current order to avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand cooldown (Period 24-28): Weekly demand has stabilized at a lower baseline of approx 135 units/week, down from the June/July high-volume regime (~200+).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019), we are observing a significant seasonal decline for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' as summer transitions into fall. Historical demand in the most recent five periods (P25-P29: 139, 149, 94, 169, 87) averages roughly 128 units/week. This is a sharp drop from the June/July plateau of ~200-240 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 87 units, signaling potential further downward pressure as ankle-length jeans lose seasonal relevance in autumn. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (P25 order arrived in P29). Inventory levels are currently high (OH: 260, IT: 328, Total: 588) relative to this new lower demand baseline. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent cooldown, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the heightened volatility during this transition (e.g., the jump from 94 to 169 back to 87).

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau: Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline of ~128 units/week (P25-P29) as the peak spring/summer season for ankle jeans concludes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained post-summer demand cooldown as we enter September. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P25-P30: 139, 149, 94, 169, 87, 95) shows an average demand of approximately 122 units per week, which is a significant drop from the spring/summer peak of ~240. The current date is 2019/9/9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 30. Pipeline inventory (289) and on-hand inventory (254) are sufficient to cover the current demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods * ~122 = 610 units required; currently have 543 units). I will use the recent 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower demand profile, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on historical summer peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a post-summer cooldown phase. Recent demand (P27-P31: 94, 169, 87, 95, 76) shows a clear shift to a lower plateau. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 104 units per week, which is a significant drop from the 200+ units seen during the spring/summer peak. We are now in mid-September, and ankle jeans typically see reduced demand as colder weather approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Inventory levels are healthy (On-hand: 264, In-transit: 271), so we focus on setting parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'low' regime while ignoring the older high-volume summer data.

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline of ~104 units/week (P27-P31) as the peak spring/summer season concludes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in a confirmed late-season cooldown as we enter late September. Demand has stabilized at a lower plateau; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 100 units/week (169, 87, 95, 76, 74). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 190 units on-hand and 271 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 461), we are overstocked relative to the current demand regime. Specifically, at ~100 units/week, the OR backend's target base stock (L+1 * demand) would be around 500 units. Since current pipeline (461) is close to this target and demand is trending downward, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent 5-week average to prevent excessive inventory accumulation during the off-season. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 5 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand cooldown sustained: 5-week average demand (P28-P32) has stabilized at ~100 units/week, a ~60% reduction from the June peak, matching end-of-season expectations for ankle jeans.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a late-season cooldown phase as we move into October. The demand has stabilized at a lower baseline, consistent with the end of the primary spring/summer sales cycle. In Period 33, demand was 87 units, and the 5-week average (P29-P33) is approximately 84 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P29 order arriving in P33 as expected. My current on-hand inventory is 256 units with 158 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, and P33). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0 (50% service level target), and the clear downward stabilization, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current ~84 units/week regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this lower demand while avoiding excessive holding costs as the season concludes.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand plateau: Weekly demand has stabilized at approximately 84 units (P29-P33 average), reflecting the post-summer seasonal baseline for ankle jeans.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256005 (ankle jeans) is in a clear seasonal 'cooldown' phase as we enter October. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 79.4 units/week, consistent with the end-of-season plateau identified in previous insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 arrived in P33, P30 arrived in P34). Currently, on-hand inventory (241) and in-transit units (113) total 354 units. With (L+1)=5 periods of protection needed and a current demand rate of ~80 units, the system needs approximately 400 units of stock. My current pipeline (354) is slightly below this, but given the inventory holding cost equals profit ($1.0), and demand is trending downward (last week was 65), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this lower baseline without over-ordering. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a lean stock level suitable for the end of the product's primary seasonal cycle.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal baseline confirmed: Weekly demand for ankle jeans has settled into a 65-85 unit range (P30-P34 average 79), marking the final stage of the post-summer cooldown.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256005 (ankle-length skinny jeans) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-October. The most recent demand (Period 35) was 44 units, and the 5-period average (P31-P35) has dropped to approximately 69 units/week, down from the 80+ range observed in September. On-hand inventory is currently high (265 units), which covers nearly 4 weeks of current demand levels. There are also 88 units in-transit (ordered in P33-P35) arriving over the next 4 periods. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock (mu_hat) should align closely with the expected demand over the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5). Setting mu_hat to approximately 350-375 (70-75 units/week across 5 periods) will prevent excessive overstocking during this cooldown while maintaining availability. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest leg of the decline.

Carry-over insight: October demand cooling confirmed: 5-week average (P31-P35) is ~69 units/week, down from ~84 in September and ~100 in August.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. Demand for ankle jeans has entered a late-season cooling phase. The 5-week average demand (P32-P36) is approximately 61.8 units/week, significantly lower than the September baseline. The most recent demand (P36) was 39 units. On-hand inventory is 226 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current average, or over 5 weeks at the most recent observed level. Pipeline inventory is 88 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while providing enough safety margin for the backend to consider current stock levels. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced volatility at lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: October late-season cooling confirmed: 5-week average demand (P32-P36) has dropped to ~62 units/week, with the most recent week at 39 units, indicating the end-of-year seasonal low for ankle jeans.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 38 (late October). Historical demand for these ankle jeans shows a clear downward seasonal trend as we head into winter. Recently, demand has dropped from a September baseline of ~100 to an October average (P34-P37) of ~50 units/week. P37 demand was 51 units. With 215 units on-hand and an additional 48 in-transit (from orders in P34 and P35), our total inventory of 263 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods of lead time and review, especially given the cooling trend. To avoid excessive holding costs on a seasonal item nearing its end-of-season low, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 (representing the last 5 weeks of Oct/late Sep) to capture this lower baseline of ~57 units per week. No additional orders are likely needed, and these parameters will signal the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 (ankle-length skinny jeans) is in a clear late-autumn seasonal decline. Looking at the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 55 units/week (65, 44, 39, 51, 76), showing significant volatility but a generally low baseline compared to the summer peak of ~240. Period 38 saw a slight uptick to 76, but this is likely a minor fluctuation rather than a trend reversal. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (144) plus in-transit stock (66) totals 210 units. Using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current late-season baseline (~275 total over the next 5 periods) while sigma_hat recent_N=5 accounts for the recent uptick's volatility. Given the 1/1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a product at the end of its seasonal lifecycle to minimize leftover stock and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P34-P38): Demand has stabilized at a late-season baseline of ~55 units/week, down ~80% from the June peak, with occasional volatility (e.g., P38 spike to 76).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late-autumn seasonal low for ankle jeans. Recent demand (P35-P39) has been 44, 39, 51, 76, and 47, averaging 51.4 units/week. While there was a slight spike in P38, the overall trend continues at a significantly lower baseline compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 140 units on hand and 88 in transit (from P38 and P39), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ weeks of demand at the current rate (~51 units/week). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the year, I will adjust mu_hat by using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime (~51 * 5 = 255 total demand for L+1).

Carry-over insight: November demand regime (P35-P39): Stable late-season baseline confirmed at ~51 units/week, down from September's ~84 units/week. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a late-autumn/early-winter demand regime for ankle jeans. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has averaged 57 units/week (39, 51, 76, 47, 72), reflecting a stable but volatile seasonal baseline. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P35 order arrived in P39). On-hand inventory is 68 units, with 117 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, and P40). To maintain availability against this mid-high double-digit demand while minimizing holding costs for this low-margin/high-holding-cost SKU (Profit=1, Holding=1), I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant late-season behavior.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 (Ankle Jeans) is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a lower plateau compared to the spring/summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 58.8 units/week. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple historical arrivals (e.g., Period 39 arrival from Period 35 order). On-hand inventory is currently low (20 units), while in-transit inventory is high (201 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 50%, making it critical to avoid overstocking during this low-demand season. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable late-season baseline while ignoring the much higher historical summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand baseline confirmed (P37-P41): Average weekly demand has stabilized at ~59 units/week, down significantly from the summer peak (~240 units) and the September cooldown (~100 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a significant demand spike (169 units), which is likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event (Date: 2019/11/25). This depleted all on-hand inventory. The current on-hand is 0, with 251 units in-transit. The 251 units in-transit consist of orders from P39 (65), P40 (29), P41 (84), and P42 (73). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P39 order (65 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P43) resolution. While the P42 spike was high, historical data from December 2018 (available in the initial samples: 2019-01-07 was 41, but prior weeks in late Dec are usually lower for this SKU type) and the general 'ankle jeans' seasonality suggest demand will normalize or remain at a moderate late-season level after the holiday peak. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the recent average (~82 units/week) which includes the spike, providing a safety buffer without over-ordering for the end of the year. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand jumped to 169 units (likely Black Friday), up from the ~59 units/week baseline observed in November.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans experienced a significant holiday spike in Period 42 (169 units, likely Black Friday), followed by a return to more moderate levels in Period 43 (56 units). We are now entering the December holiday gifting season. Historically, this product shows high volatility in demand clusters. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units). With a consistent 4-period lead time, we must account for sustained holiday demand and the late-December/January transition. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand period (averaging ~80 units/week) while setting an explicit higher sigma_hat to protect against further holiday volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected in Period 42 (169 units), with demand returning to a higher-than-baseline level (~56 units) in Period 43, suggesting a December plateau higher than the November average (~59 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (Period 45). Demand patterns show a clear transition from the late-autumn baseline (~51-59 units) to a volatile holiday regime. Period 42 saw a massive spike (169 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, while Periods 43 and 44 settled at 56 and 40 units respectively. However, with the Christmas/New Year period approaching, demand for 'skinny ankle jeans' may see a secondary holiday spike or post-holiday clearance activity. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent volatility and the risk of being out-of-stock during the festive season, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (including the spike) to ensure we maintain enough inventory to cover potential demand surges. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the 169 spike in the moving average, providing a conservative safety buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance seen in the late-year data.

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility: P42-P44 suggests a holiday regime with high variance (spike of 169), shifting from the stable November baseline (~55).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46). Previous periods (P42-P44) showed high demand volatility due to holiday shopping (Black Friday spike of 169 units in P42). In Period 45, demand returned to a lower level of 29 units. Historically, January demand (from initial samples) was around 40-85 units before the Spring surge. With current on-hand inventory at 55 and 301 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45), we have a significant pipeline covering the lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we've passed the December peak and are heading into the lower-demand January baseline, I will set mu_hat to capture the recent holiday variance while trending back toward a baseline mean. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to account for the holiday period (P41-P45 avg ~68) and sigma_hat to capture the resulting volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand in Period 45 (29 units) suggests a return to lower seasonal levels (40-60 range) following the early December volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand shows we have passed the early December holiday peak (Period 42 spike of 169 units). The most recent two weeks (Periods 45 and 46) show demand of 29 and 16 units respectively, indicating a sharp post-holiday cooldown and likely end-of-year inventory clearance or winter seasonal low. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 62 units, but skewed by the holiday peak; excluding that, the trend is significantly lower (approx 30-40 units). On-hand inventory is 112 units with 228 units in-transit (orders from P43-P45). Given the current on-hand covers several weeks of the new low-demand regime and lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the downward trend while accounting for recent volatility, and use 'calculate' for lead time as it remains consistent at 4 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse: Year-end demand (P45-P46) has dropped to <30 units/week, significantly lower than the November/December average (~60-70).
