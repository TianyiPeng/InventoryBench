Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 610776022 (Women's T-shirt). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from 53 (Jan 7) to 233 (Feb 4), suggesting a ramp-up in demand as we approach the spring season. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to ensure our base stock covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the strong growth trend (nearly 4.5x over 5 weeks), the mean of all samples will underestimate current needs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~232) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use the 'default' method for L as there is no historical lead time data yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a basic apparel item. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 11 shows a clear upward trend: 53, 132, 222, 242, 233, and most recently 267 (Period 1). This suggests a demand ramp-up as we move towards spring. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (249 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). There was a stockout in Period 1 (demand 267, sold 0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand levels (avg ~247 per week) while accounting for the growth. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (4 periods) as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to prove otherwise. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, a wardrobe basic. Current demand (P1: 267, P2: 354) is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~176). The demand is ramping up, likely due to spring seasonality entering late February. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (526 units). Promised lead time is 4. Since we are only at P3, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order expected in P5). Given the clear upward trend in demand over the last 5 samples and recent game history, I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting. For mu_hat, I'll use N=4 to capture the recent growth (222, 242, 233, 267, 354). L is kept at default as we have no evidence yet to suggest actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 610776022 is a basic T-shirt. Current date is early March. Historical data shows demand increasing from low 50s/130s in early January to stable levels around 230-350 in February. The last five weeks of demand (including the game starts) are 233, 267, 354, 277. I'll use a recent window of N=4 to capture this current regime (avg ~283). Promised lead time L=4 means orders from Period 1 (conducted at start of P1) should arrive in Period 5 (visible at start of P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 891 in-transit (P1-P3 orders). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Since 5 * 283 = 1415, and we only have 891 units, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I'm using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-January stabilized demand level.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which is likely entering peak demand as we approach spring (March 11). Historical demand samples show a significant increase from January (avg ~145) to February/early March (avg ~266). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this higher February demand regime. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (ordered=249) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (making them visible in Period 6's conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have reached the 4-period lead time yet. Total in-transit is 1258 (249+277+365+367), which aligns with the pipeline created over the last 4 periods. Since no arrivals have concluded yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am focusing on the last 4 periods where demand stabilized at a higher level (267, 354, 277, 166) compared to January.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand history shows an initial climb (up to 354 in P2) followed by a decline as we enter March (166-170 in P4-P5). Looking at early 2019 data provided, demand was also rising from Jan to Feb. The current demand regime (last 2 periods) is significantly lower than the Feb peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, there is a large pipeline (1081 units) from orders in P2, P3, P4, and P5. With on-hand at 79 and demand recently averaging around 170, the large pipeline (approx 270-360 units per period arriving soon) will likely lead to high inventory. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend (N=2 for current regime) to avoid over-ordering, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand regime shifted lower starting Period 4 (avg ~168 vs previous avg ~300).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/03/25. Looking at the history, the product is a women's lightweight basic T-shirt. The actual lead time has been confirmed twice as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand history shows initial high values (Avg ~300 in P1-P3) followed by a dip (Avg ~168 in P4-P5), but Period 6 saw a sudden spike back to 310. Given the date (late March), we are entering Spring, suggesting demand for lightweight T-shirts may be stabilizing at a higher level than the early March dip. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). Pipeline inventory is 804 (Orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), and ending inventory is 46. The P3 order (365 units) is expected to arrive during Period 7. To capture the recent volatility and the Spring trend, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=3) to balance the low P4/P5 periods with the high P6 spike, setting the lead time explicitly to 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in March; Period 6 saw a return to high demand (310) after two lower periods (~168). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 610776022 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is entering the spring season. Historical demand shows significant volatility: an early high (avg ~280), a dip in early March (avg ~168), and a recent resurgence in late March (avg ~283 over the last two weeks). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Given the products are 'Everyday Basics' and the current date is April 1st, demand is expected to remain firm or increase with warmer weather. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent bounce-back in demand while acknowledging the March variance. Pipeline inventory (666) plus on-hand (155) is 821. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~225 units/period, we need ~1125 units in the system. The OR engine will use these parameters to bridge the current gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Late March (P6-P7) averaged 283 units, rebounding from the early March lull (avg 168). Spring seasonality appears to be driving a return to higher baseline demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-114.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is entering the spring/summer peak. History shows a lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The demand has shifted from a lull in early March (avg 168) back to a higher level in late March/early April. The last three periods (P6, P7, P8) had demands of 310, 256, and 204 respectively (average ~257). Given the spring seasonality of a jersey T-shirt, I anticipate demand will remain at this higher level or increase. Current inventory position: On-hand = 318, In-transit = 606 (Orders from P5, P7, P8). Orders placed in P5 (72 units) should arrive this period (P9). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent demand recovery, while keeping lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. Since holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level base stock; however, the cap will ensure we don't over-order during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Late March/Early April demand (P6-P8) suggests a baseline around 250-260 units, significantly higher than the early March slump.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees steady or increasing demand throughout spring. Historical demand has been volatile: an early March slump (avg ~168) followed by a rebound in late March (avg ~283). However, the last two periods (P8 and P9) have shown a cooling trend with demand at 204 and 173 units respectively. This suggests the 'stabilization' around 260 units previously noted might have been premature, and demand is currently oscillating between 170 and 210. I will prioritize the last four periods (P6-P9) to capture this post-slump variability, which averages 235 units. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With 217 on-hand and 878 in-transit (covering orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu and sigma to acknowledge the recent volatility while centering on the current spring level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is a seasonal spring/summer item. Historical demand analysis: Early Feb (P1-P3) saw high demand (~300), followed by a March lull (~168 in P4-P5), then a recovery in late March/early April (averaging ~230). Period 10 demand was 206. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P9) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, Period 10 conclude showed 0 arrivals (the order from P6 was expected if LT=4). This suggests a potential 1-period delay or a lost shipment, though P6 had an order of 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 10. Thus, lead time remains stable at 4. For demand Mu, I will use recent_N=5 (P6-P10) to capture the current post-lull stabilization around 230 units/period. Sigma will use a longer window (recent_N=10) to capture the wider historical volatility of this seasonal product.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are seeing sustained demand for high-frequency women's basics (T-shirts) as spring transitions into summer. Historical demand analysis shows the following: Period 6-11 demand averages 240 units, compared to the earlier slump. Period 11 demand spiked to 291 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P7 arrived in P11). Note that the order from P6 (ordered=0) explains why no arrival was recorded in P10. For Period 12, we expect the order from Period 8 (307 units) to arrive, which will replenish the current 0 on-hand inventory. Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods and a demand regime that has stabilized around 240-250 units with occasional spikes over 290, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this slightly higher spring/summer baseline and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in April. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period pipeline (L+1) while maintaining a high service level for this high-velocity basic item.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: April demand (P9-P11) averaged 223 units but showed a significant spike (291) in late April, leading to a stockout. Seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics' is trending upward moving into May.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/05/06), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical data shows two distinct regimes: a spring slump in early March (avg ~168) followed by a persistent recovery starting in late March. The last 4 periods (P9-P12) show demand of 173, 206, 291, and 278, averaging ~237. The recent spike in P11-P12 (avg 284) suggests upward seasonality moving into May. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 29 units on hand and 893 in transit (including P9's 344 units expected to arrive this period), we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand baseline of ~237, which balances the April average with the recent end-of-month surge to ensure we cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit margin, necessitating a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: May seasonality confirmed: Demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts is trending upward, with P11-P12 averaging 284 units compared to the early April average of 190.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt for women, which is entering peak summer seasonality. Demand history shows significant volatility: Period 13 saw a drop to 168 units, contrasted with late April/early May levels averaging around 280 units (P11-P12). Looking at the historical samples and recent performance, we are in a high-demand regime with high variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline (In-transit: 812) plus on-hand (205) totals 1017 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected mean demand of ~260-280 units during peak season, we need approximately 1300-1400 units in the system to avoid stockouts. To capture the recent trend including the stockout in P11 and the high volatility of spring/summer t-shirt sales, I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean and sigma to capture the volatile late-April to mid-May window (averaging ~224 with high variance).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), we are in a high-demand season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (lightweight jersey T-shirts). Although demand in the last two periods (P13: 168, P14: 161) was lower than the late April peaks (P11: 291, P12: 278), the overall trend for late spring/early summer suggests maintaining a robust baseline. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P10). I am selecting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P10-P14) to capture the blend of peak demand and the recent slight dip, resulting in a mean demand of approximately 220 per period. With L=4, this translates to a mu_hat of ~1100 (5 periods of demand). sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility. The on-hand inventory is 128 and in-transit is 827, totaling 955. The OR backend will use these parameters to order enough to reach the base stock level required for the 4-period lead time plus the review period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 27th (Period 16). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand in May (Periods 13-15) has averaged ~190 units (168, 161, 241), which is slightly lower than the April peak but shows a recent sharp increase to 241 units. This upward trend suggests late-spring/early-summer seasonality is becoming more relevant. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are identical, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend OR logic will target the median (50th percentile) of demand. To ensure we don't stock out during this seasonal transition, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent demand uptick. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the trend from roughly late April through May (Avg ~228 per period). This provides a balanced forecast for the (L+1)=5 periods of demand the order must cover. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to match the current volatility context.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in high demand during the summer months. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averages 217, but the broader May-June context shows demand levels consistently fluctuating between 160 and 240. The most recent signal (P15-P16) shows demand stabilizing around 240. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P12 order in P16. Pipeline inventory (787) plus on-hand (114) is currently 901, representing discovery for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent seasonal trend (avg 217 per period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration protects against the rising summer seasonality while acknowledging the pipeline is already substantial.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in high demand during the summer months. Recent demand (P15-P17) has averaged 227 units, while the broader late-spring/early-summer range (P11-P17) averages 226 units. However, looking at the same period in the provided sample data (late May/early June), demand was consistently above 220. Given the steady lead time of 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals in the history, including the P13 order arriving in P17), I will use the promised lead time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am choosing a recent_N of 7 to capture the core late-spring/early-summer demand levels (averaging ~226 units per period), which accounts for the seasonality observed in May and June. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current volatility (std dev ~43). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient coverage for the peak summer season while managing the holding costs, which equal the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality confirmed: June demand (P15-P17) is averaging 227 units, maintaining the higher baseline established in May. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-June). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a summer regime. Recent demand (last 4 periods: P15-P18) has been 241, 238, 203, 169, averaging 213 units. While Period 18 saw a dip to 169, the overall June average remains around 210-220. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). Current on-hand is 104, with 856 in-transit (P15-P18 orders). Pipeline inventory is healthy. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current June cooling from the May peak while maintaining sufficient stock for summer volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect recent variance. Lead time (L) remains at the default/promised 4 periods as evidence shows no drift.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent resolution of orders from P1-P15. Current on-hand inventory is 91 units with 811 units in transit. Demand for product 610776022 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has softened slightly in June (P18-P19 avg 165.5) compared to the late-May peak. However, given the product type and seasonality established in earlier carry-over insights, the general summer baseline is expected to hold. I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P15-P19) for mu_hat to capture the current June demand levels (~202 avg) while smoothing the most recent dips. I'll maintain recent_N for sigma_hat with a window of 10 to capture moderate volatility observed throughout the spring-summer transition. The OR backend with q=0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1) will target a base stock near the median (0.5 fractile) of the (L+1) demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: June demand (P15-P19) shows a slight cooling (avg 202) from the May peaks but remains higher than the early March lows. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand remains in a stable summer regime. Following the May peaks (avg ~284), June (P16-P20) recorded demands of 238, 203, 169, 162, and 152, averaging 184.8 units. This indicates a consistent but slight cooling trend for this specific 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt as we enter July. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently verified by the game history (e.g., P16 order arrived in P20). I am selecting N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent cooling trend in June while discarding the significantly higher May peaks. On-hand inventory (215) and In-transit stock (646) are currently healthy relative to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: June/July demand cooling: The late-June (P18-P20) demand averaged 161, down from the May/early-June baseline of ~227, suggesting a mid-summer stabilization at a lower level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear cooling trend since late June. The average demand for the last four periods (P18-P21) is approximately 156.5 units, compared to the May-June average of ~227. This aligns with mid-summer stabilization for a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey'. Recent demand readings are 169, 162, 152, and 143, indicating a steady downward drift or stabilization at a lower baseline. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across historical arrivals. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 50%, which means the OR engine will target the median demand (base_stock roughly equal to the expected demand over L+1 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower demand regime (avg ~156.5) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility to prevent over-ordering as we move further into July. Pipeline inventory (in-transit 524 + on-hand 257 = 781) is currently quite high relative to the ~156 demand, so no large orders are expected from the OR backend.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has shown a consistent downward trend as we move further into July. Over the last five periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 151 units, significantly lower than the May/June baseline of approximately 220-230 units. This cooling suggests the product is entering a mid-to-late summer stabilization phase or a seasonal lull. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 374 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand level. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current lower demand regime and minimize excess holding costs. The OR backend's inventory balancing will likely result in a very small or zero order this period to allow current stock to deplete.

Carry-over insight: July demand cooling confirmed: Demand from P18-P22 (mid-June to mid-July) has stabilized at a lower average of ~151 units, down ~33% from the May/early-June average of ~225.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a sustained summer cooling phase, as noted in the carry-over insights. Looking at the last 6 periods (P18-P23), the demand has trended down (169, 162, 152, 143, 129, 106). The mean demand over these 6 periods is approximately 143.5. Specifically, the last three periods (P21-P23) averaged 126 units, confirming a significant drop from the May/June baseline of ~225. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (372) plus pipeline (277) equals 649 units. With an current average demand of ~126-140, we have roughly 4-5 periods of coverage. I will set the mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this downward trend without over-reacting to a single week, and do the same for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will balance the high service level (profit=1, holding=1 -> q=0.5) against the cooling demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late July demand cooling intensified: P21-P23 average demand fell to 126 units, reflecting a ~45% decrease from the May baseline (~227).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently experiencing a sustained demand decline as we move into late July. The average demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) is approximately 102 units, compared to the previously observed May/June baseline of over 200 units. This cooling trend has been consistent for several weeks. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by the P20 order arriving in P24). Consequently, I am lowering the demand forecast (mu_hat) by using N=5 for recent demand, which captures the shift towards this lower seasonal baseline (~110 units/period). This will prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, as on-hand inventory (413) is currently high relative to current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand (P22-P24) has significantly cooled to an average of ~102 units, confirming a transition to a lower summer demand regime compared to the early summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-372.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has entered a significant late-summer cooling phase. The most recent demand samples (P23: 106, P24: 70, P25: 52) show a sharp decline compared to the June/July average. Current on-hand inventory is 424 units, with 172 units still in-transit (orders from P22-P24). Given the current demand (avg ~76 over the last 3 periods), we have approximately 5-6 weeks of stock already on hand, plus another 2+ weeks incoming. Since holding costs equal profit ($1.0), and we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (N=3) to prevent the OR engine from placing additional unnecessary orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand collapse confirmed: Period 23-25 demand averaged 76 units, a ~50% drop from the early July baseline (~151) and ~66% drop from May peaks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a significant late-summer slump. The average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is 52.3 units, compared to the early summer average of ~225. Period 26 specifically saw only 35 units of demand. Current on-hand inventory is 391 units, and there are 170 units in transit (ordered in P23 and P24). With a lead time of 4 periods, total inventory (561) is far in excess of the projected demand (approx 260 for L+1 periods) at the current regime. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this lower demand floor and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we clear the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand floor confirmed: Demand has dropped to an average of ~52 units (P24-P26), down nearly 80% from May peaks. Significant inventory surplus (561 units) exists relative to current demand levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 (mid-August). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a significant downward seasonal trend for SKU 610776022 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) as the summer ends. Demand has dropped from a May peak of ~284 units to a recent average of ~41 units over the last three periods (P25-P27: 52, 35, 38). With on-hand inventory at 454 units and 69 units in-transit (total pipeline of 523 units), our current inventory covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The objective is to minimize holding costs while demand remains in this low-regime floor. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect the current 'late-summer floor' regime, which will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while we burn through existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand baseline confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a floor of ~41 units (P25-P27), confirming the end of the summer peak and the transition to a low-volume fall/winter baseline for this item.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized at a significantly lower late-August floor, with the last 4 periods (P25-P28) averaging approximately 42 units (52, 35, 38, 43). The current stock on-hand is 480 units, while in-transit inventory is zero (all previous orders through P24 have arrived, and P25-P28 were zero orders). Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods. At a high estimate of 45-50 units per period, the required base stock would be ~250 units. Since on-hand inventory (480) is nearly double this requirement and significantly exceeds the sum of demand over the replenishment cycle, no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set using recent_N=4 to reflect this low-volume autumn baseline and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to historical high-demand summer averages.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has clearly entered a late-summer/early-fall low-volume regime. Demand over the last five periods (P25-P29) has been 52, 35, 38, 43, and 35 units, respectively, resulting in a mean of 40.6 units. The current on-hand inventory is 445 units with 0 units in transit. Given the current average demand, the existing stock covers approximately 11 periods (L+7), which is well beyond the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), maintaining excess inventory is highly detrimental to the total reward. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory, preventing any new orders from being placed while the existing surplus is gradually sold off. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor established: Demand from P25-P29 has centered at ~41 units, confirming a stable low-volume regime for the fall season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized at a low-volume fall baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged approximately 41 units (35, 38, 43, 35, 42). This represents a significant regime shift from the summer peak. The current on-hand inventory of 403 units is more than enough to cover the forecasted demand for the next several months, given the current weekly demand rate. Specifically, at ~41 units/week, 403 units provide roughly 10 weeks of safety, which is far beyond the 5-week (L+1) coverage window needed. No new orders have been placed since Period 24, which is appropriate given the surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent N=6 average (approx 41 * 5 = 205) and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility to prevent unnecessary replenishment while on-hand inventory is exhausted.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized into a low-volume fall regime. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has consistently hovered around a mean of 40 units (range 34-52), which is an 80% decrease from the summer peak. Currently, we have 369 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the current demand mean (~40) and lead time (4), the required pipeline inventory (base stock) is significantly lower than our current on-hand balance. To minimize holding costs while demand is at this floor, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using recent_N (N=7) to capture the stabilization since Period 25 and use default lead time and sigma calculations.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has entered a stable, low-volume regime for the fall season, consistent with late-summer cooling. Since Period 25 (late July/August), demand has consistently hovered between 33 and 52 units, with the most recent four periods (P29-P32) averaging approximately 36 units. The current on-hand inventory is 336 units, which at the current consumption rate provides over 9 periods of cover\u2014well beyond the 4-period lead time plus the review period. Consequently, no new orders are required. I will maintain L at the default (4) and set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (late July to mid-September) to capture the current low-demand baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using the recent 8 periods to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to reside in its late-summer/fall floor regime. Since Period 25, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 39 units per week (P25-P33 range: 33-52). Currently, on-hand inventory is 303 units with no units in transit. Given the current lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at a requirement to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~39 units, this requires a base stock of roughly 195 units. Since on-hand inventory (303) is significantly above this requirement, no new orders should be placed. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering the period since the demand floor was established) to ensure the OR engine recognizes this lower baseline and allows the inventory to bleed down naturally, avoiding further holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey Basic' has stabilized at a low-volume fall baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 38.5 units per period with very low volatility (standard deviation ~5.6). Current inventory on-hand is 269 units, which, at an average demand of ~39 units, provides approximately 7 periods of coverage. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we are currently in an overstock position. The goal is to allow on-hand inventory to bleed down towards the target base stock level before placing new orders. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this stable low-demand regime, and 'calculate' for lead time as it remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has settled into a consistent low-volume 'floor' regime typical for fall/winter, established since late August. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), demand has averaged 37.1 units per period, with recent demand (P31-P35) even lower at approximately 32 units. On-hand inventory is currently 244 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L) is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. At the current demand rate of ~37 units, total needs for the next 5 periods are roughly 185 units. Since on-hand inventory (244) already exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation aligns with this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized fall baseline and avoid influence from high summer demand. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand baseline confirmed: Demand from P31-P35 has further stabilized at approximately 32 units, slightly lower than the September average of 41.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is currently in a stable, low-volume demand regime. Since Period 31 (early September), demand has consistently hovered between 24 and 34 units, with a five-period average (P32-P36) of 29.8 units. The on-hand inventory of 220 units is significant, covering approximately 7 periods of current demand, which exceeds the review + lead time (1+4=5 periods). With a holding cost equal to the profit ($1.0), it is critical to keep inventory levels lean to avoid eroding total rewards. I will continue to use recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower baseline while setting L to 'calculate' based on the stable historical lead time of 4 periods. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current surplus.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a stable, low-volume demand regime typical for late October. Current demand (P31-P37) is averaging ~32 units per week. Inventory is extremely high at 182 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current average demand, the base stock targets should be around 160 units ((L+1) * 32). Since on-hand inventory (182) already exceeds this level, no new orders are necessary. I will continue to use recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized Autumn baseline (~32 units) and allow the system to bleed off the excess inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable low-volume fall/winter regime. Demand has settled at a very low level compared to its spring/summer peak. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P31-P38) show an average demand of approximately 30.25 units (range 17-38). We are entering November, where demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts is expected to remain at this baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 165 units, which is significantly more than the current demand requirements for the lead time (L=4) plus current period (5 periods total, ~151 units). Because on-hand inventory (165) exceeds current demand expectations (5 * ~30 = 150), and we have no in-transit units, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will correctly result in zero or minimal orders to reduce holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this specific low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Everyday T-shirt) is in a stable low-demand regime for the fall/winter season. The most recent demand (Period 39) was extremely low at 8 units, continuing a downward drift from the October average of ~32. For the period P31-P39, the average demand is approximately 28 units. Current on-hand inventory is 157 units with no units in transit. Given that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4), the inventory needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of 28 units/period, 157 units covers more than 5 periods (approx 5.6 periods). Therefore, the OR backend will likely not place a new order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime since early September (P31), which reflects the current fall baseline and prevents over-ordering during this seasonal trough. Lead time remains stable at 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: November demand drift: Demand in early November (P39) has dropped significantly to 8 units, lower than the October baseline of ~32 units, suggesting a potential further cooling as the year-end approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU ('Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt') has stabilized into a very low fall/winter baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged approximately 20 units (24, 38, 17, 8, 15), which is a significant reduction from the early autumn average of ~32-41 units. Current on-hand inventory is 142 units with no units in transit. Given the low demand and the lead time of 4 periods, current stock is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand at the current average. Ordering now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs as we move toward the end of the year. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in the past, though no recent orders have been placed to verify this in the current regime. I will use recent_N forecasting with N=10 to capture the downward trend over the last two months, but effectively, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders because on-hand exceeds the required base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand (P36-P40) has dropped to an average of ~20 units, down from the October baseline of ~32 units, reflecting final seasonal tail-off.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has continued its late-autumn decline, with the last 3 periods (P39-P41) averaging only 12 units (8, 15, 13). This follows the October baseline of ~32 units. On-hand inventory is currently 129 units, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate (129 units / 12 units/period), and there are no units in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 47 (leaving 6 periods remaining), the current inventory is already more than sufficient to meet all remaining demand through the end of the simulation. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to the confirmed 4 periods and use the most recent 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (~12 units/period). This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current inventory, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand regime (P39-P41) confirmed at an average of ~12 units, down from the early-November average of ~20. Current inventory of 129 units is sufficient for the remaining 6 periods of the game.

Demand over the last 4 periods (P39-P42) has averaged 14.5 units per period (8, 15, 13, 22), confirming the low-volume late-year regime. Currently, we have 107 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43 to P47) and a stable demand floor below 25 units, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs (which are equal to the profit per unit). To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect the current low demand environment, which, combined with the high on-hand inventory, will naturally result in a zero-order recommendation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has seen a significant seasonal decline from a May peak of ~284 units to a current late-autumn baseline. Recent demand (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 12.8 units per period (8, 15, 13, 22, 6). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (44, 45, 46, 47) and an existing on-hand inventory of 101 units, we have more than enough stock to cover all remaining demand. Even at a conservative estimate of 20 units per period, we would only need 80 units. Placing any new orders now would be counterproductive as the lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed today (P44) would only arrive in Period 48\u2014after the game has concluded. This would result in unnecessary holding costs for the rest of the game and inventory that cannot be sold. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current low demand regime, while the existing inventory will naturally satisfy the remaining customer needs without further ordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in a very low-demand seasonal trough (average demand P41-P44 is only ~11 units). With only 3 decision cycles remaining (including this one) and 98 units on-hand, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the rest of the game, even if demand were to spike back to October levels (~30 units/period). Given the holding cost of $1.0 per unit and the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 49 (after the game ends). Therefore, the objective is to minimize holding costs by not ordering and letting the current stock deplete. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current late-year demand baseline for the OR engine, though the high on-hand inventory relative to this demand will naturally result in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Late-year demand (December) has reached a seasonal minimum, averaging ~5 units over the last 2 weeks (P43-P44).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The carry-over insights and recent history confirm that the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a seasonal minimum demand regime. Demand over the last three periods (P43-P45) has been 6, 3, and 8 units, averaging 5.67 units. On-hand inventory is 90 units, which is significantly more than the anticipated demand for the remaining 2 periods of the game (total demand likely < 20 units). Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0/unit), and we have a large surplus that will incur holding costs until the end of the simulation, we should not place any new orders. Setting L to the promised 4 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the current low-volume December regime (N=3) will result in a base stock level far below our 90 units on-hand, effectively preventing new orders and minimizing further holding cost accumulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-80.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the final decision period (Period 47), the game ends at the conclusion of this period. Customer demand for this period will be resolved from the current on-hand inventory of 85 units. Given that the recent demand in December (P43-P46) has fallen to single digits (6, 3, 8, 5), the 85 units on hand are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Any order placed now would not arrive until Period 51 (due to the 4-period lead time), well after the game has concluded. Therefore, the priority is to avoid any further procurement and minimize holding costs on the existing surplus. I am setting parameters to ensure a zero order by keeping the base stock (mu_hat) well below the current on-hand inventory.
