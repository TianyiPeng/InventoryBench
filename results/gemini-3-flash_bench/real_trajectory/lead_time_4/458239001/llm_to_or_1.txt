Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 458239001 (Short-sleeved cotton jersey dress). History shows 5 weeks of demand with a slight upward trend (48, 47, 38, 61, 67), averaging 52.2 units per week. The latest two weeks (61, 67) suggest increasing demand as we approach spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples provide a better baseline for the current regime than a long-term average (though only 5 exist). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this initial variance and mean. The OR engine will set a base stock to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand plus safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we ordered 72 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected for L=4, nothing arrived in P1 (visible in P2 start). 62 units of demand were lost because starting inventory was 0. Historical demand over the last 6 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 11) is [48, 47, 38, 61, 67, 62]. There is a slight upward trend in the last 4 weeks (avg ~57), compared to the earlier Jan weeks (~47). Given we are in mid-February, heading towards Spring, a 'Jersey Basic' short-sleeved dress is likely to see increasing demand. I will estimate the per-period demand at 60 units. With L=4, the review+lead time demand (1+L) encompasses 5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 60 = 300. Standard deviation of the last 6 samples is ~11; sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 11 \u2248 24.6. L is set to default (4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 151 units in transit (72 ordered P1, 79 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In P1 and P2, we sold 0 units despite positive demand because arrivals haven't occurred yet. This is consistent with a lead time of 4: orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6). Historical demand samples (last 5) show a slight upward trend: 48, 47, 38, 61, 67. The recent periods P1 (62) and P2 (70) confirm this higher regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent increase (~60-70 range) compared to the older lower samples. With a lead time of 4, mu_hat needs to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Women's Jersey Basic short-sleeved dress. Historical demand (5 seed samples + 3 game periods) shows a clear upward trend: 48, 47, 38, 61, 67 (seed) followed by 62, 70, 76 (game history). The current average of the last 5 samples is approximately 67.2. As we move into March, demand for jersey dresses often increases due to seasonal warming. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in periods 1, 2, and 3 are in-transit (Total: 72+79+81 = 232). Per the timing rules, the P1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales, so we must maintain a robust base stock pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent growth while remaining conservative. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a women's jersey dress (Everyday Basics). Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been stable: [48, 47, 38, 61, 67] from Feb samples, and [62, 70, 76, 63] from game history, averaging ~59 units/week. Promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (N=1, L=4) should arrive during Period 1+4=5 and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 310 units in transit (72+79+81+78). Since the first order is not due until this period, there is no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift yet. I will set mu_hat based on the stable demand recent history (N=9, including pre-game) to capture the slight upward trend compared to the earliest samples. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility across the lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's jersey short-sleeved dress. Looking at historical demand (recent samples: 62, 70, 76, 63, 78), demand is relatively stable, averaging around 70 units per period. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand in Period 5 (78) exceeded the arrival (72). There are 269 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively. Given the consistency of lead time and demand, I will use recent history (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the default promised value of 4 periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, a basic item likely entering higher demand as Spring progresses (March/April). Current demand (Periods 5-6) is significantly higher (avg 82) than the seed data (avg 52) and early game data, suggesting a seasonal upward trend. We have experienced stockouts in the last two periods because demand (78, 86) exceeded the arrivals (72, 79). Promised lead time (4) is consistent with the arrivals observed in P5 and P6. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 272 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). To capture the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 5 periods (P2-P6) better represent the current demand profile (approx. 75 units/period) compared to the older seed data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~50 (seed) to ~75 (Periods 2-6) as Spring season begins for this short-sleeved dress.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 458239001 (Women's Short-sleeved Cotton Dress) is in a seasonal upswing corresponding to the start of Spring/Summer. Observed demand has consistently increased from the seed average (~50) to a more recent range (P5-P7) averaging 86 units/period. The actual lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (as seen in P5, P6, and P7 concludes). On-hand inventory is current 0, and we have 280 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods). However, the system has been stocking out (sold units < demand) because order quantities were based on lower historical averages. To capture the full demand spike and prevent stockouts during this high-demand season, I am adopting 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 (capturing the most recent and relevant high-demand regime) to better forecast the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: Demand stabilized at 85-95 units (avg 86) during P5-P7, significantly higher than the initial seed and early period averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, currently in early April. We are seeing a sustained upwards trend in demand as the weather warms (Spring season). Demand has climbed from ~50 to 109 units over the last 8 periods. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is 96.3 units, whereas the overall average including early February is lower. Given the strong seasonal momentum for a summer-ready item, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on all 4 arrivals to date (P5-P8). Inventory is currently critical; on-hand is 0, and we have consistently sold out everything that arrived (stockouts in P5, P6, P7, P8). Pipeline inventory (302) consists of orders from P5 (31), P6 (82), P7 (89), and P8 (100). The P5 order is expected to arrive this period (P9). I'll keep L as default (4) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand reached >100 units in P8; 4-period average (P5-P8) is 91.75 units, up from initial ~50-60. Seasonality for short-sleeved jersey dresses is peaking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is currently in its peak Spring/Summer season (mid-April). Demand analysis: While demand dipped to 54 in Period 9, the previous four periods (P5-P8) showed a strong upward regime ranging from 78 to 109 (average ~92). The dip in Period 9 is likely a fluctuation or influenced by the total stockout (sold only 31 of 54 demanded), and the broader trend remains seasonal growth. Lead-time analysis: Orders from Periods 1 through 5 have all arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods. Inventory status: We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 9 consecutive periods). Pipeline: 385 units are in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Specifically, the P6 order of 82 units is expected to arrive during Period 10. To recover and support the seasonal peak, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime observed since Period 5 (~84.2 units/period), setting mu_hat = (1+L)*84.2. I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved jersey dress, which is in peak demand during the current April/May spring season. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: early periods averaged ~60-70, while recent periods (P7-P10) have seen demand spikes up to 109, with a mean of approximately 88.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply from earlier lower-volume orders. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient base stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher seasonal volume (~90 per week) and for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the increased variance observed in this higher-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at its promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Demand for short-sleeved dress has averaged ~90 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P6-P10), compared to ~70 in earlier weeks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is currently in its peak Spring/Summer season (late April). Demand has significantly increased from the initial seed of ~50 to an average of ~95.7 over the last 6 periods (P6-P11). The most recent period (P11) saw a demand of 118, the highest yet, suggesting the peak is still active or accelerating. Despite consistent ordering, we are experiencing persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for all 11 periods) because the OR backend's default 'cap' logic and lead-time demand estimates likely lag behind this rapid seasonal climb. To address the stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~96) while excluding the lower early-period data. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (L=4). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods will increase the base stock level and help the OR engine place larger orders to finally satisfy demand and build a safety buffer.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for this 'Short-sleeved dress'. Historical demand since Period 6 has consistently averaged around 90-100 units/period (P6-P12 mean = 92), with some volatility (highs of 118, lows of 74). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory of 26 units and pipeline of 447 units (representing orders from P9 to P12) are now catching up to the increased demand regime. I will use the last 7 periods (P6-P12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current seasonal state better than the full history which includes lower winter demand. This 'recent_N' approach (N=7) ensures the backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected 5-period cycle (L+1) while accounting for recent seasonal variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $580.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, entering peak demand seasonality (mid-May). However, historical data shows high volatility: demand plummeted from ~100 units (P10-P11) to 74 (P12) and 36 (P13). This drop may be due to temporary weather changes or a lull before the high-summer peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) to average the high demand from P10-11 with the recent drop, resulting in a balanced mu_hat estimate (mean demand of ~81.25 across P10-P13). Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from P1-P9. Currently, on-hand inventory is 104 and in-transit is 391 (Orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). Total pipeline (495) significantly exceeds current demand trends, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely reduce order size to manage holding costs while pipeline inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 11: Significant drop from 118 (P11) to 36 (P13) suggests high sensitivity or potential demand stabilization at a lower level (~80) after the initial Spring spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) shows demand continuing at a lower level (50 units) compared to the April peak (>100 units). The short-sleeved jersey dress likely experienced a Spring surge that is now cooling as Summer begins. Demand over the last three periods (P12-14) averaged 53 units, a significant drop from the P8-P11 average of 94. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 166 units on-hand and 320 in-transit, there is enough supply to cover roughly 9 weeks of current demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 53.5) and reduce mu_hat, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat via recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility seen during the transition from the peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime shift confirmed: Since Period 12, demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~53 units (P12-P14), down from the Spring peak of ~95 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress. We are currently in Period 16 (late May). Analysis of recent demand shows a definitive transition from the Spring peak (~95 units/period during P6-P11) to a lower, stable post-peak regime. Demand over the last four periods (P12-P15) has been 74, 36, 50, and 53 units respectively (mean = 53.25). On-hand inventory is high at 215 units, plus an in-transit pipeline of 218 units scheduled to arrive over the next few weeks (ordered in P12-P15). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, we and the OR backend must shift to prevent significant overstocking as the seasonal demand wanes. I am setting L to 4 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrived exactly in 4 periods). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower-demand regime while discarding the irrelevant high-demand Spring peak data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 (Women's short-sleeved jersey dress) is currently experiencing a post-peak demand correction. After a significant Spring peak (Periods 8-11, mean ~100), demand dropped sharply and has since stabilized. In the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 59.8 units (74, 36, 50, 53, 86). While P16 saw a slight bump to 86, the overall trend since mid-May suggests a lower-level summer steady state compared to the April peak. On-hand inventory is currently high (248 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory (248) plus in-transit (99) totaling 347, and expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) projected at approximately 300 (using a recent 5-period mean of ~60), we are well-stocked. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower post-peak demand regime, and use default sigma calculation to account for the recent variance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (June 10). The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which experienced a spring peak from Period 7 to Period 11 (mid-April). Since Period 12, demand has settled into a new regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P12-P17), demand values were 74, 36, 50, 53, 86, and 96, resulting in a mean of approximately 65.8 units/period. The increase in the last two periods (86, 96) likely reflects late-spring/early-summer demand, but it remains significantly lower than the April peak (>100). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 210 units and 76 units in-transit (ordered in P14 and P17), our total pipeline is 286 units. Given the mean demand of ~66, we have approximately 4.3 periods of coverage, which is slightly lower than the required (L+1=5) periods. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the post-peak mean using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent stabilization and slight upward trend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which experienced a spring demand peak (P7-P11) and a subsequent stabilization period. Recently, from P16 to P18, demand has increased again (86, 96, 89), likely due to the arrival of summer (June). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 90 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (162 units) due to large orders placed during the spring peak arriving now (P15-P16 arrivals were >100 units). Demand volatility has been significant, so I will use a recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture the recent spread (approx 36 to 96) rather than the long-term history. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to capture this summer stabilization around 90 units per period (450 for the 1+L window).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization at Period 18: Demand has risen from the May low (~53) back to a stable summer mean of ~90 units (P16-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), we are managing a short-sleeved jersey dress during its peak summer season. Period 19 saw a significant demand surge to 186 units, which depleted our on-hand inventory (ending 0). Although Period 19's arrival showed 0, this is expected as the order from Period 15 was 0 units. We expect arrivals to resume in Period 21 (from Period 17). The current mean demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is (86+96+89+186)/4 = 114.25 units. While Period 19 might be an outlier spike, the start of summer (late June) typically justifies a higher baseline compared to the 90 units previously observed. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this upward shift in mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods which has been highly stable.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand surged to 186 in Period 19 (late June); 4-period mean (P16-P19) increased to 114 units, up from ~90 in early June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July 1st) for a short-sleeved jersey dress. Demand has surged aggressively from ~90 to 186 in P19 and 232 in P20, confirming a significant trend. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 462 units, but we have experienced stockouts in Period 20 because the orders from P15 and P16 were zero (following a period of high inventory in May), creating a gap in arrivals now. Although promised lead time is 4, recent orders from P15 and P16 would have arrived in P19 and P20 respectively; P15 was 0 and P16 was 0, explaining the 0 arrivals in the history. To handle the high summer demand and recover from the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent surge (mean ~150). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~90 to 200+ (mean 209 for P19-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The product is a short-sleeved jersey dress, currently in peak summer demand. Over the last three weeks (P19-P21), demand has been 186, 232, and 108 respectively (mean 175). The drop in P21 might be due to stockouts affecting realized demand measurements or a slight cooling from the late June peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P17 order arrived in P21). However, we are currently facing a massive stockout (on-hand is 0) despite a high pipeline (689 units). The orders from P15 and P16 (0 units) explain the current 'arrival gap'. The orders from P18 onward (104, 129, 194, 262) are due to arrive in P22, P23, P24, and P25. To catch the remaining summer demand, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high summer volume (~175 per period), and L is set to calculate to maintain the 4-period lead time logic. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same high-volatility window to ensure a sufficient safety buffer (z-score approximately 0.95 given profit/holding ratio).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P19-P21) shows high volatility with a mean of ~175 units, significantly higher than the early summer stabilization of ~90 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (2019/07/15). The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is in peak summer demand. Historical data shows a massive demand surge starting in late June (P19=186, P20=232, P21=108, P22=76). Although recent demand has dropped from 232 to 76, the drop is likely due to stockouts in P20 and P21 rather than a sharp drop in actual consumer interest, as on-hand inventory was nearly zero. The total in-transit quantity is high (864 units) because large orders were placed in P19-P22 to chase the summer peak. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the demand has been highly volatile (highs of 232, lows of 76), I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (P19-P22) for mu_hat, which is approximately 150.5 units per period. Over (1+L)=5 periods, this is 752.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this high-demand summer regime while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P19-P22) characterized by high volatility (range 76-232) and a higher mean (~150) compared to early summer (~90). Large pipeline inventory (864 units) is expected to arrive starting P23 to address recent stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (P24). Historical demand has been extremely volatile: surging in late June (P19-P20: 186, 232) and then dropping significantly in July (P21-P23: 108, 76, 58). This suggests the mid-summer peak for the short-sleeved dress has passed, and we are entering a lower-demand late-summer regime. The pipeline is currently very large (858 units) due to aggressive ordering during the peak. Specifically, the orders from P20 (194 units), P21 (262 units), and P22 (279 units) are expected to arrive in P24, P25, and P26 respectively. With on-hand inventory at 99 and 129 units having arrived in P23, the immediate stockout risk has been mitigated. I am reducing the demand forecast (mu_hat) by using a recent window (N=3: P21-P23) to capture the cooling demand (mean ~81). sigma_hat is set using a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the recent extreme volatility and ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock. This approach prevents further over-ordering into a potentially bloated pipeline as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Post-mid-summer demand decline: Demand has dropped from a peak of ~230 (P20) to a mean of 81 units (P21-P23), signaling the end of the primary summer surge for this SKU.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Short-sleeved dress in soft cotton jersey', which is highly seasonal. We are now in late July (Period 25). Historical demand shows a mid-summer peak in June/July (Periods 19-20 reached 186-232 units) followed by a sharp decline. The last four periods (P21-P24) saw demand of 108, 76, 58, and 94 units (average ~84). This suggests the peak-summer surge is cooling down. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. With 199 units on-hand and 664 units in-transit (from large orders placed during the stockout phase in P21-P23), the pipeline is heavily oversupplied for the current demand regime. To prevent excessive holding costs as the season ends, I will use recent demand (N=4) to set mu_hat, reflecting the post-peak level, and maintain the default lead time and sigma_hat calculation. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders given the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer decline confirmed: Demand averaged ~84 units over P21-P24, down from the June peak of >200 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (short-sleeved jersey dress) is in a post-peak summer decline as August begins. Recent demand (P21-P25) has stabilized at a lower mean of 81 units, significantly down from the mid-summer surge that peaked at 232. Looking ahead to August (P26+), demand typically continues to taper off for summer-specific apparel. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current On-hand (392) plus In-transit (402) totals 794 units. Given the recent mean of ~81 units, we have nearly 10 periods of coverage. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, covering P21-P25) to capture the lower demand regime and prevent further over-ordering while the system digests existing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: August demand transition: Post-peak summer decline confirmed; demand mean has shifted from ~150 (mid-summer) to ~81 (P21-P25) as of August 5th.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (August 12th), we are in a late summer cooling phase for this short-sleeved jersey dress. Demand has dropped significantly from the mid-summer peak (>200 units) to an average of ~62 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), with the most recent demand being only 27 units. We recently received a large push of inventory (864 units arriving P23-P26) ordered during the stockout period. Our current on-hand inventory is 644 units, which is over 10 times the current weekly demand mean. With an additional 123 units in-transit (due P27), our total inventory position (767) is excessive for the late-season demand level. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs as we approach the end of the summer season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak regime. I used N=5 for demand to capture the sharp downturn (P22-P26 demand: 76, 58, 94, 69, 27). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped from a mid-summer mean of ~150 to a mean of ~62 over P22-P26 (most recent P26 demand: 27). Large inventory surplus exists (644 on-hand vs ~60/week demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-407.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (short-sleeved jersey dress) has entered a late-summer seasonal decline. Demand has dropped significantly from the June/July peak (>200) to very low levels in August (Period 26: 27 units, Period 27: 18 units). The mean demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) is approximately 38 units. We currently have a large inventory surplus of 749 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover demand for the remainder of the season given current trends. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I am setting the lead time to the promised 4 periods and using a recent demand window (N=3) to reflect the recent collapse. This will result in a low base-stock level, ensuring no new orders are placed by the OR engine until the surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed: Mean demand fell to ~38 units over P25-P27 (from a mid-summer mean of ~150). Inventory surplus of 749 units is now the primary concern.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late August/end-of-summer period. Demand has collapsed from mid-summer peaks (~150-200 units) to a very low level, averaging 20.7 units over the last three periods (P26: 27, P27: 18, P28: 17). There is currently an inventory surplus of 732 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and the significant drop in sales for this short-sleeved jersey dress, the priority is to stop all new ordering and bleed off the existing stock. For the OR parameters, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this new low-demand regime (approximately 21 units/period), which ensures the base stock calculation remains low. Lead time L is kept at the default 4 periods as observed arrivals remain consistent with the promised lead time. This configuration will result in an order of 0, minimizing further holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand regime: Demand has stabilized at a low mean of ~21 units/period (P26-P28) as the summer season ends. Major inventory surplus (732 units) relative to current demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early September (2019/9/2), transitioning out of the peak summer demand for short-sleeved dresses. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been very low: 27, 18, 17, and 27 units respectively, confirming a stable late-season mean of approximately 22 units. The current on-hand inventory of 705 units is extremely high, covering over 30 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My primary goal is to prevent further ordering through the OR backend while maintaining a service level for the remaining seasonal demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime, which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand + pipeline inventory, effectively halting new orders and allowing the surplus to bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Early September demand regime: Demand has stabilized at a low mean of ~22 units/period (P26-P29) post-summer season. Significant inventory surplus (705 units) persists.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is a seasonal summer item. We are now in early September (Period 31), and demand has predictably collapsed as the season ends. The last five periods (P26-P30) show demand values of 27, 18, 17, 27, and 6, resulting in a mean of approximately 19 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 699 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, we have over 35 weeks of supply, which is far beyond the remaining periods in the simulation (ending at P47). There is a massive inventory surplus, and no further ordering is required. To prevent the OR backend from placing any 'safety' orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N (N=5) approach to reflect the low-demand post-summer regime, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, ensuring a zero-order recommendation.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand collapse confirmed: Period 26-30 mean demand dropped to ~19 units/period (down from mid-summer peak of ~150). Massive inventory surplus (699 units) will likely cover all demand through the end of the year.

Current on-hand inventory is 683 units, which provides over 36 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. Since the remaining game length is approximately 15 periods, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from triggering any safety-stock orders despite the high service level requirements (19:1 profit-to-holding ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to accurately reflect this low-demand regime, while relying on the massive on-hand inventory to absorb all demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '458239001' (short-sleeved jersey dress) has transitioned into a post-summer demand regime. Demand since Period 30 has remained very low (6, 16, 14), with a 3-period average of ~12 units. Current on-hand inventory is 669 units, which covers approximately 55 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the massive surplus and the seasonal nature of the product, no new orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the stable late-August/September period) to reflect this low-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand regime (post-September): Demand has stabilized at a very low level (avg ~12 units/period, P30-P32). Significant inventory surplus (669 units) effectively eliminates the need for further procurement.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 34), well past its peak summer season (June-July). Current on-hand inventory is 641 units, while the recent 8-period mean demand (P26-P33) has plummeted to approximately 19 units per period. With a lead time of 4 periods, a (L+1) coverage window requires only roughly 95 units (5 * 19). The current surplus (641 units) is more than six times the required stock levels and is expected to cover demand for the remainder of the year. To avoid accumulating further holding costs, I am maintaining orders at zero by setting the base stock parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime. Specifically, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the post-summer collapse accurately.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is entering the low-demand autumn/winter season (October). Current on-hand inventory is 630 units, while recent demand (P30-P34) has averaged only 15 units per period. With a lead time of 4 periods, a (L+1) coverage window of 5 periods requires approximately 75 units (5 * 15), making the current inventory of 630 units vastly excessive\u2014enough to cover over 40 periods at current rates. No further orders are required. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand regime using a recent_N method to capture the post-summer collapse (N=5) and using the default lead time which has remained stable at 4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is a highly seasonal item. Following a significant peak in mid-summer (June/July), demand has collapsed as we move through autumn (October). Over the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has remained consistently low, ranging from 11 to 28 units with a mean of approximately 18.6 units. Current on-hand inventory is 606 units, while the current demand level suggests a requirement of only about 90-100 units to cover the entire remaining lead-time plus review period (L+1). Given this massive surplus, no further orders are required. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current low-demand autumn regime. This will ensure the base stock levels computed by the OR engine remain well below our current on-hand inventory, preventing any unnecessary procurement and minimizing further holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (short-sleeved jersey dress) is currently in a deep post-summer seasonal low. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) being approximately 17 units per period. The current on-hand inventory of 596 units is extremely high relative to this demand, covering nearly 35 weeks of supply. No additional orders are needed. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this low-demand regime to prevent any further ordering. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~17 units per period (multiplied by 1+L by the backend) and maintaining recent volatility measures.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (October): Demand remains stable at a low level, averaging 17.4 units/period over P32-P36. Inventory surplus of 596 units exceeds expected demand for the remainder of the year.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are dealing with a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is a summer-seasonal item. In Period 37, demand was 12 units, continuing the low-demand trend observed throughout autumn. The average demand since Period 30 (September) has been approximately 15.5 units per period. We have a massive inventory surplus of 584 units on-hand with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current sales rate, this stock will last for over 35 periods, well beyond any reasonable planning horizon or the end of the year. The primary objective is to avoid any further procurement to minimize holding costs. By setting L to default (4) and utilizing a recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will compute a base stock level based on the recent low-demand regime (~15 units/period * 5 = 75 units). Since our on-hand inventory (584) vastly exceeds this base stock level, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (short-sleeved jersey dress) is in a late-autumn low-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 568 units, while the average demand over the last six periods (P33-P38) is approximately 17 units per week. Given the remaining 9 periods in the game and the current demand rate, total expected demand through Period 47 is ~153 units. The 568 units on-hand are more than triple the projected remaining demand. To avoid further increasing the significant holding costs ($1/unit/period) for a surplus that cannot be sold before the game ends, no new orders should be placed. I am setting L to default (4) and using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand stability (avg ~16 units), which ensures the base stock calculation remains far below the existing inventory, resulting in a zero order.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '458239001' is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is currently in its off-season (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 13.7 units per period over the last five weeks (P35-P39). The current on-hand inventory is 555 units, which provides over 40 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Given that we are in Period 40 of 47, this existing surplus is more than sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand for the game. To avoid increasing holding costs for a product with zero need for replenishment, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low current demand floor, effectively ensuring no new orders are placed by the OR backend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). The SKU is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, a highly seasonal summer product. Demand has remained consistently low since the end of summer, averaging approximately 15.8 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P31-P40). On-hand inventory is currently 531 units with zero units in-transit. At the current demand rate, the existing stock is sufficient to cover approximately 33 periods of demand, which extends far beyond the end of the game (Period 47). No further orders are required. The OR parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand profile and stable lead time (4 periods) to ensure the backend does not place unnecessary orders while managing the inventory surplus.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '458239001' is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is a highly seasonal summer product. As of late November (Period 42), demand has stabilized at a very low winter regime. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 16.2 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 521 units with zero in-transit. Given the historical average of ~16 units, the current stock covers approximately 32 periods of demand, which far exceeds the remaining 5 periods of the game (total periods = 47). No further orders are required. To prevent any accidental ordering by the OR backend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand environment, while lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4 correctly reflecting the system state.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is a seasonal summer item. We are currently in the low-demand winter season, although Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 57 units (likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions). Despite this spike, historical demand from Period 30 onwards has averaged approximately 18 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 464 units with zero pipeline inventory. Given that the remaining game length is 4 periods (ends at Period 47) and current average demand is low, the existing inventory of 464 units is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to a conservative level based on the recent 5-period average (including the recent spike) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the state of oversupply, and sigma_hat to default to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand check: Period 42 demand spiked to 57, but overall Q4 mean remains low (~18 units/period). Existing inventory (464) is excessive for the final 4 periods of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (December 9th). The game ends at Period 47. Current on-hand inventory is 407 units. Recent demand has slightly increased due to potential holiday effects (averaging ~57 units over the last 2 periods), but even at this rate, the remaining demand for the final 4 periods (44-47) is approximately 228 units. Our current inventory of 407 units is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand through the end of the game without any further ordering. To prevent the OR backend from placing any unnecessary orders that would only incur holding costs and never be sold, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=1 (the smallest possible value) and maintain a stable lead time parameter. Given the large surplus, the capped policy will naturally result in zero orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, with only 3 decision cycles remaining. The current on-hand inventory is 391 units, while the mean demand in this late-year regime (P41-P44) is approximately 35 units per period. Given the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive before the game ends (P45 order arrives P49 conclude). Furthermore, the current inventory is already sufficient to cover more than 10 times the expected remaining demand. The goal is to maximize total reward by avoiding unnecessary holding costs. I will set the parameters to 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders, as the base stock level calculated from current parameters would be far below the current on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 46 of 47). The current context is the Christmas/New Year week. Historically, the demand for this short-sleeved jersey dress has been very low in Q4, averaging roughly 20-30 units outside of a brief spike in late November/early December. On-hand inventory is 371 units, which is vastly more than any conceivable demand for the remaining two periods. The holding cost is $1/unit, meaning every unit held unnecessarily reduces the total reward. No further orders are needed. L is kept at default (4) as lead time is irrelevant given the surplus. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-demand winter regime (~20-30 units/period).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the game. The product is a short-sleeved cotton dress, which is currently out of season. Demand has been very low, averaging approximately 25 units per period over the last 5 weeks (including some holiday volatility). The current on-hand inventory is 362 units, with zero in-transit. This stock level is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand for this period and well beyond, even if lead times were to shift. Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and high inventory position to ensure the OR backend does not place an unnecessary final order, thereby minimizing holding costs at the end of the simulation.
