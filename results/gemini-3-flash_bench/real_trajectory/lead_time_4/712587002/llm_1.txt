Our current pipeline of 810 units already covers this requirement with a small safety buffer (810 / 150 = 5.4 periods of coverage).

{
  "rationale": "This is Period 47, the final period of the game (total periods: 47). The product is a seasonal 'Bow HW paperwaist' viscose trouser, which has concluded its lifecycle. Demand has remained at a near-zero baseline throughout November and December, with a single outlier in Period 42 (likely a small clearance-driven spike). On-hand inventory is 21 units, which is more than sufficient to cover any residual demand for this final period without incurring additional purchasing or transport costs. As this is the last decision phase, no further orders are required.",
