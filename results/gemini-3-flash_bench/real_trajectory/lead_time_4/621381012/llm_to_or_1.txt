Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this denim product shows an upward trend (0 to 41 units over the last 5 weeks). As it is mid-February, we are entering the spring fashion season, which typically sees higher demand for denim. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory (On-hand: 0) and nothing in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use N=4 for the demand mean to capture the most recent growth and N=5 for sigma to capture the full observed volatility. Standard parameters (L=4) will be used as there is no historical lead-time data yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS', which is a high-waisted skinny denim item. Historical demand (6 samples) shows an upward trend: 0 (Jan 7), 24, 29, 37, 41 (Feb 4), and the most recent Period 1 demand of 37. The average across all samples is approximately 28. Standard deviation is roughly 14. Promised lead time (L) is 4. The order of 60 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1. Since the order won't arrive for 3 more periods, we must maintain a base stock to cover demand for Period 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the rising trend in demand from 0 to 41, I will use recent_N=4 to better capture the current 'high' demand phase (~36 units/period) rather than the '0' from early January. This will ensure mu_hat reflects the higher current demand level to minimize futuras lost sales once stock arrives.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing a denim product. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (Period 1) has not yet arrived due to the 4-period promised lead time. Demand in Period 1 and 2 (37, 58) shows a significant upward trend compared to the pre-game samples (avg ~32), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Because on-hand is 0, we have lost sales. The total in-transit is 105 (60 from P1 + 45 from P2). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, orders from P1 should arrive in P5 (visible in the P6 decision phase). We must use recent data for mu_hat to capture this growth while maintaining the default lead time assumption since we have no evidence yet to suggest L differs from 4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at a fashion item (Skinny Denim) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Demand history shows an upward trend (24, 29, 37, 41) which has continued into the game periods (37, 58, 51). The average demand over the last 5 samples is approximately 43.2. Given the seasonal nature of denim in early spring and the observable growth, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in the game history (min 37, max 58). As No orders have concluded yet, L is set to default (4). Total pipeline inventory is 169 (60+45+64), which is being monitored against the expected arrival timeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 621381012 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim), a staple fashion item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 230 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (60 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (after this decision) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning demand in Periods 1-4 was lost. Demand has increased from the pre-game mean (~26) to an average of 50.75 over the last 4 periods. Given we have no visible arrivals yet to contradict the promised lead time, I will stick to L=4. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent mean of the last 4 samples (~51) scaled by (1+L) to account for the current period plus the lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly from the recent volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a seasonal denim item. Reviewing historical demand (including the seed data), demand has shifted from an average of ~30 in January to ~50-60 in February and March. Period 5 confirmed the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived at the end of P5). Currently, on-hand is low (16) and demand is outstripping initial supply, though a large pipeline (212 units) is in transit. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the higher February/March levels, as the earlier January data (0, 24, 29, 37) is now too low compared to current performance (44-58). Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods was validated by the P1 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~30 to ~53 units/period (+75%). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The carry-over insight confirms a demand regime shift starting in Feb 2019, where demand increased from a mean of ~30 to ~53 units per period. The last six periods show demand values of 37, 58, 51, 57, 44, and 58, which supports a mean of approximately 50.8 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order arrived in P6). On-hand inventory is low (3 units) because previous periods had 0 stock due to the initial lead time. With In-transit at 203 units (orders from P3-P6: 64+61+42+36 = 203), the pipeline is full. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure L is set to the confirmed 4 periods. This helps the OR engine maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at the current higher demand level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are managing SKU 621381012. The product is a seasonal fashion item (high-waisted skinny jeans), and demand has stabilized around a mean of 53.4 units/period since Early February (Periods 1-7 demand: 37, 58, 51, 57, 44, 58, 56). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 7 (arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3 all showed exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 11, with 204 units in transit (expected arrivals in Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Given the stability of the current demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture specifically the post-February behavior, rather than the lower Jan samples. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods aligns with observed reality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the SKU 621381012 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) continues in a stable growth regime. The current demand since Feb 2019 (last 8 periods) has averaged 52.8 units with a low standard deviation (~6.9), compared to the initial January mean of ~26. All shipments from Periods 1-4 have arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods, confirming lead-time stability. On-hand inventory is 12, with a pipeline of 202 (orders from periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). My parameters target a base stock sufficient for the L+1 period window. Based on the consistent 8-period demand segment, I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current +75% demand regime while ignoring the outdated January baseline. This provides the OR engine with the most relevant mean and variance to maintain high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a skinny denim trouser. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 1, where the mean demand increased from ~30 to ~53 units per period. The recent demand (Periods 2-9) has been consistently near this higher level (ranging 39-60). Specifically, since the 'conclude' messages started showing sales in Period 5, we observe a mean of approximately 51.5 per week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across five arrivals (Periods 5-9). Currently, on-hand inventory is 15 and in-transit is 225. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand regime (last 8 periods of history available in the prompt: 58, 51, 57, 44, 58, 56, 60, 39), the mean is 52.875 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat should be approximately (1+4) * 53 = 265 units. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(last 8 samples), where the std is roughly 7.14, giving a sigma_hat of approximately 16. The OR backend will use these to maintain the base stock level against the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 240).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is skinny denim trousers. Looking at the history, demand showed a high-regime phase (approx. 55 units/week) from Feb to early April, but the last two periods (P9 and P10) show a significant drop to 39 and 23 units respectively. This suggests a potential cooldown in demand post-spring peak or a regime shift. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this recent slowing while still accounting for recent volume. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high holding costs relative to profit ($1 vs $4), maintaining an efficient inventory is crucial to avoid erosion of margins. Pipeline inventory is currently 228, which is roughly 4-5 weeks of supply at current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected starting April (Period 9): Demand dropped from a ~55 average to 31 average over the last two weeks (-43%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 9 (April), demand has decelerated from a high-growth regime (~55 units/period) to a lower level (~32 units/period). This drop (39, 23, 34 in periods 9-11) suggests a shift away from the early spring peak for these skinny jeans. Currently, we have 59 units on-hand and 163 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 12). The pipeline is quite full compared to the current slower demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while the pipeline clears. This sets mu_hat based on the average of ~32 units/period scaled for (L+1) periods, which matches the current inventory situation.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a fashion item that exhibited a peak in February/March and is currently in a sustained demand deceleration. Historical demand since Period 9 has slowed to a mean of approximately 30.4 units (39, 23, 34, 26). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 12's arrivals. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 92, In-transit: 104) are significant relative to current demand. With a target base stock coverage of (L+1) = 5 periods, the required system inventory is approximately 150-160 units (30 mean * 5 periods + safety stock). Since total inventory (196 units) exceeds this, the OR backend will naturally throttle ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has been stable.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has clearly decelerated from the Feb-March peak of ~55 units/period to a sustained lower regime averaging approximately 31 units per period over the last five weeks (P9-P13: 39, 23, 34, 26, 32). This cooling off aligns with post-spring seasonal shifts for skinny denim in the Divided collection. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 125 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. Combined with 39 units in-transit (due next period), we have sufficient coverage. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while demand is low, mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (capturing the 31 average) and sigma_hat is adjusted to match recent volatility. The OR engine's 'capped policy' will likely result in zero or small orders until inventory levels normalize against this lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~31 units/period since Period 9 (Late April), representing a persistent 40-45% drop from the early spring peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for skinny denim jeans has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the early spring peak. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand averaged 37.8 units, though Period 14 saw a sharp spike to 73, potentially a mid-May promotional or seasonal blip. The '91 units on-hand' is high relative to this recent average demand. Current lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 units in-transit (ordered P14) and 91 on-hand, total inventory is 94 units. Given L=4, we need base stock to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 6 periods to calculate mean and variance addresses both the lower stabilized regime and the recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering while maintaining enough stock to handle the inventory transition before the next arrival cycle.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 (Late May). The demand history for SKU 621381012 shows a significant shift. After a peak in early spring (P4-P8), demand dropped to ~31 units/period between P9-P13. However, the last two periods (P14-P15) show a sudden spike (73 and 67 units), possibly related to late May seasonal transitions or sales events. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is now low (24) following the recent demand surge. In-transit inventory is 71 (P14 order of 3, P15 order of 68), with 3 units expected next period and 68 arriving in 4 periods. Given the recent variability (high demand in the last two weeks vs. the prior lull), I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers P9-P15) to balance the low mid-spring baseline with the current high-demand data. This provides a mean of ~42, which better protects against the recent volatility while preventing excessive overstock if demand cools again.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May (P14-15), with demand jumping from ~31 to ~70 units/period (+125%), likely seasonal.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Divided Collection' skinny denim trouser. Current date is June 3, 2019. We have observed a significant demand spike in late May (P14-16), with demand averaging 64 units over the last 3 periods (73, 67, 52), which is consistent with early summer retail patterns for denim. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 16 (sold 24 vs demand 52). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders from P11, P12, and P13 resulted in 0 units (calculated by the OR backend previously), leading to an empty pipeline for the next 3 weeks until the orders from P14 (3 units), P15 (68 units), and P16 (75 units) arrive. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this higher summer demand regime and ensure the base stock is high enough to recover from the current stockout and cover the demand during and immediately after the lead period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike confirmed (P14-16): Demand mean increased to ~64 units/period compared to the previous stabilization at ~31 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) has entered a summer demand surge starting around Period 14 (mid-May), with recent demand averaging 71.25 units over the last 4 periods (73, 67, 52, 92). Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) with a stockout in Period 17, and significant demand (92) was lost. The 'In-transit' quantity of 228 accounts for orders from Periods 14 (3 units - should have arrived), 15 (68 units), 16 (75 units), and 17 (82 units). Based on history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The Period 14 order (3 units) did not conclude in Period 17, but it was extremely small; the first major replenishment (68 units from Period 15) is expected to arrive during the current Period 18 and be visible in the next period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this summer peak (mean ~71.25) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly to ensure the base stock covers current high demand and regains service level. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed for June: Demand for skinny denim has spiked, averaging 71 units/period (P14-P17) compared to the spring average of 31.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', with the most recent demand samples (P17, P18) recorded at 92 units/period. The average demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) is approximately 75 units, reflecting a clear regime shift from the spring average of 31. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), with several stockouts occurring due to this rapid demand acceleration. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. While there is a large pipeline (324 units), these orders (placed in P15, P16, P17, P18) will only begin arriving in P19, P20, P21, and P22 respectively. To capture the current peak while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the summer average (~75 units/period) and sigma_hat using the same window to ensure the OR backend's service level logic accounts for the recent demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a severe summer demand surge. Demand in Period 19 reached a season-high of 111, and the average over the last five periods (P15-P19) is approximately 82.8 units/period. The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 despite an arrival of 68 units in Period 19, leading to significant stockouts. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With lead time (L) of 4, the system must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline (in-transit) is 341 units, which includes orders from P16 (75), P17 (82), P18 (99), and P19 (85). Based on the current demand pace (approx. 83-111 units), a base stock covering 5 periods would require roughly 415-500 units. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P15-P19) to capture the sharp upward trajectory of the summer trend and use the same window for volatility to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified: Late June demand (P19) reached 111 units, significantly exceeding the previous June average of 71. The 5-period moving average has climbed to ~83 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Skinny Denim) is in a high-demand summer peak. While demand in Period 20 dropped to 46, the preceding periods showed a strong upward trend (92, 92, 111). The drop to 46 might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as summer fashion demand typically remains elevated through July. We are currently facing low inventory (29 on-hand) due to stockouts in Periods 16-19. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), the OR engine needs to prioritize service levels. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers from P14 to P20, capturing the summer ramp-up) to maintain a base stock that accounts for the peak, even with the recent P20 dip. For sigma_hat, N=7 will also capture the high volatility seen during this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility confirmed: Late June (P20) saw a transient dip to 46 units after a peak of 111, but the 5-period moving average remains high (~78 units/period) compared to spring levels (~31 units/period).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in a high-demand summer regime for high-waisted skinny denim. In the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been 92, 92, 111, 46, and 72, resulting in a recent mean of 82.6 units/period. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 24.5. The 'Period 21 conclude' message confirms that the order from Period 17 arrived with a lead time of 4 periods, maintaining the consistent L=4 pattern. We currently have 39 units on-hand and 314 units in-transit. A significantly higher demand level is expected throughout July. By setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, we capture this recent summer peak volatility and mean. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 413 units), which, minus the pipeline (353 units), will generate an order to ensure we don't stock out during this active season while accounting for the high per-period holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) average demand is ~83 units/period (P17-P21) with high volatility (std ~25).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a high-waisted jean. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 17 (early June), we have entered a higher-demand summer regime. Recent demand samples starting from Period 17 are: 92, 92, 111, 46, 72, 67. This averages approximately 80 units/period, compared to the spring average of ~31. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4) as arrivals are consistent. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering the summer regime since P17) to capture the current mean of ~80 units/period. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in the summer months (ranging from 46 to 111). The OR backend will use these to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, targeting a base stock of roughly 400+ safety stock. With 71 on-hand and 322 in-transit (Total=393), the current position is near the required level, but mu_hat and sigma_hat need to reflect the summer peak to prevent stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the height of the July summer season for skinny denim (Period 24, July 22). Demand remains high and volatile: the last 10 periods (P14-P23) averaged 72.1 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is 82.6 units. The product frequently stocks out despite incoming shipments, indicating a need for a robust base stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand at 42 units and a substantial pipeline of 288 units, the current goal is to stabilize the inventory level to meet the ~80 unit/period demand while being mindful of the 4-period lead time. Using N=10 for mu_hat (covering the summer surge) provides a mean of 72.1, which when scaled by (1+L=5) targets a base stock of 360 units. Pipeline (288) + On-hand (42) = 330, suggesting an order of ~30 units to reconcile against future demand. I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained through mid-July: Demand average for P19-P23 is 82.6 units/period, showing significant volatility (standard deviation ~28).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (late July). The SKU is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', which has exhibited a sustained summer demand peak since mid-June. Demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) has been highly volatile but averaged approximately 77.5 units/period (111, 46, 72, 67, 114, 55). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 104, with a significant pipeline of 278 units (orders from P21-P24). The strategy is to maintain a high base stock to cover the summer surge while managing the high volatility (std dev of ~28 in recent weeks). I will use a recent N of 6 to capture this specific summer regime for both mean and variance, which reflects the current sustained demand level of ~77.5 units/period, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for this 5-period horizon (L+1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (Period 26). We have been in a high-demand summer regime since Period 14, with the recent 5-period average (P21-P25) at approximately 76 units/period (72, 67, 114, 55, 73). While significantly higher than the spring average, demand shows high volatility (std dev ~22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 44, and we have a large pipeline of 325 units (including orders from P22-P25 totaling 325 units). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent summer demand intensity and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the current high volatility. Lead time is set to default as the promised 4 periods align with observations.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a high-demand summer regime for this SKU (skinny denim). Recent demand has been volatile but strong, with P23 at 114, P24 at 55, P25 at 73, and P26 at 116. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 85 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P22 arriving at P26, ordered at P22). To capture this higher summer mean and account for significant volatility (std dev ~27), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering the mid-July to August peaks) and keeping L calculated based on observed arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381012 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing a massive late-summer demand surge. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 173 units, drastically exceeding the previous summer average of ~83. The 5-period moving average has risen from 82.6 to 106.2. This is likely driven by 'Back-to-School' shopping in mid-to-late August, which is a peak season for denim and high-waisted jeans. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 344 units in transit. Given the significant jump to 173 (a 50%+ increase over previous peaks), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this upward momentum and increase the volatility estimate via sigma_hat recent_N=5 to account for the supply-chain-straining variability. This ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to prevent further stockouts during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed in mid-August: Demand increased from a summer average of ~83 to 173 (+108%) in Period 27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a significant 'Back-to-School' demand regime. In Period 27 (Aug 12), demand spiked to 173, and in Period 28 (Aug 19), it increased further to 194. This represents a more than 100% increase over the summer average (~83 units). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and facing stockouts (lost sales in P27 and P28). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this rapid escalation (P26-P28), which aligns with late-August retail trends for denim. This forces the base_stock calculation to reflect the ~160+ units/period demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P22-P24 orders arrived exactly on schedule in P26-P28).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak intensified in late August: Demand reached 194 in P28, following 173 in P27 (Avg ~183), confirming a sustained regime shift from the summer average of 83 (+120%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School demand surge is in full effect, with demand levels over the last three weeks being 173, 194, and 150 (Period 29 showed a slight decrease but remains significantly higher than summer levels). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 172 units/period. The current date (September 2) typically marks the peak or the immediate post-peak of Back-to-School shopping for denim. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while recognizing the slight softening in P29. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand, the goal is to maintain a high base stock to avoid further stockouts during this high-profit seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime (Late Aug/Early Sept) confirmed at ~172 units/period (P27-P29). Demand softened slightly in Period 29 (150) compared to peak (194).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09 (Period 31), following the Back-to-School (BTS) peak season for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim'. Period 30 demand was 195 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime that started around Period 27 (mid-August). The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 178 units/period, with a peak of 195. Although the BTS peak starts to wind down in late September, demand for high-waisted skinny denim remains seasonally relevant through early autumn. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and the pipeline (742 units) includes several large recent orders (P28 order: 182, P29 order: 228, P30 order: 209). However, due to lead time (4 periods), the P27 order of 123 units is expected to arrive this period (P31), but will only be visible in the next Period's conclude message. To maintain high service levels while demand is at its peak regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the ~178 average, and keep L at 4 as lead times have been consistent. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak sustained into early September: 4-period average (P27-P30) is 178 units/period, significantly higher than the summer average of 83.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), it is evident that the Back-to-School demand peak is beginning to transition into the mid-autumn period. Historically, the peak demand occurred between P27-P30 (avg ~178). Recent demand in P29-P31 (150, 195, 156) shows high volatility but a slight cooling from the 190+ peaks. However, 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is a staple trouser item likely to maintain a high baseline throughout autumn. We are currently facing zero on-hand inventory and relying entirely on the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P28 onwards). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels while accounting for the recent high-volume regime, mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the full Back-to-School surge (P27-P31 mean approx 174 per period, giving mu_hat around 870 for the 5-period window). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the significantly increased variance seen during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime has stabilized at a high level (avg ~174 units/period for P27-P31) with high volatility (std ~22), significantly higher than the summer average of 83.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the 'Back-to-School' demand regime which started around Period 27 (mid-August). The average demand for this period (P27-P32) is approximately 169 units/period (173, 194, 150, 195, 156, 148), with a standard deviation of approximately 21. While demand has slightly softened from the immediate peak of 194-195 to around 150, it remains substantially higher than the summer average of 83. The lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P28 order arrived in P32). Pipeline inventory is high (726 units), reflecting large orders placed during the peak. To avoid over-ordering as the fall season matures, I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific characteristics of this high-demand regime while allowing for the slight recent deceleration.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime (P27-P32) average is ~169 units/period, showing a slight deceleration from the initial peak but remaining ~100% higher than summer levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School demand peak has transitioned into a high-volume late-September regime. Period 33 demand reached 219, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (P28-P32) of ~168. This suggests sustained high demand for skinny denim as we enter the autumn season. The current on-hand inventory is 43, while there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 625 units aimed at covering the high demand seen over the last few weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase while managing the risk of overstocking if demand mean-reverts after the seasonal peak, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=7 (from Period 27) captures the entire Back-to-School and early Autumn regime, providing a robust mean and variance estimate reflecting current market conditions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 219, pushing the recent regime (P27-P33) average to ~176 units/period, roughly double the summer average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in mid-August (Back-to-School). While demand fluctuated, the average from Period 27-34 is approximately 172 units/period. The most recent demand (P34) was 132, which is a dip from the previous peak of 219 (P33), but still aligns with the high-volatility Autumn pattern. On-hand inventory has recovered to 120 units due to the arrival of 209 units (ordered P30). With a lead time of 4 periods and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio supporting high service levels, I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent 8-period mean (N=8, covering P27-P34) to capture the current regime's strength while dampening the impact of the latest single-period drop. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility (std ~26) observed during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P34) average confirmed at ~172 units/period with significant volatility (std ~26). Demand levels remain double the summer average despite periodic fluctuations.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Skinny Denim) is transitioning out of the high 'Back-to-School' and 'Autumn' demand peaks into a likely quieter mid-October period. Observation from Period 34 (132 units) and Period 35 (75 units) shows a significant demand cooling compared to the P27-P33 average of ~176 units. Based on this sharp deceleration over the last two weeks, I am identifying a new demand regime. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend (averaging P33-P35: (219+132+75)/3 = 142 units/period) while remaining conservative enough to avoid massive stockouts if volatility persists. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P35 arrived P31 order). Inventory position (233 on-hand + 603 in-transit) is healthy, but current high in-transit levels suggest we should signal the OR solver to moderate ordering as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime detected: Late Autumn (Oct) demand has dropped from ~172 average to ~75-132 in the last two periods (P34-35), suggesting the end of the seasonal peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for high-waisted skinny denim has entered a significant cooling phase as we move into late October (Period 37). The Autumn/Back-to-School peak (P27-P33), which averaged ~176 units/period, has ended. The last three periods (P34-P36) show a clear downward trend with demand values of 132, 75, and 69. This results in a 3-period average of ~92 units/period, roughly a 48% drop from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 265 and a pipeline of 513, we are well-covered for the current downward trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this cooling regime quickly and avoid building excessive inventory at a $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: October demand has transitioned from the Autumn peak (~172) to a lower regime averaging ~92 units/period over P34-P36 (-46.5%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 621381012 has entered a 'cooling regime' following the Autumn/Back-to-School peak. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with recent observations for October (Periods 34-37) being 132, 75, 69, and 71 units. This confirms a significant shift from the previous average of ~172 units/period to a new mean of approximately 87 units/period (N=4). On-hand inventory is currently high (321 units) and there is a substantial pipeline (386 units), largely due to orders placed during the high-demand period that are now arriving. Specifically, the orders from P34 (221 units) and P35 (154 units) are expected in the next two periods. Given the high on-hand and in-transit inventory relative to the new, lower demand mean, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the cooling trend. This will prompt the OR engine to scale back orders to avoid excessive holding costs, as the current total inventory (707 units) already covers roughly 8 periods of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (Oct) confirmed: New mean of ~87 units/period (P34-P37) compared to Autumn peak of ~172 units (-49%).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381012 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is now in a confirmed 'demand cooling' regime as of early November. Following the Back-to-School/Autumn peak (which averaged ~172 units/period), demand has dropped significantly. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand values were 132, 75, 69, 71, and 82, establishing a new stable average of approximately 86 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 460 units, which is enough to cover over 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (86 * 5 = 430). With an additional 165 units in-transit (part of which is the 154 units ordered in P35 arriving in P39), the total pipeline inventory is more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering during this cooling phase. No order is expected to be placed by the OR engine given the current inventory surplus.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'cooling' demand regime following the Autumn peak. Demand over the last five periods (P35-P39) has averaged 70 units (75, 69, 71, 82, 53), significantly lower than the P27-P34 average of ~172. Current on-hand inventory is 561 units, which covers approximately 8 periods of demand at the current rate (70 units/period). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders being placed as long as our pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) exceeds the calculated base stock. To facilitate this, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, covering the shift from peak to cool) to reflect the lower demand accurately and minimize further holding costs. L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (Late Oct/Nov) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~70 units/period (P35-P39) following the Autumn peak of ~172 units (-59%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has cooled significantly since its autumn peak. The current demand regime (Late Oct/Nov) is stabilized at approximately 70 units per period (P35-P40 average is ~67 units). We are entering mid-November, and while jeans can be year-round, the current inventory level of 518 units is very high relative to this recent demand. At the current rate (~70 units/period), the 518 units on-hand will cover over 7 periods of demand, which exceeds the combined review and lead time (1+4=5 periods). There are no units in-transit, as all orders up to Period 36 have arrived. Period 37-40 had zero orders. Given the high on-hand inventory (518) vs the safety target (~350-400 units based on current mean), I will continue to set parameters that prevent new ordering to burn off the excess inventory and minimize holding costs ($1/unit). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (~67 mean).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a late-autumn/early-winter cooling regime. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 61.2 units (71, 82, 53, 54, 46), which is a significant drop from the Autumn peak of ~172. Currently, there is an inventory of 472 units on hand with 0 in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are protected for approximately 7-8 periods at current demand levels. Since we are entering the end-of-year period and nearing the end of the simulation (P42 of 47), maintaining a high inventory is not advisable due to holding costs ($1/unit). The current inventory (472) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods if demand remains in the ~60 units/period range. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the cooling trend, which will naturally lead the OR backend to place zero orders given the high on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a cooling phase (Late Nov): Mean demand for P37-P41 is ~61 units/period, down from the October average of ~87 units and the Autumn peak of ~172 units.

The current 'on-hand' inventory of 397 units is significantly higher than any projected needs for the next 5 periods (base stock level), given the recent average demand (P38-P42) is approximately 66 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to liquidate the excess inventory to minimize holding costs without risking stockouts. No additional units should be ordered at this time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in a low-demand cooling regime following the Autumn peak. Demand over the last five periods (P39-P43) has averaged 49.6 units, but the most recent sample was very low (20). On-hand inventory is currently 377 units, which is significantly high given the current demand rate and the fact that there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (total 47 periods). With 377 units on hand and a mean demand around 50, we have over 7 periods of supply, which is more than enough to cover the remaining lifespan of the SKU without further ordering. The goal now is to minimize holding costs while ensuring no stockouts. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the late-season stabilization, which results in a base stock level well below our current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling has reached a new low in December (P43: 20 units). Current inventory (377) is sufficient to cover all remaining periods (P44-P47) based on the current mean (~50 units/period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, approaching the end of the simulation. The current date is mid-December, and demand has significantly cooled from the Autumn peak of ~172 units/period to a recent regime (P40-P44) averaging approximately 45 units/period. The on-hand inventory is 348 units with 0 in-transit. Given that only 3 periods remain (P45, P46, P47) and the total expected demand for these periods is approximately 135 units (based on the current mean of 45), the existing stock of 348 is more than double what is needed. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales, as the simulation ends in Period 47. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a very low level to ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a terminal cooling phase in December, averaging ~45 units/period (P40-P44). Inventory levels (348) are sufficient to cover all remaining demand until the game ends at Period 47.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, the penultimate period of the game. On-hand inventory is 322 units, and the recent demand regime (December) has significantly cooled, averaging approximately 25 units per period over the last three weeks (P43-P45). Given that there are only two periods remaining (P46 and P47), the total expected demand until the end of the simulation is roughly 50-60 units. The current on-hand inventory of 322 far exceeds any possible remaining demand. Therefore, no further replenishment is required. Setting parameters to 'default' or maintaining zero orders will prevent unnecessary holding costs while ensuring 100% service level for the final stages. L is kept at default (4) as no lead time drift has been recently observed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is now at Period 47, which is the final period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 295 units, while the demand for the last several periods (P43-P46) has been very low, ranging from 20 to 29 units. Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until long after the game has concluded (Period 51). Furthermore, the existing inventory of 295 units is more than sufficient to cover any foreseeable demand for this final period. Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. I will maintain the current parameters but, effectively, the OR backend's capped policy and the high inventory level will result in zero orders. I'll use recent_N for demand to reflect the current end-of-year cooling phase (approx. 25-30 units/period).
