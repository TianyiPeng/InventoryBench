Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU '712216001', a V-neck vest top. The historical demand shows a clear downward trend from early January (120 units) to early February (73 units), suggesting a post-holiday/early-year cooling period. However, as we approach spring, demand for 'vest tops' and 'everyday collection' items typically stabilizes or slowly increases. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to place an order that covers the inventory for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~85.6 units/week) rather than the higher early January peaks. Setting L to 'default' matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's v-neck vest top, which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) average 85.6 units/week. Period 1 demand was 91 units, but with 0 units on-hand, we sold 0. I ordered 120 units in Period 1, which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning this arrival is expected in Period 1+4=5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Since there is a significant backlog of demand (91 lost sales in P1) and the item is out of stock, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples plus the latest observation (averaging approx 86.5) to ensure we cover the lead time + review period. I will use the default lead time (4) as we have no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promised one.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'V-neck top in woven fabric with spaghetti shoulder straps', a spring/summer item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was 120, 87, 80, 68, 73. Periods 1 and 2 (Feb 11-18) saw higher actual demand (91 and 106) compared to the pre-game baseline. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 237 in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, orders from P1 and P2 are not yet expected to arrive (P1 expected P5, P2 expected P6). Currently, we are losing sales due to zero on-hand inventory. Given the seasonal nature and recent uptick in Feb demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent trend including the in-game demand spikes. For L and sigma, I will use default settings until we have observed arrival data to verify actual lead times.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is a 'V-neck top in woven fabric with spaghetti shoulder straps', which is a seasonal spring/summer item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged 85.6 units/week. Since the start of the simulation (Periods 1-3), realized demand has been 91, 106, and 91, indicating a slight upward trend as we enter March (average 96). Inventory is currently 0, with 351 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (placed Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. No shipments are yet overdue. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to catch the slight upward trend (approx 96 units/period), covering L+1 (5) periods. Sigma will be based on recent volatility. L remains default as we have no data to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a women's V-neck vest top, a staple seasonal item for spring/summer. Historical demand samples (avg ~85) and the first 4 game periods (avg ~98) show a relatively stable but slightly increasing demand as we move into March. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have just passed their promised delivery window but are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5, which means they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (available at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 462 units in transit (covering roughly 4.7 periods of demand). Since no shipments have 'concluded' yet, there is no evidence to change the lead time from the default. I will use the last 4 periods of game data (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect a higher demand mean (98.0) compared to the pre-game samples (85.6), likely tracking the start of the spring season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's V-neck vest top, a staple item. Looking at the history, the first order (P1) arrived in P5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Historical demand samples (including the seed data) show values ranging from 68 to 120. Recent demand (P1-P5) has stabilized between 91 and 106, with a mean of approximately 97. The pipeline currently has 386 units (from orders in P2, P3, P4, and P5), which are expected to arrive in P6, P7, P8, and P9 respectively. On-hand inventory is 27. Since the product is a spring/summer staple ('Vest top') and we are entering late March, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stable demand seen during the simulation period, and default for lead time as the promised 4 periods was just confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand regime stable near 100 units/week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/25. The product is a V-neck vest top (Basics/Everyday). Demand over the first 6 periods has averaged 89 units/week, though Period 6 saw a dip to 49. Historically, including pre-game data, the mean is roughly 89 with a standard deviation of ~19. We have confirmed the lead time L=4 (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6, respectively). The on-hand inventory is 95, and in-transit is 355 (covering upcoming arrivals from P3, P4, P5, and P6 orders). Given the service level target q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, we use recent data (N=6) to estimate mu and sigma, accounting for the recent demand volatility and ensuring the pipeline (base stock for L+1=5 periods) remains replenished as the vest top enters the spring season. The dip in Period 6 is treated as variance rather than a regime shift, so we use the last 6 samples to smooth the forecast.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's V-neck top (spring/summer apparel). Historical demand samples (73-120) and recent period demand (91, 106, 91, 104, 93, 49, 62) show a slight downward trend or stabilization as we enter early April. The mean demand of the last 7 periods is approximately 85 units, but the most recent two periods (49, 62) are lower. However, looking at the full history including pre-game samples, the mean is closer to 86-90. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the actual realized demand since Period 1. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 275, consisting of orders from P4 (111), P5 (44), P6 (86), and P7 (34). These are expected to arrive in P8, P9, P10, and P11 respectively. With 147 on-hand and 275 coming, the coverage is roughly 422 units against an expected demand of ~425 over the (L+1)=5 period window. Since inventory is nearly balanced with expected demand, I will use default or recent_N parameters to allow the OR backend to maintain the service level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The SKU is a 'Vest top' which aligns with early spring demand in the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Analysis of historical data (Period 1-8) shows an average demand of approximately 90 units per week. While earlier samples (initial 5) averaged 85.6, recent performance indicates some fluctuation (dropping to 49/62 in Periods 6 and 7 before rebounding to 114 in Period 8). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promise. Our current on-hand inventory (144) is healthy, and with 209 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8), we are well-positioned to meet immediate demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent history of this SKU, ensuring we smooth out the volatility seen in the last three weeks while acknowledging the current demand level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's vest top (spaghetti strap), which enters its peak seasonal demand period during Spring/Summer. Historical demand samples (avg 85.6) and game history (avg ~90 over 9 periods) show relative stability, but a recent spike to 114 in P8 suggests the start of seasonal growth. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period duration is stable. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent activity (Periods 5-9 mean ~80.8) while accounting for potential Easter/Spring demand increases. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 103 and in-transit at 291 (total 394), the system is well-positioned for the lead-time window.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU is a women's V-neck vest top, a product typically experiencing increasing demand as we move into late spring and summer. Historical demand samples (73-120 per week) and recent game history (average 85-100) suggest a stable demand regime, though we should prepare for a potential seasonal uptick. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promised). On-hand inventory is 90, with 263 units in transit. Orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10 are expected to arrive in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively. Total pipeline + on-hand is 353 units, which covers roughly 3.5 to 4 weeks of demand at the current average. Given the product type and date, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the stable but slightly fluctuating demand observed since the first arrivals began in Period 5, ensuring we maintain a safety stock for seasonal growth without incurring excessive holding costs (which are $1 per unit vs $4 profit).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable between 85-105 units/week since Period 8. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's V-neck woven vest top, which is entering its peak seasonal period in late spring/early summer. Demand has been relatively stable but recently showed a slight upward trend, reaching 121 units in Period 11. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 3 units on-hand, we are critically low, though 340 units are in transit. The arrivals for the next few periods (orders from P8, P9, P10, P11) are expected to be 45, 126, 58, and 111 units respectively. Given the seasonal transition, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) to capture the trend of increasing demand (avg ~105) while ensuring the OR engine targets enough stock for 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand shows early signs of seasonal increase as of P11 (121 units), trending above the previous 85-105 range.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). The product is a women's v-neck top (spring/summer seasonal). Demand has transitioned from a stable 85-115 range to showing higher peaks (121 in P11). In P12, demand was 76, but ending inventory was 0, indicating a stockout occurred because sales were capped at 48 (the available starting inventory). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 427, the system needs to re-establish a safety buffer to handle the volatility seen in the last few periods and the potential seasonal uptick for May/June. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility (sigma) and local mean demand (approx 100 units/period) while maintaining the explicit lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Stockout occurred (sold 48 against demand of 76). Demand remains volatile (76-121) as the season progresses into May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13 (mid-May), entering the peak season for women's spaghetti strap tops. Historical lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Recent demand has shown volatility (P11: 121, P12: 76, P13: 52), which might be due to external factors like weather, as the product type is highly seasonal. To avoid under-ordering during the potential summer climb, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent regime shifts while remaining responsive to the trend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last few periods (712216001). Total in-transit (405) and on-hand (74) are being tracked; the OR backend will calculate the order based on the critical ratio of 0.8.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains stable at 4 periods through Period 13. Demand has become more volatile entering May (range 52-121).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/20. The product is a woven V-neck top, which is seasonally relevant for late spring/early summer. Recent demand has fluctuated: 121 (P11), 76 (P12), 52 (P13), and 54 (P14). This suggests a cooling off or volatility after a late-April peak. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Although there was a stockout in P12, the current on-hand (78) and in-transit (350) total 428 units. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P8-P14) is approximately 84.5 units/week. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 will provide a baseline of ~422 units (84.5 * 5), which aligns well with our current total inventory position. Given the recent drop in demand from the 100+ range to the 50s, a shorter window (N=7) is appropriate to avoid over-ordering as we enter the height of the season when demand might stabilize or shift again.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: P11-P14 range [52, 121] with a recent 2-week average of 53 units, down from the P8-P11 average of 102.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a 'Vest top/V-neck top' which is a seasonal summer item. Historical demand analysis shows a stable period (P5-P10) averaging ~85 units, followed by a transition into May where volatility increased. Recent demand (P13-P15) has settled significantly lower at an average of 53.6 units/week compared to the April peak. This suggests the initial seasonal spike in P11 (121 units) was transitory or that high-spring demand has cooled before the peak summer. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P11 order today. We have 134 units on hand and 292 in transit (total 426). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (0.8 critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent cooling trend (avg ~77.6 across P11-P15), which results in a base stock target covering 5 periods of demand. This balances the recent lower volume with the volatility observed in early May.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled in second half of May: avg decreased from ~100 to 54 units/week over the last 3 periods (P13-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17 (June 3, 2019). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection V-neck top', which usually enters peak demand during summer months. However, historical demand from the second half of May (P14-P16) has been consistently lower, averaging approximately 55 units per period (54, 55, 57), compared to higher levels in April. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With 209 units on hand and 160 in transit (from orders in P13, P14, P15), the current inventory position is high (369 units). At the recent demand rate of ~55/week, the pipeline covers over 6 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs, I will lower mu_hat to reflect the recent demand trend (last 4 periods) and use recent volatility (sigma_hat) for a more targeted safety stock. I'll use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (N chosen based on the shift observed since P13).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower level in late May (avg ~55 units units/week over P13-P16) following an April peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a women's vest top (summer-relevant). Analysis of demand shows a clear regime shift: Period 8-11 averaged ~105 units/week (April peak). Starting Period 13 (late May), demand dropped significantly and has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) at an average of 51.8 units/week (52, 54, 55, 57, 41). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 272 and in-transit at 56 (Total pipeline: 328), and a current demand rate of ~52 units/week, we have approximately 6.3 weeks of cover. Since lead time + review period is 5 weeks (L+1), we are currently overstocked. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this lower demand regime (approx 52 units/week). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a Women's Vest Top, which typically sees peak demand in spring/early summer. Historical demand data shows a clear shift: demand averaged ~100 units from mid-April through early May (Periods 8-11), but has dropped significantly in June, averaging ~57 units per week over the last 6 periods (P13-P18). Specifically, the last four weeks (P15-P18) showed 55, 57, 41, and 72 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 203, with 53 units in-transit (due next period from P15). Total pipeline inventory is 256. With current demand around 57/week, we have over 4 weeks of cover on-hand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering as we move past the early summer peak. This conservative 'recent_N' approach will help reduce ending inventory and holding costs while still maintaining a safe buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level following the April/May peak: average demand is ~57 units/week over P13-P18, down from the previous ~100 units/week average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observed a significant demand spike of 154 units on 2019-06-17. This deviates sharply from the previous seven-period average (~57 units). This is likely a mid-summer demand peak for a 'Vest top/V-neck top in woven fabric', which is a seasonal summer item. Period 20's date (2019-06-24) is right at the peak of summer in the northern hemisphere. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 15 order in Period 19. Inventory is currently sufficient (On-hand: 102, In-transit: 39) but the pipeline must be beefed up to handle this increased demand regime. I will shift mu_hat to reflect the recent spike by setting N=7 (capturing the transition from late May to the June peak) and using an explicit lead time of 4 to match the confirmed physical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 19: demand spiked to 154 units (previously averaged ~57 in P13-P18), likely representing a mid-summer seasonal peak for summer apparel.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712216001 (Women's Vest Top) is in its peak summer season (July 1st). Demand has surged significantly: Period 19 was 154 units and Period 20 reached 254 units, leading to a stockout. Previous 'summer peak' expectations were far too low. I must now adjust for a high-demand regime. Average demand over the last 2 weeks is 204 units. Given the seasonality of a spaghetti-strap vest top in July, high demand is expected to persist. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline contains 172 units (ordered in P19 and P20). Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of data (avg 204) to capture the current peak intensity, which results in a base stock level (for (L+1)=5 periods) aimed at recovering from the stockout and meeting the July demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: transition to peak summer demand for 'Vest top' SKU. Demand jumped from ~57 units (P13-P18) to an average of ~204 units (P19-P20), a +250% increase. Stockout occurred in Period 20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '712216001' (Womens Vest top) is currently in its peak summer season (July 2019). Demand has spiked significantly, confirmed by the 'Carry-over Insights' and recent history: P19=154, P20=254, P21=166. This is a regime shift from the spring average of ~57 units to a summer peak average of ~191 units (+235%). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts in P20 and P21. While the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, an order placed in P16 (which should have arrived in P20/P21) was 0 units, creating a supply gap. To recover and capture this high-profit summer demand ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for the new regime (5 weeks * 200 units/week = 1000) and increasing sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (166 to 254 range). This will signal the OR backend to place larger orders to refill the pipeline and cover the lead time + current period demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed for July: Average demand increased to ~191 units/week (P19-P21) from May/June average of ~57. High volatility observed during peak (range 154-254).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-July peak for a women's vest top. Historical data confirms a significant demand shift starting around Period 19 (mid-June), with demand average jumping from ~57 to ~191 units/week (P19-P21). Current inventory is 0 with a massive stockout since P20. However, a lead time crisis has emerged. While promised lead time is 4 periods, orders from P17 and P18 did not arrive as expected in P21 and P22 (arrived=0). This suggests either extended lead times (possibly 6+ periods) or lost shipments. Because the in-transit inventory is very high (841 units), including orders of 133, 321, and 348 placed in P20-P22, we must wait for these arrivals to avoid extreme overstocking if the delay is temporary. I am setting L to 6 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I'll use the recent summer peak average (approx 170 including the latest sample) over (L+1)=7 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability detected at Period 23: Orders from P17 and P18 (due P21, P22) have not arrived, suggesting lead time has increased to at least 6 periods or shipments are lost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July, witnessing a summer peak demand for 'Vest tops'. Demand has been highly volatile but significantly elevated compared to May/June. While the Period 19 order (39 units) arrived in Period 23 as expected (LT=4), orders from Periods 16 (0 units), 17 (0 units), and 18 (0 units) did arrive but were zero. Crucially, the orders from Period 20 (133 units), 21 (321 units), and 22 (348 units) are currently 'In-transit'. However, since the P19 order arrived on time, the fear of lost shipments from P17/P18 is resolved\u2014they were simply zero orders. Recent demand (P19-P23) averages ~161 units (154, 254, 166, 109, 122). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current peak regime. Given the stockouts and high volatility during the summer peak, a slight increase in L to 5 periods is prudent to account for potential delivery jitter during high-volume months, ensuring the base stock level is robust enough to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (July) averaging ~161 units/week (P19-P23), significantly higher than the May/June low of ~57 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for 'Vest tops' (late July). Demand has been high, with the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 166.2 units. Although Period 23 saw a significant dip (122), Period 24 returned to 180 units. Lead-time reconciliation: Period 23 conclude confirmed the P19 order arrived in 4 periods. Period 24 conclude confirmed the P20 order arrived in 4 periods. This invalidates the earlier suspicion of lost shipments/lead-time shifts (P16, P17, P18 orders were 0 units, which explains why no 'arrived' messages appeared in P21/P22). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 0, but in-transit is a massive 951 units (P21, P22, P23, P24 orders). We are currently in a stockout state but expect large arrivals starting next period. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the peak summer regime (avg ~166) and default lead time parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods (P19 and P20 orders arrived exactly after 4 periods: P23 and P24). Apparent delays in P21-P22 were due to zero-unit orders in P17-P18.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a 'Vest top', which has just passed its peak summer demand (July). Demand in Period 25 dropped to 112 units, down from the peak highs of 154-254. However, the last 5 periods (P21-P25) show an average demand of approximately 138 units, which is a safer estimate than the full peak average. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P21 order in P25. Current on-hand is 209, with a substantial 630 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the stockout phase in early July). Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 839) is very high compared to expected demand over the lead time (approx 5 periods * 138 = 690), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using a 5-period window to capture the deceleration from the absolute peak, while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that respects recent volatility but recognizes the cooling demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from July peak: average demand P21-P25 is ~138 units/week, down from late-June/early-July highs. Inventory position is currently high (839 units) relative to recent demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '712216001' (Womens Vest Top) is transitioning out of its peak summer demand regime (July). Current date is August 12. Period 26 demand was 83 units, continuing a downward trend from the July highs (which peaked at 254). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is approximately 125 units, significantly lower than the P20-P23 peak average of ~180. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P25 and P26. We are currently carrying a high on-hand inventory (474 units) plus in-transit stock (282 units from P23-P24 orders), totaling 756 units of pipeline inventory. Given the cooling seasonal demand for a summer vest top, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture the declining mean and volatility, preventing over-ordering as we exit the peak season. The current inventory position is likely sufficient for the next 4-5 weeks, so parameters will target a normalization of stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed for August: average demand decreased from ~160 (July) to ~125 units/week in late July/early August (P24-P26). Peak summer regime for 'Vest top' is ending.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top', which is seasonally dependent. We have clearly exited the July summer peak (where demand reached ~254 units) and have entered a cooling phase in August. The last three periods of demand (P25-P27) are 112, 83, and 56 units, showing a sharp downward trend as the summer season ends. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is very high at 689 units, which is enough to cover over 10 weeks of current demand levels (avg ~83). Consequently, the OR backend needs to stop ordering to allow inventory to deplete. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the rapidly declining late-summer demand (mean ~107), which will result in a lower base stock and prevent further accumulation of units that would incur high holding costs ($1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: August cooling trend for 'Vest top'. Demand dropped from ~160 (July avg) to 56 units by P27. Inventory is in a significant surplus position (689 units on-hand).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '712216001' (Womens Vest Top) is entering late August (2019-08-26), confirming the end of the summer peak season. Demand has significantly cooled, dropping from a July peak average of ~160 to an average of ~63 units over the last three periods (P26-P28: 83, 56, 59). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, there is a substantial inventory surplus with 641 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. Given a potential demand regime of ~60 units/week, the current stock covers over 10 periods of supply, which is far beyond the (L+1=5) period target. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this lower late-summer demand regime and use the default lead time. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high on-hand balance relative to the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand for late August (P26-P28) has stabilized at ~66 units/week, down from the July peak of ~160 units. Current inventory (641 units) and incoming pipeline significantly exceed short-term demand forecasts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. The product is a 'Vest top', which is a seasonal summer garment. We have clearly exited the summer peak (July/August) and entered a low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is approximately 63 units/week (83, 56, 59, 54), compared to the July peak of ~160. Inventory is currently extremely high at 587 units on-hand, which covers nearly 9 weeks of current demand. With a lead time of 4 periods and a service level target, we are currently in a heavy overstock position. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same recent period to reflect lower volatility in this regime. L remains at the stable promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized at ~60 units/week (P26-P29 average is 63) as of September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU '712216001' (Vest top) has exited its summer peak (which reached ~160 units/week in July) and has transitioned into a stable post-summer regime. Over the last four periods (P27-P30), demand has stayed low and relatively stable, averaging approximately 52 units per week (56, 59, 54, 38). Our current on-hand inventory is 549 units, which is extremely high (covering over 10 weeks of demand at the current rate). No orders are currently in transit, which is appropriate given the massive inventory surplus. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5 samples (capturing the cooling trend and the new baseline) and continue using the default lead time of 4, as the logic will correctly output zero orders until the on-hand inventory is depleted to safer levels. This approach prioritizes reducing holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for 'Vest top' confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~51 units/week (P27-P30) following the July peak. Inventory levels are significantly elevated (549 units) relative to current throughput.

As of September 16, demand has significantly decelerated from the July peak (~160 units/week) to a low-volume stable regime. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), demand has been 59, 54, 38, and 26 units respectively, averaging approximately 44 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 523 units, which represents roughly 12 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. With a lead time of 4 periods and the game concluding in Period 47, the primary objective is to avoid incurring excessive holding costs on this surplus inventory while maintaining a minimal service buffer. No new orders are needed as the pipeline and on-hand stock are more than sufficient for the remainder of the season.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decay confirmed: demand dropped from ~60 units/week in late August to ~32 units/week in early September (P30-P31). Inventory remains in significant surplus (500+ units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712216001 (Womens Vest Top) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move further into September (P32). Demand has dropped from a July peak (~160 units/week) to an average of ~28 units/week over the last three periods (P30: 38, P31: 26, P32: 20). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 503 units, which represents approximately 18 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There is no pipeline inventory (in-transit is 0), and given the lead time of 4 periods, no further orders are needed for the foreseeable future. The objective is to minimize holding costs by allowing the on-hand inventory to deplete toward a level that matches the new, lower demand regime. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures this steep decline, while L=4 remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: average demand has fallen to ~28 units/week (P30-P32), significantly lower than the P27-P29 average of ~56 units. Inventory remains in a heavy surplus (500+ units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '712216001' (Womens Vest Top) is in a clear post-summer demand decline. The current date is September 30, and observed demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) has averaged 34.5 units/week, significantly lower than the July peak (~160) and the August transition (~60). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 449 units, which covers over 13 weeks of current demand. With no in-transit units and a stable lead time of 4 periods, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime and continue to allow the excess inventory to bleed down to avoid further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for 'Vest top' stabilized further at lower levels: average demand for September (P30-P33) is ~35 units/week, down from late August average of ~60 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October). The SKU is a 'Vest top', a summer-seasonal item. Demand has consistently stayed at a post-summer low, averaging ~32 units/week over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 38, 26, 20, 54, 22), with volatility significantly reduced. Current on-hand inventory is 427 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 13 weeks of supply\u2014well beyond the 5-week 'reach' (L+1) required for the base stock policy to even consider ordering. There is no pipeline inventory (In-transit: 0). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the shift to autumn, the priority is to bleed off existing excess inventory. I will set L to 4 (stable history) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the recent 5-period post-summer regime (N=5) to reflect current low demand. The OR backend will correctly calculate a base stock level far below current stock, resulting in a zero order to minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand for 'Vest top' has stabilized at a low-volume regime: average demand P30-P34 is ~32 units/week (+/- 14 units). Significant inventory surplus (400+ units) exists going into Q4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Vest top', which has finished its summer peak (July/August) and is now in a low-demand autumn regime. Recent demand (P31-P35) has been extremely low: 26, 20, 54, 22, 11 (average ~27 units/week). The inventory on-hand (416 units) is extremely high, covering over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P19-P24 orders). No new orders have been placed since P24 because the inventory position is far above any reasonable base stock level for this time of year. I will continue to set the OR parameters to reflect this low-demand, high-surplus environment, allowing the systems to bleed off the excess inventory before ordering again.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-volume regime confirmed for October: demand has dropped to an average of ~27 units/week (P31-P35) from the September average of ~35. Significant inventory surplus (400+ units) continues.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top', which is seasonally aligned with summer. We are now in late October, and demand has consistently fallen as the product enters its off-season. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged approximately 24 units/week, with the most recent two periods (P35-P36) dropping even further to 11 units each. There is a massive inventory surplus of 405 units on-hand, which at current demand rates represents over 15 weeks of supply. No further orders have been placed recently, and none are in transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the extreme inventory surplus, I will continue to signal the OR backend to minimize orders. Setting L=4 (promised), mu_hat to a recent average of the last 6 periods to reflect the low-volume regime, and sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility will help the backend maintain a low base stock, effectively preventing any new orders until the existing stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-volume regime for 'Vest top' deepened in October: average demand P34-P36 has dropped to ~15 units/week from the September average of ~35.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late autumn/winter. The product is a 'Vest top' (summer wear), which is in a deep low-volume regime. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) being approximately 15 units/week. Inventory is currently at 389 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 25 weeks of current demand. Given the seasonal nature of the product and the high holding costs relative to current sales velocity, no new orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-period window to reflect this late-season low demand, while maintaining the lead time at the default (4). The backend capped policy will naturally result in zero orders due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-volume regime for 'Vest top' confirmed: demand average for October (P34-P37) has dropped to ~15 units/week. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (380+ units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top (Womens Everyday Collection)', which has completed its primary summer seasonal cycle. Historically, demand for this item peaked in July (averaging ~160 units/week) and has steadily declined through autumn. In October (Periods 34-38), demand further stabilized at a low-volume regime of approximately 15.6 units/week (range 11-22). The inventory position is currently 369 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the service level requirements (Profit $4 / Holding $1), a base stock covering (L+1) periods is needed. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~16 units, target inventory would be ~80 units. Since current on-hand (369) is more than 4x the required base stock, I will continue to order 0 units to reduce holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-volume October/November regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top', which is a highly seasonal summer item. We are currently in a deep post-summer low-volume regime. Demand has fallen from a July peak of ~160 units/week to an October/November average of approximately 14 units/week (P36-P39: 11, 16, 20, 8). Despite zero orders since Period 24, we still have an extreme overstock of 361 units on-hand. This inventory is sufficient to cover over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate (361 / 14 \u2248 25 weeks). Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to be explicit and very low to reflect this seasonal decay and prevent the OR engine from ordering against historical highs. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-volume regime for 'Vest top' continues into November: average demand P36-P39 has dropped to ~14 units/week. Inventory surplus (360+ units) is extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, and the SKU is a 'Vest top', which is a highly seasonal summer product. Analysis of the demand history shows a massive peak in July (reaching 254 units), followed by a steady decline through autumn. In the most recent period (P40), demand dropped to a new low of 5 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 12 units/week. On-hand inventory is 356 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at covering a (1+L) = 5 week window. Current inventory (356 units) covers approximately 29 weeks of demand at the current rate (~12 units/week), far exceeding the 5-week requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-volume post-summer regime using the most recent 10 samples to capture the stabilization after the October drop, while keeping L at the default promised lead time as recent arrivals (through P28) confirmed it was stable.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-volume regime for 'Vest top' deepened in November: average demand P36-P40 has dropped to ~12 units/week. Inventory surplus (350+ units) remains extremely high for the end-of-year period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top', which is seasonally relevant for summer but sees very low demand in winter. We are currently in a low-volume demand regime that has persisted since October. In the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been extremely low: 16, 20, 8, 5, 10 (mean = 11.8). The inventory on-hand is 346 units, which at the current burn rate of ~12 units/week, represents nearly 29 weeks of stock. Since there are only 6 periods remaining in the simulation and no incoming pipeline, the priority is to avoid any further orders to minimize holding costs. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat) based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current low-volume reality, and keep lead time at the default promised value of 4 periods as observed in history. No ordering will occur because base_stock will be significantly lower than the current inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). The SKU (Vest top) is a seasonal summer item currently in its low-volume post-summer phase. In Period 42, demand spiked to 41 units, likely due to a Black Friday or early December promotion, interrupting the previous November average of ~10 units. However, on-hand inventory remains very high at 305 units, which is approximately 7.4 times the recent demand spike and even higher relative to the base low-volume regime. No new orders are needed (in-transit is 0, on-hand is 305). I will set L to 'default' as lead time has stabilized at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (P38-P42) to capture the recent regime which includes the December spike, ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR backend remains realistic while the system continues to burn through existing surplus. No ordering is expected due to the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike to 41 units in Period 42 (late Nov/early Dec), deviating from the ~12 unit/week November average.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th. We are managing a 'Vest top' (summer-seasonal SKU). Demand has recently shown a small uptick in late November/early December (Period 42: 41 units, Period 43: 28 units), likely due to holiday sales or clearance, compared to the November average of ~12 units/week. However, the inventory on-hand (277 units) remains extremely high\u2014representing over 9 weeks of coverage even at the spiked demand level of ~30 units/week. Because the on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the base stock level required for a 4-period lead time, the OR backend will continue to produce zero-unit orders regardless of the specific parameters. I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast to capture the slight holiday increase while maintaining the default lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick detected in late Nov/early Dec: Period 42-43 average demand is ~35 units/week, up from the November average of ~12 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the final periods of the game (P45 of 47). The SKU is a 'Vest top', which is seasonally a summer item. While we saw a small demand uptick in late November/early December (P42=41, P43=28), Period 44 demand dropped sharply back to 3 units. On-hand inventory is 274 units, which is extremely high (roughly 10x the recent average demand of 24 units/week from P42-P44, or over 20x the November average of ~12). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive after the game ends. Therefore, the primary objective is to liquidate the existing surplus and minimize holding costs. I will set the mean and volatility parameters to reflect the recent holiday uptick to ensure the backend recognizes the demand, but because on-hand exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the system will naturally order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Demand peaked at 41 units in P42 but dropped to 3 units by P44, indicating a short-lived or inconsistent late-season spike for this summer-category SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). The product is a 'Vest top', a summer-seasonal item. Demand late in the year has been low and volatile: Period 42-45 demands were 41, 28, 3, and 56. Despite a surprise spike to 56 last period, the overall average since Period 40 (November/December) is approximately 25 units/week. Inventory is currently at 218 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, our current on-hand inventory covers over 8 weeks of demand at the recent average rate (218 / 25 = 8.7 periods). Since our inventory position is already more than double the (L+1) requirement for the current low-demand regime, I will continue to order zero units to reduce holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect the recent baseline demand of ~25 units/week with moderate volatility (sigma_hat=15).

Carry-over insight: Late-season (Dec) volatility confirmed: demand fluctuated between 3 and 56 units/week (P42-P45), averaging 32 units/week, significantly higher than the November average of 12.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are analyzing a 'Vest top', which is a summer-seasonal SKU. Currently, the demand has been volatile through December (average ~32 units/week over P42-P46), representing a minor holiday uptick compared to the November average of ~12 units. However, as it is the end of December, this holiday lift is expected to subside as we enter January. The on-hand inventory is 189 units, which covers approximately 6 weeks of demand at the recent holiday average and over 15 weeks at the base November average. Since there are 0 units in-transit and the promised lead time is 4, we have a total pipeline of 189 units. The OR backend uses a service level logic based on profit/holding cost, but Given the heavy surplus remaining from the summer peak and the expected post-holiday drop in demand for women's vest tops, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent December volatility while ensuring the base stock level remains well below the current on-hand inventory to prevent unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility peak (Dec): Demand averaged ~32 units/week (P42-P46) with a range of [3, 56], up from the November low-volume baseline of ~12.
