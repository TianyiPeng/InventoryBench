Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Nora T-shirt. Historical data shows demand samples of 30, 27, 70, 72, and 56. There is a visible demand shift between the second and third samples (increasing from ~28 to ~71), suggesting a recent regime shift toward higher volume. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which typically sees steady demand but can increase as we approach spring/warmer weather in February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed history of actual lead times yet, I will use 'default' for L. For \u03bc\u0302 (mean demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher volume observed in the most recent samples (70, 72, 56) which averages 66 per period, as opposed to the total average of ~51. Since the OR engine calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, this will provide a base stock reflecting the current higher trend. For \u03c3\u0302 (standard deviation), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's jersey basic T-shirt, which is a staple item. Initial demand observations (seed data plus Period 1) show a range between 27 and 72 units. Seed data: 30, 27, 70, 72, 56 (Average ~51). Period 1 demand was 70. Current on-hand is 0, with 81 units in-transit (ordered in P1). Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order will arrive during Period 5 (visibility in P6). Therefore, we must cover at least 5 periods of demand (L+1) from P2 through P6. The recent demand (last 3 samples: 72, 56, 70) suggests a higher mean (avg 66) than the full history. I will use recent_N to capture this current trend. Since we have no actual lead time confirmation yet, I will stick to the default promised lead time. Sigma will be handled by recent_N to account for the current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. Looking at the demand history, we saw a significant jump from early February (avg ~50) to the last two periods (70 and 136). The jump to 136 suggests a seasonal shift as we approach spring, or a structural demand change. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 162 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the P1 order (81 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Since we have no actual arrival data yet to contradict the promised lead time, I will stick with the default L. Given the recent spike in demand (136 is nearly double the previous average), I will use the last 3 samples (56, 70, 136) to calculate mu_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures this upward trend for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 3 samples to account for the increased volatility seen in the 136-unit demand period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is showing a significant demand increase compared to the initial historical samples. The average demand across the first three periods of execution (70, 136, 111) is 105.7, which is roughly double the pre-launch average (~50). This suggests a demand regime shift likely linked to the product's classification as 'Womens Everyday Basics' and early spring seasonality (February/March). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 (81 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. Total in-transit is 320 units (81 + 81 + 158). Given the spike, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this higher mean and volatility. L is kept at 'default' (4) as no orders have arrived yet to confirm actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~106 (+112%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a Nora T-shirt, a basic women's staple. Since 2019-02-11 (Period 1), demand has shifted from an average of ~51 to ~102 (+100% increase), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 6's start message. Therefore, current zero on-hand inventory is expected. The total in-transit quantity (481 units) covers the orders from P1-P4 (81+81+158+161). To manage the new demand regime, I will use a recent_N method (N=4) to capture the higher mean (~102) and higher volatility observed in the last 4 weeks. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand window (approx 510 units total) allowing the system to fulfill demand once the pipeline begins to arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's T-shirt, which is showing a sustained demand increase as we move into spring. The Carry-over insight correctly identified a demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical samples (30, 27, 70, 72, 56) represent the old regime, while the observed demand from Periods 1 to 5 (70, 136, 111, 92, 70) represents the new regime. The mean of the new regime is approximately 95.8 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). Our current on-hand inventory is low (11 units) due to the zero-inventory state in preceding periods. There is a significant pipeline of 431 units. To avoid over-ordering while maintaining the base stock to cover (L+1) periods (5 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period regime (95.8 * 5 \u2248 479) and keep sigma_hat at recent levels to capture the higher volatility seen in the new regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The carry-over insight correctly identified a demand regime shift around mid-February. Demand since Period 1 has averaged approximately 94.5 units per week (70, 136, 111, 92, 70, 88), which is significantly higher than the initial pre-period samples (avg ~51). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt, which sees increasing demand as spring progresses. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) due to high demand and slow replenishment. Total in-transit is 387 units (from P3-P6), with 158 units expected to arrive during Period 7 resolution. To set OR parameters, L=4 (promised and confirmed). For mu_hat, N=6 covers the current high-demand regime (avg = 94.5), so (1+4)*94.5 = 472.5. For sigma_hat, calculating the standard deviation of the last 6 periods (~24.5), resulting in sqrt(5)*24.5 \u2248 54.8. These parameters will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the increased demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived at P5 and P6). Demand regime remains stable at new higher level (avg ~95/week) since Feb 11.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The 'Nora T-shirt' is a generic t-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand has shifted significantly since mid-February (Period 1), increasing from a pre-game average of ~51 to a game average of ~101.6. In the last three periods, demand has been 92, 88, and 144 (avg 108). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals from P1, P2, and P3. On-hand inventory is low (18), but substantial stock is in-transit (311), including an order of 161 (placed P4) that should arrive in the next period's arrival phase (Period 8 conclude). To account for the stable high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of the game where the regime shift occurred. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times match the promised lead time of 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a higher demand regime that began around mid-February (Period 1/2019-02-11). Over the last 8 periods, the average demand has settled at approximately 112 units per week (min 70, max 144), significantly higher than the initial pre-February baseline. The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, we have 35 units on hand and 301 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~560 units total coverage). Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the observed lead times are consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at a higher mean of ~112 units/week (Periods 1-8). Seasonality for 'Everyday Basics' jersey products is contributing to sustained high volume through spring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically enters peak demand during the spring season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: pre-Period 1 demand averaged ~51, while Period 1 to Period 9 demand has averaged approximately 110 units/week (70, 136, 111, 92, 70, 88, 144, 144, 136). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. In Period 9, demand (136) exceeded starting inventory (66), resulting in 70 units of lost sales and an ending on-hand inventory of 0. Currently, 429 units are in transit, including orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9. Based on the 4-period lead time, the Period 6 order (37 units) is expected to arrive in Period 10. To address the confirmed high demand and the recent stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the higher mean (~110) since the regime shift, and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=9) to account for the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Recent demand (last 4 periods: 144, 144, 136, 147) shows a significant increase from the initial post-shift average, now averaging ~143 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because arrivals in Periods 9 (31 units) and 10 (37 units) were significantly lower than current demand, leading to stockouts. Higher orders placed in Periods 7 (82) and 8 (151) are expected to arrive in Periods 11 and 12 respectively. To address the current stockout and the elevated demand level, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this latest high-demand regime (Mean ~143, Std Dev ~5). The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~715 units). With 514 already in transit, this will trigger necessary replenishment to match the current 140+ demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Average demand increased again from ~112 to ~143 (+27%) over the last 4 periods (April seasonality).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Nora T-shirt) is experiencing high demand due to spring seasonality, with a significant spike to 212 units in Period 11. Historical demand since mid-February has evolved through regimes of ~106 and ~143 units/week. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) due to stockouts in the last three periods, where arrivals (31, 37, 82) were insufficient to meet demand (136, 147, 212). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the 'Everyday Basics' category and late April date, demand is expected to remain high but volatile. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent escalations (avg ~160) and use recent_N for sigma to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation has increased significantly with the 212 unit peak). This aggressive setting encourages the OR backend to place larger orders to recover from the stockout state and provide a higher service level for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 11 with a peak of 212 units, suggesting that previous mean estimates (~143) may still be conservative for the spring peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is experiencing a significant demand surge throughout April and early May, characteristic of spring seasonality. Demand in the last two periods (P11 and P12) reached 212 and 188 units, respectively, significantly higher than the early-year average. Despite consistent lead times of 4 periods, stockouts occurred in the last four periods (P9-P12) due to under-forecasting this sharp uptick. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand averaging ~170 units over the last 4 weeks (recent_N=4), the inventory goal must protect against both the high mean and increased volatility. I am setting L to default (4) as lead times remain stable. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the high spring demand regime (avg 170.75), and sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to account for the recent spike in volatility (std ~34). This results in a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for Period 12: Late April/Early May demand has surged to an average of ~170 units (up from ~112 in early Spring), driven by seasonal transition. The system has suffered consecutive stockouts (P9-P12) due to this accelerated growth.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the item (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a high-demand seasonal phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 163 units ([136+147+212+188+132]/5), confirming the 'carry_over_insight' of a sustained shift. The previous periods saw multiple stockouts (P9-P12), but P13 ending inventory of 27 units shows we are starting to catch up with supply. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 captures the recent high-volume regime (avg 163/week * 5 = 815). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen in P11 (212 units) and P12 (188 units), ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation protects against further stockouts during this peak spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~163 units/week (last 5 periods) following the April/May surge. Supply lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Inventory bottleneck has started to clear as of P13 conclude.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', which has experienced a significant demand surge throughout the spring. While Period 14 showed another stockout (ending on-hand 0), this was a very close call (demand 154 vs starting on-hand 149), and the supply pipeline is finally catching up. The demand regime over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged ~166 units (147, 212, 188, 132, 154). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning our base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and volatility to reflect the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock and order cap are calculated based on the 160-170 unit/week volume rather than the lower historical averages from early spring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which sees high demand during the transition to summer (late May). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) shows a high mean demand of 175.8 units/week (212, 188, 132, 154, 193), suggesting the demand regime has stabilized at this elevated level, though volatility remains high (std ~30). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) as demand (193) exceeded arrivals (151) in P15. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (base_stock = median demand over L+1). Given current pipelines (P12-P15 orders total 682 units) and the 4-period lead time, we need to ensure the base stock calculation covers 5 periods of demand (~879 units). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the high spring demand regime) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~176 units/week over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), reflecting peak spring/pre-summer seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the product 'Nora T-shirt' continues to experience high seasonal demand typical of early summer. Recent demand history shows a sustained high-volume regime: the last 5 periods (P12-P16) have seen demands of 188, 132, 154, 193, and 223, averaging approx. 178 units/week. This supports the carry-over insight from P16 of an average around 176 units. Although the backend uses a profit/holding cost ratio to determine service levels, the equal weighting ($1.00 each) results in a target service level of 50%, which may be too low given the frequent stockouts observed (P14-P16 ending inventory = 0). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent peak demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the latest conclude messages (P13-P16).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in high-summer regime: Average demand for Periods 12-16 is 178 units/week, consistent with previous observations of ~176. Inventory continues to stock out (0 on-hand) despite arrivals, indicating demand is still outpacing the OR engine's conservative targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is currently experiencing its peak summer season (June 17). Demand remains high with recent samples from Period 15-18 being 193, 223, 218, and 142. Although demand dropped to 142 in Period 18, this likely reflects a temporary fluctuation or stockout-constrained observation rather than a true regime shift, as the product is an 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt suited for hot weather. The system has suffered from chronic stockouts (Ending On-hand=0 for Periods 14-18), meaning true demand is likely higher than sold units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero current inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high-regime average of approximately 184 units/week (Periods 14-18) across the (L+1) window. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for sustained summer volume and provides safety against the current volatility (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: Average demand for Periods 14-18 is approximately 184 units/week, despite recurring stockouts limit observed sales.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is currently in its peak summer demand regime. We are in Period 20 (late June). Demand remains high, consistently outstripping supply as evidenced by consecutive stockouts (zero ending inventory in 9 of the last 10 periods). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 193.2 units, which is significantly higher than earlier regimes. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently selling out of everything that arrives, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this sustained high Summer demand peak of ~193 per week. Given the volatility (peaks of 223) and continuous stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the high variance observed during this peak season, encouraging the OR engine to maintain a higher buffer.

Carry-over insight: Peak Summer demand regime sustained into late June: Average demand for Period 15-19 is ~193 units/week. Frequent stockouts continue to cap observed sales, suggesting actual demand potentially exceeds 200 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which remains in high demand during the peak summer season. Observed demand for Period 20 was 190 units, and the average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 191 units per week. Despite frequent stockouts limiting our visibility into true market demand, the trend has stabilized at this high level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 order arriving in P20). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this sustained summer demand regime (~191/week). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the high volatility (fluctuations between 142 and 223) observed in recent periods. This approach will set a base stock level that targets covering (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand at the current high-velocity rate, accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed across June/early July: Average demand for Period 16-20 is ~191 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), we are transitioning from peak summer demand. The last period (P21) showed a significant drop in demand to 104 units, compared to the previously sustained levels of ~190-200 units during June. Since this is a basic jersey T-shirt, we are likely seeing the start of a late-summer seasonal decline or a correction from saturated demand. Additionally, we finally have on-hand inventory (130 units) and a large pipeline (729 units) which are now sufficient given the lower observed demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am adjusting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to better catch the potential downward trend while still accounting for the high levels of the previous few weeks. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (5) to capture the recent volatility increase (190 vs 104).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21: Observed demand dropped to 104 units from a June average of ~191 (-45%), suggesting a transition out of the peak summer season.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt has clearly transitioned out of its summer peak. In Period 22, demand was 79 units, following 104 units in Period 21, which is a significant drop from the 190+ units observed in June. This aligns with mid-July seasonality as 'Everyday Basics' transition from high-summer volume towards late-summer/pre-fall levels. The mean demand for the last 2 periods is 91.5 units, down from the June average of ~191. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the last two post-peak periods plus the last peak period to avoid over-correcting too abruptly while acknowledging the downward trend). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory has finally recovered (51 units), and there are significant units in-transit (729). Moving to a smaller N for mu_hat will allow the OR engine to scale back orders and avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Summer peak has ended. Demand dropped from ~191 (June avg) to ~92 (Period 21-22 avg), a decrease of ~52%.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (avg ~191 units) into a significantly lower regime. Demand for the last three periods (P21-23) has been 104, 79, and 88, averaging approximately 90 units per week. This represents a ~53% drop from the June peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels are currently high (210 on-hand + 482 in-transit), which is significantly above the required base stock for this new demand level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp drop in demand and prevent further excess ordering while holding costs accumulate. The OR backend needs to realize that the pipeline is currently over-saturated for a 90-unit/week demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-summer level: Average demand for Periods 21-23 is ~90 units/week (-53% from summer peak).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt has clearly transitioned out of the peak summer season as of early July. Since Period 21, demand has dropped significantly from an average of ~191 units/week to a current average of ~83 units/week over the last four periods (Period 21: 104, Period 22: 79, Period 23: 88, Period 24: 61). We are currently in clear surplus, with 396 units on-hand and an additional 235 units in-transit (ordered Period 21). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be very close to the expected mean demand over the lead time (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this lower late-summer/early-fall demand regime. Setting L to default (4) as lead times have been consistent, though we must watch for the impact of the zero-order from Period 18 which resolved in Period 22.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has clearly entered a post-summer cooling phase. Since Period 21 (July 1st), weekly demand has dropped significantly from the June peak of ~191 to an average of ~75.2 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25: 104, 79, 88, 61, 44). The latest observed demand of 44 suggests the decline is continuing as we enter August. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (587) with zero in-transit, as previous large orders placed during the summer peak have arrived. My objective is to prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime. The high on-hand inventory will correctly trigger the OR backend to place zero orders, which is appropriate given the current stock levels relative to the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed starting Period 21: Average demand dropped from ~191 (June) to ~75 (Periods 21-25), with the most recent sample at 44 units, signaling the end of summer peak seasonality.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt has clearly transitioned out of the Summer peak. Since Period 21 (early July), demand has dropped significantly from a June average of ~191 to a recent average of ~74 units/week (last 6 periods). The most recent demand samples are 104, 79, 88, 61, 44, and 66. Current on-hand inventory is high at 521 units, which is more than sufficient to cover projected demand for the next 4-5 periods (L+1). No new units are currently in transit as orders were paused starting Period 22 to mitigate overstock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the current inventory surplus, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime and allow the OR engine to wind down inventory naturally without placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~74 units/week since Period 21, a 60% reduction from June levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt remains in its post-summer stabilization phase. Since Period 21, the market has transitioned out of the high-demand summer peak (which averaged ~190 units/week) into a significantly lower regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) is approximately 70.8 units/week. The most recent sample (P27) was 50 units. We are currently holding 471 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 6 weeks of supply at current demand levels. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 7-period average (~71 units/week * 5 periods = 355) and maintaining recent_N for volatility. This will result in zero orders being placed by the OR backend until on-hand inventory depletes to a level safer for the current demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (which averaged ~191 units/week) into a much lower late-summer/early-fall regime. Since Period 21, demand has averaged ~66 units/week, with the most recent four periods (P25-P28) showing a further decline to an average of 49.75 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 432 units, which is more than sufficient to cover multiple periods of current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs and allow existing stock to deplete, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using recent_N=8 to capture the post-peak downward trend specifically (Periods 21-28).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 25: Mean demand has further declined to ~50 units/week, suggesting a stable late-summer baseline significantly below the previous ~191 peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has transitioned from its high-summer peak (approx. 190 units/week) into a low-volume late-summer/early-autumn regime. Demand has steadily declined over the last five periods (66, 50, 39, 18), settling at an average of approximately 43 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 414 units with 0 units in transit. Given the low current demand and high inventory, the system is significantly overstocked relative to expected demand for the (L+1) horizon. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent lower-demand regime while allowing the backend to work through the excess inventory without placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Mean demand has declined to ~43 units/week (last 5 periods) as the product moves into the autumn season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Nora T-shirt) is in a clear post-summer decline, entering the autumn season. Demand has trended downwards from a June peak of ~191 units/week to a recent 5-period average (Periods 26-30) of 37.8 units/week. The most recent demand samples are 18 and 16 units, suggesting the current inventory of 398 units is extremely high (nearly 10 weeks of coverage even at the higher 40-unit average). No orders have been placed since Period 21 to allow this excess to bleed off. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to continue setting parameters based on the most recent low-demand regime to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while we carry high holding costs on the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn baseline: Average demand for Periods 26-30 is ~38 units/week, with the most recent two weeks slowing to <20 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is clearly in a deep end-of-season decline. As of September 16, 2019 (Period 32), demand has plummeted from summer peaks (~191) to an average of ~20 units/week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 50, 39, 18, 16, 3), with the most recent week at just 3 units. On-hand inventory is 395 units, which covers nearly 20 weeks of demand at the current average rate. With lead time stable at 4 periods, no further orders are required. To prevent any automated ordering from the OR backend (which might still be influenced by historical high-demand samples), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to accurately reflect the autumn baseline and keeping L at 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 4-period delivery observed throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 28: Autumn demand has reached a low baseline of ~20 units/week (last 5 periods average: 25.2), with the most recent sample dropping to 3 units, requiring zero new orders due to high existing stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the low-demand autumn season, with demand dropping significantly from summer peaks of ~190 units/week to a current 5-period average of ~16.6 units/week (Periods 28-32). The most recent demand samples (3 and 7 units) confirm a very low baseline. We currently have 388 units on-hand and zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, this inventory is sufficient to cover nearly 20 weeks of demand at the current rate (388 / ~18). To minimize holding costs while the backend computes base stocks, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime and avoid unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-autumn low: Average demand for Periods 28-32 is ~17 units/week, down from ~38 in the previous month.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 29-33) is 13.2 units/week, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~190 units. The current on-hand inventory is 366 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 27 weeks of supply. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit/period (equal to the profit margin), maintaining this level of excess inventory is extremely costly. No new orders are needed for the foreseeable future. I will set the demand parameters using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this low-demand state, while the lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable low-demand regime characteristic of the autumn/winter season. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34) has dropped significantly to approximately 11.4 units per week, compared to the peak summer demand of ~191 units. Specifically, the last few weeks recorded demands of 16, 3, 7, 22, and 9. With an current on-hand inventory of 357 units and zero units in transit, the inventory position is extremely high relative to current demand (covering approximately 31 weeks of stock at the current rate). No new orders are needed; however, to prevent the OR engine from attempting to order due to historical averages, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the low autumn baseline. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak into a low-demand autumn/winter baseline. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) being approximately 9.4 units per week. The inventory on-hand is currently 351 units, which at the current demand rate, covers over 37 weeks of supply. Given that the total periods in the game are 47 and we are at Period 36, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand until the end of the simulation. No further orders are required. I will set the demand parameters using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the reduced need for stock, while the existing inventory naturally depletes, minimizing further holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which experienced a significant demand peak during the summer (June/July) and has since entered a low-demand autumn/winter regime. Since Period 31, weekly demand has consistently remained below 10 units, with an average of approximately 8.5 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). The current on-hand inventory is 343 units, which at the current demand rate, covers over 40 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR engine from triggering an order due to high historical variance or seasonal averages, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the current stabilized low-demand baseline. Lead time (L) remains at the confirmed default of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-autumn/early-winter low: Average demand for Periods 32-36 is ~8.5 units/week, down from ~17 in the previous month. Inventory levels are extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer demand for the Nora T-shirt has stabilized at a very low late-autumn level, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) being approximately 9.6 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 340 units, which covers over 35 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the low profit margin ($1.0/unit), maintaining excess stock is detrimental to the total reward. No new orders have been placed since Period 21, and the pipeline is empty. I will continue to set parameters that result in zero orders until the inventory level aligns with the current demand regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a sustained late-autumn/early-winter low demand regime. As of Period 39 (early November), current on-hand inventory is 332 units, which is extremely high relative to the current average demand of ~8.5 units per week observed over the last month (Periods 34-38: 9, 6, 8, 3, 8). At this rate, the existing stock covers over 30 weeks of demand, well beyond the remaining 8 periods of the simulation. No new orders are needed. I will maintain parameters that reflect this low-demand baseline to prevent the OR engine from generating unnecessary orders, as the priority is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering mid-November (Period 40), a period typically characterized by low demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts as winter approaches. Historical demand has consistently declined throughout autumn, with the average over the last 12 periods (P28-P39) being approximately 9.3 units per week. The most recent demand sample was 7 units. Current inventory on-hand is extremely high at 325 units, which covers over 30 weeks of demand at the current average rate. With 0 units in-transit and a promised lead time of 4 periods, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this low-demand autumn/winter baseline, and L=default (4). The high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculation will result in zero orders, effectively minimizing holding costs while maintaining a buffer against any small winter surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at winter low: Average demand for Periods 32-39 is ~7.5 units/week. Significant inventory surplus (325 units) necessitates zero ordering for the foreseeable future.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep winter demand trough. Since the significant drop-off in demand that began around Period 21 (July), demand has stabilized at a very low level. For the last 5 periods (Periods 36-40), demand has averaged 6.6 units per week (8, 3, 8, 7, 7). Current on-hand inventory is 318 units, which, at the current average demand rate, represents nearly 48 weeks of stock. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a service level of 50%. Given the massive inventory surplus and the low-demand winter season, the objective is to avoid any new orders and minimize holding costs until the inventory level naturally depletes. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current winter baseline, which will result in a base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, ensuring zero new orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep winter low-demand regime, typical for a basic jersey T-shirt in late November. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 6.6 units/week, and over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 8.5 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 310 units, which covers more than 35 weeks of demand at current rates. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, requiring on-hand inventory to match lead-time demand. Since we have a massive surplus relative to the current forecast (mu_hat ~35-42 units for L=4), no new orders are necessary. I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this stable, low-volume baseline accurately and minimize further holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable winter low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 9.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 295 units, which provides over 30 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate, well beyond the remainder of the game (4 periods left). With a holding cost of $1.0/unit and profit of $1.0/unit, the priority remains minimizing holding costs by avoiding any further replenishment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to reflect the current low-volume reality, ensuring the base stock calculation stays below the massive inventory level to prevent additional ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' is a jersey t-shirt currently in a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand has stabilized significantly, with an average of approximately 7.8 units per week over the last 12 periods (Periods 32-43). The current inventory on hand is 293 units, while no units are in transit. Given the current average demand, the existing stock is sufficient to cover approximately 37 weeks, which far exceeds the remaining 4 periods of the simulation. Therefore, any additional orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to satisfied demand. I will maintain parameters that result in a zero-order recommendation from the OR backend. I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect this stable winter baseline and 'default' for lead time as it remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a very low-demand winter baseline regime. Since Period 32 (September/October), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 7.5 units per week, with recent samples (Periods 40-44) being 7, 8, 15, 2, and 5 units respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 288 units, which covers over 38 weeks of demand at the current average. Given the remaining game duration consists of only 2 periods (up to period 47), no additional inventory is needed. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering the period since early October when demand settled into the <10 units/week range) to set the baseline and variance, which will result in a zero order given the significant inventory surplus.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep winter low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is approximately 6.9 units/week. With on-hand inventory at 282 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers over 40 weeks of demand at the present rate. The goal remains to liquidate this surplus without incurring further holding costs. Given the current date (2019/12/23), there is no evidence of an impending spring surge yet, which historically didn't start until mid-February. L is set to 'default' as lead time has been stable, while mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the sustained low-demand winter period. No new orders will be generated by the OR backend because on-hand exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which experienced a significant demand peak during the spring and summer months (reaching ~200 units/week) and has since transitioned into a winter low. Currently, as of late December 2019 (Period 47), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 6 units/week over the last 10 periods (Periods 37-46). The most recent demand was 0. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 282 units, which represents nearly a year's worth of stock at the current consumption rate. With zero units in-transit and lead time stable at 4 periods, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime to reflect this winter baseline accurately, while keeping lead time at the default promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at winter floor: Average demand for Periods 37-46 is ~6.1 units/week. Significant inventory surplus (282 units) ensures no stockout risk for the remainder of the low season.
