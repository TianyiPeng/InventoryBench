Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a pair of ladies' denim trousers (Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W), which is a staple fashion item with likely seasonal demand. Looking at the limited historical data (5 weeks), demand started at 0 and grew rapidly to 277 units in the most recent week (2019-02-04). This suggests a ramp-up phase or the start of the spring season. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet this increasing demand. I will use the recent growth trend to forecast. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the rapid increase (26 -> 111 -> 277), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the average demand calculation to capture the upward trajectory without being overly biased by the initial zero values, while using 'default' for lead time and sigma until we observe more behavior.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim' product (super-skinny ankle jeans). Historical demand from the prompt shows a sharp upward trend: 0, 0, 26, 111, 277, and most recently 266 in Period 1. This suggests a product launch or seasonal ramp-up. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 348 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the demand has jumped from near-zero to ~270, the 'default' mean (which includes the zeros) will be too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the active demand phase (111, 277, 266). For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (4 weeks) as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise. The target is to ensure sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time + review period (5 total periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans. Demand has been highly volatile since early February: 277 (P-2), 266 (P1), and 158 (P2). The start of the year (Jan) saw very low demand (0, 0, 26, 111), suggesting a recent and ongoing demand regime shift as we enter the spring fashion season. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 719 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from P1 and P2 are still in transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. Given the 158 demand in P2 (down from 266), I am adopting a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the high-demand period (Feb) while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last week. Sigma remains high due to this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Average weekly demand increased from <30 to ~230 units (3-period average).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'Super-Skinny Ankle Jeans' (Ladies Denim), which is high-volume staple. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised lead time is 4 periods). History shows a demand shift in February: 266, 158, 115 (avg ~180). Earlier data from late Jan showed 111 and 277. The 'Carry-over insights' correctly noted a regime shift from very low (<30) to high volume. Given we have a 4-period lead time, we must forecast demand for L+1 = 5 weeks. Since demand is stabilizing after the initial spike, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~180/week) rather than the long-term average which includes zeros. No shipments are overdue yet (first order from P1 is expected Arrival Resolution P5, visible Start of P6).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle Jeans', a ladies' denim item. Historical data showed low initial demand (Jan), but demand surged in February (277 on 2019-02-04), followed by Feb conclude demands of 266, 158, 115, and 117. The current average demand over the last four periods is ~164 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (348 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we have had 100% lost sales for 4 periods. With 1185 units in-transit, our pipeline is full. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~164) following the initial February spike, setting \u03bc\u0302 for (L+1) = 5 periods. \u03c3\u0302 will also be calculated over this recent 4-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Feb-spike: Average demand over the last 4 periods (P1-P4) is 164 units/period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's skinny denim item. We have finally received the first shipment of 348 units (from Period 1) in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived during P5, visible start of P6). Historical demand shows an initial spike (277 in early Feb) followed by a stabilization/slight decline (266, 158, 115, 117, 89). The 'recent_N' average for demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 149 units/period. On-hand inventory is 259, and in-transit is 837 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Total pipeline (1096) is high relative to the recent demand average. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the post-spike stabilization while maintaining sufficient stock for potential seasonal variation in spring. I'll use the promised lead time (L=4) as it has been validated by the first delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Post-spike demand (P1-P5) has stabilized to an average of 149 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a high-waist skinny jean. History shows a massive initial spike (266 units in P1) followed by a stabilizing trend (158, 115, 117, 89, 96). The average demand over the last four periods (P3-P6) is 104.25 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 534 units, with 466 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). We are currently well-stocked, but must maintain parameters that reflect the stabilized demand to avoid over-ordering as the initial pipeline clears. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization (average of P2-P6 is ~115) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will remain at default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized post-Feb-spike; average weekly demand from P3 to P6 is approximately 104 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a staple item (Ladies Super Skinny High Waist Denim). Demand has stabilized following the initial February spike. Over the last four periods (P4-P7), demand has been consistent at 117, 89, 96, and 109 units (mean = 102.75). Lead time is reliably 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1 + L). On-hand inventory is currently high (767 units) due to the large initial orders from P1-P3 arriving now. There are 124 units in-transit (ordered P4, expected arrival P8). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 891 units. Given current demand levels (~103/week), we have approximately 8.6 weeks of stock, which significantly exceeds our target coverage of 5 weeks. Consequently, the OR backend shouldn't place a new order. I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the current stabilized demand regime and default Lead Time as the 4-period lead time is consistent with the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized post-Feb-spike; average weekly demand from P4 to P7 is 103 units (Std Dev ~12).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans has stabilized after a high initial spike in February. Over the last four periods (P5-P8), demand has been 89, 96, 109, and 137, averaging 107.75 units per period with a slight upward trend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 754 units with 0 units in-transit. Since the lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My forecast for the next 5 periods is approximately 538 units (107.75 * 5). With 754 units already on hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand trends. The OR backend uses a base stock policy; however, because current inventory (754) exceeds the projected requirement (~538) plus safety stock, the order quantity will likely be zero. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to reflect this stabilized demand regime and L to the promised/observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable post-spike: average weekly demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 108 units with a slight upward trend.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15 (Period 10). The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim). Reviewing the history, the demand spike seen in early February (Period 1, demand=266) has fully subsided and stabilized. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has averaged 105.6 units per period (89, 96, 109, 137, 97). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries in Periods 5 through 8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 657 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4, the review+lead period is 5 weeks. At an average demand of ~106, the required base stock is approximately 530 units. Since on-hand (657) exceeds this requirement and demand is stable, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current stable regime and use the default lead time method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average weekly demand from P5 to P9 is 105.6 units (Std Dev ~19). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in a stabilized demand regime following a February peak. The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has been 96, 109, 137, 97, and 87, resulting in a mean of 105.2 and a standard deviation of 19.4. On-hand inventory is currently high (570 units) with no in-transit stock, as all initial orders from P1-P4 have arrived. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on demand over (L+1)=5 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand (570 units covers >5 weeks), the OR engine will likely place a zero or minimal order this period, which is appropriate to avoid excess holding costs. I am choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability while capturing recent variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for this SKU has clearly stabilized after an initial spike in February. Over the last 6 periods (P6-P11), demand has averaged 98.8 units (96, 109, 137, 97, 87, 67), showing a slight downward trend as we move further into spring. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 503, In-transit: 28) relative to this demand, as previous large orders from the spike period have arrived. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on history. Given the current excess stock (503 units vs. a projected 5-period demand of ~500 units), the OR backend should be guided by recent, lower demand levels to avoid further accumulation of holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this post-spike stabilization accurately. L will remain at default as lead time has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a stable post-spike regime: Average weekly demand from Period 6 to Period 11 is 98.8 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6 (Period 13). The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim) which has transitioned from a high-demand launch/peak phase in February to a stable, lower-demand regime. Average weekly demand over the last 8 periods (P5-P12) is 97 units with a standard deviation of 20. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory (409) plus in-transit stock (78) totals 487 units, and the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods is approximately 485 units (5 * 97), the inventory position is currently balanced. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the stabilized demand regime without being influenced by the initial February spike. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 5 to 12 average demand is 97 units/period (Std Dev ~20). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May 2019. The demand for the item 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' has stabilized following an initial spike in February. Over the last 9 periods (P5-P13), demand has averaged 91.5 units per week, with a recent 4-week average (P10-P13) of 73.75 units. This downward trend suggests we should focus on the most recent data to avoid overstocking, as on-hand inventory (362) plus in-transit (150) currently totals 512 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (regime length) provides a balanced estimate of roughly 90 units/period (total mu_hat = (1+L)*90 = 450). This will likely trigger a small replenishment order or maintain the current safety stock while on-hand inventory is drawn down.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans) is a staple item. Demand has settled significantly after an initial spike in February; over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), the average demand is 89.9 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 22.8. Comparing this to the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the average demand is slightly lower at 74 units. However, I will use a larger window (N=10) to capture the overall post-spike stability and ensure enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across historical 'conclude' messages (P5-P8). Inventory is currently at 287 on-hand + 196 in-transit = 483 total, which covers approximately 5.3 periods of demand (483 / 90). Since Lead Time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5) requires coverage for 5 periods, the inventory position is healthy but requires a small replenishment to maintain the base stock level against the variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 5 to 14 average demand is 89.9 units/period (Std Dev ~22.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $805.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Ladies Denim Trousers) has settled into a stabilized demand regime following a significant spike in early February. Over the last 10 periods (P6 to P15), the average demand is mapping to approximately 86.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 24. This is lower than the initial post-spike average (which was ~100+), suggesting a cooling trend as we move further into the season. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 15 conclusion message regarding the Period 11 order). On-hand inventory is 259 and in-transit is 224 (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), creating a pipeline inventory of 483 units. To optimize total reward, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods of demand data (N=10) to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. L is maintained at the default promised lead time of 4 periods, which aligns with recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized and cooling: Period 6 to 15 average demand is 86.8 units/period (Std Dev ~24.0), down from the ~100+ units/period observed immediately post-spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Inventory levels are high (261 on-hand + 221 in-transit) relative to the current demand trend. Weekly demand has displayed a downward trend over the last 6 periods, averaging approximately 64.5 units (Periods 11-16), which is significantly lower than the early-year spikes. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (ordered P11 arrived P15, ordered P12 arrived P16). Given this cooling demand regime, I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent over-ordering while maintaining the service level. This more conservative approach ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock down in response to the sustained lower demand while accounting for the high levels of existing inventory already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average weekly demand from Period 11 to 16 has dropped to 64.5 units, compared to the ~100 units/period seen in the preceding regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this SKU has significantly cooled from the initial post-Feb spike (>100 units/period) to a lower, stable regime starting around Period 11 (moving into summer). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 62.4 units per period (67, 94, 47, 75, 56, 48, 47). This transition reflects a seasonal cooling for denim. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 15, 16, and 17. On-hand inventory is 286, and in-transit inventory is 149 (orders from P14, P15, and P16). Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for Period 18 through 22. With current pipeline inventory at 435 units (286+149), and expected demand for 5 periods totaling approx 312 units (5 * 62.4), we are well-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and sigma estimation to capture this lower volume regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed and stable: Average weekly demand from Period 11 to 17 is 62.4 units, maintaining the lower volume regime compared to the early spring peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a lower, stable regime following the early spring peak. Over the last 8 periods (since Period 11), weekly demand has averaged 64.1 units. The most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) show an even lower average of 44.7 units, suggesting a continued cooling trend as we enter mid-summer for this denim SKU. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Period 11-14. On-hand inventory (293) and in-transit units (103) total 396 units, which is approximately 6-8 weeks of cover at current demand levels. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current lower demand regime, which will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining a sufficient service level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical data for SKU 687704002 shows a significant cooling trend in demand following a peak in early Spring. The average demand over the last five periods (P15-P19) is approximately 44.6 units per period, down from the 60+ units observed previously. The most recent demand (P19) was 33 units, indicating the cooling is ongoing or stabilizing at a lower level. On-hand inventory is currently high (316 units), which covers approximately 7 periods of demand at the current rate (L=4). A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on all recent arrivals. To prevent overstocking and further increase in holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime. This will result in a base stock level that is likely below the current inventory + in-transit sum, leading the OR backend to place zero or minimal new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend continued and stabilized at lower levels: Average weekly demand from Period 15 to Period 19 has dropped to 44.6 units, compared to ~62 units in the preceding mid-spring regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 687704002 has significantly cooled from its initial February/March peak. Over the last 4 periods (P17-P20), demand has averaged 34.75 units, a clear decline from the previous regime of ~45-62 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 343 units with no units in transit, following the arrival of the final orders from the mid-spring replenishment cycle. Given the lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Even at the previous higher demand rate of ~45 units/period, 343 units provides roughly 7.6 periods of coverage, which is well above the required safety buffer. My priority is to minimize holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes toward a level that reflects the new, lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this latest stabilization at ~35 units/period and use default L and sigma settings to allow for normal OR backend calculations while maintaining the cap on orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower summer levels: Average weekly demand from Period 17 to Period 20 has dropped to 34.8 units, compared to ~45 units in the immediately preceding period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. This product is a ladies' denim item (super-skinny ankle jeans). Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a lower summer level. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 33.2 units per period (47, 39, 33, 20, 27). The on-hand inventory is currently 316 units, with 84 units in-transit (ordered P21), totaling 400 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The required pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current demand rate would be approximately 166 units (33.2 * 5). Given the current total inventory of 400 units, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime. The OR backend will likely order 0 units as long as I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this most recent stable summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower summer levels: Average weekly demand from Period 17 to Period 21 is 33.2 units, down considerably from the spring/early summer average (~60-100 units).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans (Ladies Denim) has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~100 units/period) to a stable summer regime of approximately 32 units/period (average of the last 5 periods P18-P22: 39, 33, 20, 27, 39). On-hand inventory is currently 277 units, which is ample considering current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the current low demand environment, the OR backend should minimize new orders to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level for the summer regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent summer stabilization (P18-P22), and 'calculate' for lead time for consistency.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny denim jeans. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal cooling trend as we move further into the summer months. Average weekly demand from Period 17 to Period 23 is approximately 32.7 units (25.7 units recently), a significant drop from the spring average of ~100. This downward trend is reinforced by the summer season where heavy denim typically sees lower interest. On-hand inventory is 253 units, and there are 84 units in-transit (ordered Period 21, expected arrival Period 25), totaling 337 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current average demand (32.7 units/period) and a lead time of 4 periods, a base stock calculated for L+1 (5 periods) would be around 164 units. Since our pipeline inventory (337) significantly exceeds this requirement, current stocks are more than sufficient to cover immediate and near-term demand while minimizing holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7, covering the summer regime) and maintain the default lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a low-volume summer trough: Average weekly demand from Period 17 to Period 23 is 32.7 units (Std Dev ~9.2), compared to ~45-60 in late spring.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans shows a continued cooling trend during the summer months. Average weekly demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is 30.4 units, significantly lower than the spring average. The most recent demand (P24) was only 14 units, suggesting a potential further dip or high variability at this lower baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P11 to P16). Currently, on-hand inventory (239) plus in-transit (84) totals 323 units. Given the low summer demand regime (~30 units/period), the pipeline covers over 10 periods of demand ((L+1)*30 = 150). We are overstocked relative to the summer demand rate. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L to maintain the 4-period planning horizon. This will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime cooling further in mid-to-late summer; average weekly demand from Period 17 to Period 24 has dropped to 30.4 units (Std Dev ~10.4).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny ankle jeans. Demand has been on a cooling trend since the spring peak, stabilizing into a lower-volume summer regime. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the average demand is approximately 32 units per period (Avg: 31.78, Std Dev: 10.4). The most recent period (P25) saw a slight uptick to 43 units, but it remains consistent with the established lower-volume range. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 25 arrival of the order from Period 21). On-hand inventory is currently 280 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~32 units and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the required stock to cover demand is approximately 160 units plus safety stock. Since the current on-hand inventory of 280 is significantly above this level (covering roughly 8-9 weeks of demand at current rates), no new orders are required. I will maintain L = 4 and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to reflect the stabilized low-volume summer demand, which will result in the OR backend generating a zero order to draw down the excess on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. This SKU is a 'Ladies Denim' trouser. Historical demand suggests a significant cooling period during June/July (average ~33), but the last two periods (P25: 43, P26: 54) show a potential late-summer uptick or return to mid-season levels. The average demand of the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 33.5. On-hand inventory is 226 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4-6 weeks of demand at the current rate (226 / ~40 = 5.6 periods). Since the promised lead time is 4, and the OR backend uses a (L+1) horizon for base stock, the target inventory level should be roughly (4+1) * 40 = 200 units. Given that on-hand (226) exceeds this target and no new orders are in the pipeline, the OR engine will likely suggest a zero or minimal order. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the most recent stabilized regime, including the minor recent uptick, to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect current trends.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim Trousers) is entering mid-to-late August, typically a back-to-school transition period. Historical demand has shown an upward shift over the last three periods: Period 25 (43), Period 26 (54), and Period 27 (74). This suggests the summer trough has ended and autumn demand is beginning to ramp up. The current on-hand inventory is 152 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (1+L) = 5 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (average ~57) to capture this rising trend specifically, resulting in a base stock target that triggers an replenishment as inventory depletes towards the lead-time demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition detected in mid-August (Period 25-27): Weekly demand increased from a summer trough of ~30 to 74 units, signaling the start of a seasonal autumn/back-to-school trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Skinny Jeans) is entering a seasonal transition as of late August (Period 29). History shows a clear 'summer trough' where demand averaged ~30 units (Periods 17-24), followed by a notable rise starting Period 25. Demand in the last four periods (P25-P28) has been 43, 54, 74, and 57 (average 57), which reflects a 90% increase over the summer baseline, likely driven by autumn/back-to-school shopping. The carry-over insight from P28 flagged this shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 95 and demand trending up, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this newer, higher demand level (averaging 57/week) rather than the long-term historical mean which includes the low summer months. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility of this rising trend. Ordering now accounts for the 4-period lead time, aiming for arrivals in late September.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand shows a mid-August seasonal transition, where weekly demand rose from a summer trough of ~30 units to an average of ~57 units over the last 5 periods (P25-P29). This aligns with autumn/back-to-school trends for denim products. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 51 and in-transit at 162 (83 units ordered P28, 79 units ordered P29), we expect arrivals to start in Period 32. To cover 5 periods (L+1) at the new observed average of ~57, we need a base stock of roughly 285 units. Existing total inventory (on-hand 51 + in-transit 162 = 213) is below this. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent seasonal step-up from 30 to 57 units, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the current volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school seasonal transition confirmed: average weekly demand increased from ~30 in July (P21-P24) to ~57 in August (P25-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a summer trough (~30 units) to an autumn/back-to-school regime. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the average demand is 53.3 units. However, looking at the most recent 4 periods (P27-P30), the average is 55.75 units, indicating a relatively stable but elevated level compared to early summer. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (confirming L=4). On-hand inventory is critically low (3 units) with substantial in-transit orders (238 units). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the autumn shift while smoothing out the volatility of the transition. This targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 weeks), ensuring we rebuild safety stock to meet the sustained autumn demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 has transitioned from a summer low (~30 units) back to a higher autumn/back-to-school level, with demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 54.2 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have experienced a stockout in Period 31 (demand of 48 was only partially satisfied by 3 units on-hand). We are currently in a pipeline-heavy phase with 307 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The arrivals expected in the coming periods are: P32 (83 units from P28), P33 (79 units from P29), P34 (76 units from P30), and P35 (69 units from P31). Based on the recent stabilization around 50-60 units per week, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5 covering the recent transition) to ensure we maintain sufficient stock for the autumn season while the pipeline resolves current stockout issues and transitions to steady-state inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand has stabilized: Period 27-31 average demand is 54.2 units (Std Dev ~11.6), significantly higher than the July summer trough of ~30 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in an autumn/back-to-school demand regime where weekly demand has stabilized around ~50 units (the average of the last 5 periods P28-P32 is 49.4 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 28 order arriving in Period 32. We experienced a stockout in Period 31, but the arrival of P28's order (83 units) restored some inventory in Period 32. In-transit inventory stands at 233 units (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32), which are expected to arrive in P33, P34, P35, and P36 respectively. To sustain this regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the stabilized autumn demand (N=6), and use the calculation method for lead time as it remains stable at 4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has transitioned into an autumn regime. While the summer trough saw demand around 30 units, the last 4 periods (P30-P33) show demand of 48, 48, 50, and 86 units, respectively. The sudden jump to 86 in P33 suggests a potential late-September spike or a trend upwards. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 arrived P32, P29 arrived P33). We are currently operating with very low on-hand inventory (26 units) but have a significant pipeline in-transit (196 units). To account for the recent demand increase while balancing against the inventory already in flight, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift from ~50 to ~80 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility (Std Dev) observed in the current month compared to the stable summer periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand increased significantly in late September, with Period 33 demand reaching 86 units, up from the ~50 units seen earlier in the month.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704002' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a sustained autumn demand increase. In Period 34, demand was 81 units, following 86 units in Period 33, confirming a transition from the summer trough (~30) and the early-autumn baseline (~50) to a higher late-autumn regime. The current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), meaning we are heavily reliant on the in-transit pipeline (209 units). Our lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels during this growth phase, I will use a recent_N strategy for demand (mu_hat) focusing on the last 4 periods (P31-P34) where demand has averaged 66.25 units/period. This captures the upward trend better than a long-term average. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with the volume shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Weekly demand increased from ~50 in early September (P28-P31) to ~83 in late September/early October (P33-P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-October period. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal shift: after a summer trough of ~30 units, demand increased to ~50-60 in late August/early September and further surged to an average of ~83 units in late September (Periods 33-34). Period 35 demand was 52 units, representing a slight cooling from the peak late-September spike but remaining elevated compared to early autumn. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 38 and 240 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35), the supply pipeline is robust. However, considering the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), it is safer to maintain a slightly higher base stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained autumn regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current autumn performance (P31-P35 avg = 63.4, which scales to 317 for the L+1 window) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Autumn demand regime continues: Mid-September to early October (P32-P35) average demand is 67.25 units (Std Dev ~18.5), consolidating the shift from the ~50 unit level seen in August.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019, in Period 37. We have entered a high-demand autumn regime for these ladies' denim trousers. Period 36 demand was 82 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) is approximately 75.25 units, showing a significant lift from the 50-unit level seen in August. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 36 (demand of 82 vs. starting inventory of 47). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P32 order arrived in P36). There are 325 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36), which are expected to arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively. Given the observed stockout and the strong autumn demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific seasonal regime. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Holiday demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P33 to P36 has increased to 75.3 units/period (Std Dev ~15.7), up from the ~50-60 units/period seen in late summer.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans is currently in an autumn holiday peak. Average demand from Period 33 to 37 has risen to 78.8 units per period, significantly higher than August levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 42 units sold out of 93 demanded in Period 37, indicating stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 384 units includes orders from Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37 (89+100+94+101 units). The next arrival will be from Period 34 (89 units) during Period 38. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture the current regime's mean (~79) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent seasonal uplift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 33-37 average weekly demand is 78.8 units (Std Dev ~16.7), up from the ~55 unit average in early autumn (P28-P32).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 is currently in a high-demand autumn/holiday regime. Analyzing the most recent data (P33-P38), the average demand is 75.7 units/period with a standard deviation of 16.3. The current date (Nov 4) suggests we are entering the peak holiday shopping season, where demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle' jeans is likely to remain high or increase further. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels are tight; we have 29 units on-hand and 363 in-transit, but recent periods (P36, P37) saw stockouts (sold < demand), indicating that our base stock needs to be robust to capture the 4-period lead time plus the current review cycle (L+1=5). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current autumn/holiday regime (P33-P38) and ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level to prevent further stockouts during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Holiday/Autumn regime stable at ~75 units/period (P33-P38 average: 75.7, Std Dev: 16.3). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn/pre-holiday season. Over the last 7 periods (P33-P39), demand has averaged 72.1 units/period, showing significant volatility (standard deviation ~17.5). Recent demand in P38 (60) and P39 (51) suggests a slight cooling from the late-September/October peak, but remains much higher than the summer trough. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 78 and 309 units in-transit (P36: 94, P37: 101, P38: 68, P39: 46), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn demand regime while acknowledging the recent high variance. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) period window without over-ordering as we approach the mid-November period.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Autumn demand regime (P33-P39) stabilized at an average of 72.1 units/period (Std Dev ~17.5). Current pipeline is heavily loaded with 309 units in-transit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-18. We are in the mid-November period heading towards the holiday peak. Historical demand for P33-P40 has averaged approximately 68.4 units per week, although the last two periods have seen a slight softening (51 and 49 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full with 253 units in-transit (P37: 101, P38: 68, P39: 46, P40: 38), and on-hand inventory is healthy at 123 units. Given the critical holiday shopping window (Black Friday/Cyber Monday is usually late November), I will maintain the mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the autumn/early-holiday baseline (avg ~68) while allowing for potential volume. This N=8 window covers the shift that started in late September. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) will account for the recent variance in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Autumn demand regime (P33-P40) average is 68.4 units/period (Std Dev ~18.3). Pipeline is well-stocked for upcoming late November retail events.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the Black Friday / Cyber Monday week. Based on the product profile (Ladies Denim Trousers), we should anticipate a significant retail spike. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) averaged ~68 units, but actual demand in the last 3 periods (P39-P41) has been lower, around 51 units. However, giving the proximity to major holiday shopping events, a purely statistical forecast based on recent samples will likely under-order for the coming 4-week lead time window. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 171 units on-hand and 189 units in-transit (total 360 units), and considering a target of covering L+1 periods (5 weeks), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for a substantial holiday surge. I will estimate an average of 110 units/period for the next 5 weeks (historical peak levels seen in early spring and autumn spikes) to ensure sufficient stock during the peak, while maintaining a moderate sigma_hat to account for volatility during high-traffic weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Entering Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Anticipating holiday demand surge; projected mean increased to 110 units/period to cover the L+1 window.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Nov 25) was 119 units, confirming a significant seasonal surge corresponding to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We are now in Period 43 (Dec 2), entering the post-Cyber Monday/Early December holiday shopping phase. Historically for this SKU, high demand levels (~70-110 units) persisted throughout the late autumn and early winter. While the single highest spike may have passed, we must maintain a high service level to capture December holiday demand. The L+1 window (5 periods) needs to account for this elevated baseline. I will keep mu_hat at an explicit value of 500 (averaging 100 units/period) to reflect sustained holiday volume, rather than reverting to the lower historical average of ~68. Pipeline inventory (265) plus on-hand (120) total 385 units, which is slightly below the target base stock for a 100-unit weekly demand across a 4-period lead time. Providing a high mu_hat will trigger necessary replenishment. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Holiday demand spike confirmed with Period 42 demand reaching 119 units (Black Friday week). Holiday demand regime expected to sustain higher volumes (~100 units/period) through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday season (early December). Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (119 units) corresponding to Black Friday week. Period 43 demand dropped to 39 units, but this often happens between major holiday peaks as logistics and consumer behavior reset. Given the product is 'Ladies Denim' and we are approaching the final weeks before Christmas, I anticipate another sustained demand surge. The in-transit pipeline (353 units) is healthy, with orders from P40 (38), P41 (37), P42 (144), and P43 (134) expected to arrive over the next four periods. To navigate the remainder of the holiday season, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 500 (representing an average of 100 units/period over the L+1 window) and sigma_hat to 125 to account for the high volatility typical of December. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Observed Black Friday spike (P42: 119) followed by a sharp drop (P43: 39). Expecting elevated demand (approx 100 units/period) to return for the mid-December Christmas rush.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 45 (Dec 16), approaching the Christmas retail peak. Historically, Period 42 (Black Friday) showed a spike of 119 units, followed by a cooling to ~39 units (P43-P44). However, for a 'Ladies Denim' product, a secondary peak is expected during the mid-to-late December Christmas shopping window. The promised lead time is 4 periods and observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My target is to ensure adequate stock for the remainder of December (Periods 45-47). Total pipeline inventory is very high (507 units), covering several months of average demand. The OR backend uses a capped policy, so setting a high mu_hat will allow the engine to potentially order more if the base stock (L+1 period demand) exceeds the pipeline, though current in-transit stock likely limits new orders. I adjust mu_hat to 100 units/period (500 total for L+1) to reflect the expected Christmas surge and higher holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December Christmas peak anticipation: Demand forecast adjusted to 100 units/period (P45-P47) based on seasonal retail patterns for apparel, following the Black Friday spike (P42) and early December lull.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas holiday shopping week. Based on seasonal trends for apparel (Ladies Denim), we expect a significant demand spike this week and next as consumers finish holiday shopping and utilize gift cards/post-holiday sales. Historically, we saw a demand of 119 during Black Friday (P42). While P43-P45 showed a lull (avg ~43), the anticipated Christmas peak is imminent. To prevent stockouts during this critical window, I am setting mu_hat to 500 (representing an average of 100 units/period over the L+1 window) and increasing sigma_hat to 110 to account for higher volatility observed during previous retail spikes. The pipeline is currently healthy (470 units in-transit), so these parameters will ensure the OR backend maintains a high base stock without over-ordering excessively if the spike is shorter than anticipated. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Christmas/New Year holiday peak anticipated. Seasonal demand forecast set to 100 units/period for the L+1 window based on typical apparel retail cycles and previous Black Friday performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1023.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30). This period represents the transition from the year-end holiday peak into the January clearance and winter trough. Historical data shows that in early 2019 (Jan 7 to Jan 21), demand was extremely low (0-26 units) before a massive spike in Feb. Following the 2019 trend, I anticipate a sharp drop in demand as the holiday shopping season concludes. The Period 46 demand was 64 units, down from the anticipated 'peak' levels and already showing the start of a post-holiday decline. Given on-hand inventory is 193 and the pipeline is heavily loaded with 424 units (total stock position 617), we are significantly over-supplied for a low-demand January. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 250 (average of 50 units/period over the L+1 window) to reflect this seasonal cooling, while keeping sigma_hat at a level that captures the high volatility seen in transitional months. No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR engine given the current stock position vs. the lowered forecast.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal cooling detected: Period 46 demand (64) indicates the end of the Dec peak. Anticipating a low-demand trough in January (target ~50 units/period) based on 2019 historical baseline.
