This is a staple jersey item with steady demand, though it likely sees a gradual increase as we approach spring (February/March). Historical Data: Demand started at 0 in early January and rose to 23 and 26 in the last two weeks of the provided history (late Jan/early Feb). This suggests a 'ramp-up' phase as inventory likely wasn't available or the season began to shift. Current Situation: Period 1 (2019/2/11). On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision in P1 will arrive at the start of P5 (Arrival Resolution). I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods). Forecast: Based on the recent uptick (23-26), I'll estimate a weekly demand of ~28 units, possibly increasing slightly due to the spring transition. Total coverage needed = 5 periods * 30 units = 150 units. Since I have 0 on hand and 0 in transit, I will order the full 150 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand.",

Current inventory is 0 On-hand with 150 units In-transit (ordered in Period 1). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. This creates a coverage gap for Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. With current demand at 54 and trending upward, I estimate average demand over the next 5 periods (Lead Time L=4 + Current Period) to be roughly 60 units per period. Total needed coverage = 60 * 5 = 300 units. Pipeline currently has 150 units. Therefore, I need to order an additional 150 units to secure stock for the late-March/early-April window, accounting for the 0 stock currently on hand and the lost sales occurring until the first shipment arrives.",

Estimating a conservative average of 75 units/period (reflecting the seasonal cooldown), total needed is ~375 units.

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Nora T-shirt', a basic garment with low demand during the winter season. Current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43), and the game ends at Period 47. The demand regime has stabilized at a low-season level, with the last 8 weeks (P35-P42) averaging ~21 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 145 units, which is significantly more than the total projected demand for the remaining 5 periods (roughly 105 units based on a 21-unit average). Because the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), and the game is nearing its conclusion with zero in-transit inventory and a lead time of 4 periods, any new order placed now would only arrive in Period 47 (the final period). Given the existing surplus that already covers all expected demand through the end of the game, no further orders are required. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and create excess ending inventory.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the end-of-year holiday and winter season. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which is significantly more popular during the summer peak (demand ~160) than the current winter low-season. Demand has consistently stayed between 10-25 units over the last five periods (P39-P43 average: 15.6 units). The game ends at Period 47, meaning there are only 4 periods remaining including the current one. With an on-hand inventory of 135 units and an expected demand of ~15-20 units per period, we already have approximately 6-9 periods worth of stock. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Furthermore, the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($1.00) makes excess inventory extremely punitive. The strategy is to liquidate the remaining 135 units across the final 4 periods and avoid any further holding costs or unnecessary arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "End-of-game liquidation phase confirmed: No further orders will arrive before the game concludes at Period 47. Current inventory (135 units) is more than sufficient for remaining 4 periods (~60-80 total demand expected).",

Demand has significantly decreased as we enter winter (December), with recent demand figures being 10, 14, 25, 10, and 7 units respectively over the last five weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 128 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's end (Period 47). Consequently, the objective is to liquidate existing stock and minimize holding costs. With only 3 periods of sales remaining (Periods 45, 46, and 47) and an expected demand of roughly 10-20 units per period, the current inventory of 128 units is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand.

Historically, the demand peaked in the summer (P18: 160 units) and has steadily declined into a low-season winter regime. Recent demand has been very low: Period 44 (7 units) and Period 45 (13 units). The lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50, which is well beyond the end of the game (Period 47). Currently, there are 115 units on-hand. Considering demand for the final two periods (46 and 47) is expected to remain in the 10-20 unit range per period, the existing inventory is more than sufficient.

On-hand inventory is 100 units, which more than covers the demand for this final period. Placing any order now would be useless as it would arrive long after the game ends (lead time is 4 periods) and wouldn't be sold, while overstocking current inventory actually incurs a final holding cost for the period. The goal is to maximize total reward, and since current stock is sufficient for the last period's demand, no further orders should be placed.",
