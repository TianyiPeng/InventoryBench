Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Nora T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend as we move towards Spring: 0, 0, 9, 23, 26. This product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand during the warmer months (February-May). Because we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, and the promised lead time is 4 periods (arriving in Period 5), we must order immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth (avg ~19.3) rather than the 'default' which would include the initial zeros. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as we have no historical arrivals yet to contradict the promise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In Period 1, the demand was 54 units, but since on-hand was 0, zero units were sold. Historical demand samples (0, 0, 9, 23, 26) show a clear upward trend leading into February. The jump to 54 in Period 1 suggests either a seasonal surge or that early data points (zeros) are no longer relevant. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have an 'in-transit' of 35 units (ordered P1), and lead time is 4, we don't expect arrivals until P5. I will use the last 3 demand samples (23, 26, 54) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the early zeros are likely noise or pre-launch data. This captures the current growth phase without being overly anchored to the distant past.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. We are currently in late February. Demand has shown a significant ramp-up from January (0, 0, 9, 23, 26) to February (P1: 54, P2: 90). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from P1 (35 units) and P2 (63 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Demand is clearly trending upward as we approach the spring season. Since the regime is shifting rapidly, I will use recent_N for demand (N=3) to capture the recent high observations (26, 54, 90). I will use the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: February demand (avg ~57) is significantly higher than January (avg ~12), indicating seasonal ramp-up for basic T-shirts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand shows a clear jump from near-zero in January to an average of 66.3 in February (54, 90, 55). The 'Nora T-shirt' is a seasonal basic likely increasing in demand as spring approaches. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we haven't seen any arrivals yet (first order P1 is expected P5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 208 in-transit. With on-hand at 0 and demand outstripping supply until the first shipment arrives, we must maintain aggressive ordering to bridge the gap and prepare for the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the February demand regime while ignoring the January zeros. I will stick to the default L=4 for now as there is no evidence yet of delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: February average demand stabilized at ~66 units per week, up from zero in January. First shipment arrival tracking: P1 order (35 units) expected in Period 5.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/11 (Period 5). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. We have experienced a high demand phase in February (Periods 1-3 avg ~66) which slowed down in Period 4 (demand=29). However, we are still at zero on-hand inventory and have not yet seen our first delivery. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (35 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. In-transit inventory is 309 units, covering the orders from P1-P4. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the February-March transition (avg demand ~57). Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 57 = 285. \u03c3\u0302 is adjusted to reflect recent volatility. We must maintain high base stock levels to recover from the stockout as soon as inventory arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first order placed in Period 1 (35 units) arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 5 (54 units) exceeded the 35 units that arrived. Pipeline inventory is high (274 units) with orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand analysis: Demand has been volatile but shows a clear regime shift since February. Initial samples (Jan) were near zero, while the last 5 periods (Feb-Mar) show a mean of 56.4 units/period (54, 90, 55, 29, 54). Given this is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, demand is likely to remain steady or increase as spring approaches. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this active February-March regime, and default for L since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' stabilized post-January with a 5-period average of ~56 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical data Shows zero demand in early Jan, with a significant ramp-up starting late Jan/Feb. Recent demand (last 5 weeks) has been: 55, 29, 54, 64, and the sample provided initially of 26. This averages ~55 units/period for the current regime. Regarding lead time: Orders from P1 and P2 both arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), confirming the promised lead time 'L=4' is stable. Current inventory status is 'On-hand: 0' because recent arrivals were immediately consumed by stockouts. Total 'In-transit' is 219 units (Orders from P3: 110, P4: 101, P6: 8). The P3 order (110 units) is expected to arrive this period (P7) during resolution, which should finally satisfy demand and potentially leave standing stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-January demand level while managing the high variance observed (29 to 64).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown a demand plateau following a late-February/early-March peak. The current on-hand inventory is 84 units, and we have a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since P8 is 2019/4/1, we have entered April. Recent demand (P4-P7) has been 29, 54, 64, and 26, averaging 43.25 units per week. This is a cooldown from the P2 peak (90). The pipeline (182 units) includes orders from P4 (101), P6 (8), and P7 (73). Due to the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 0.5) will aim for a lean inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the post-peak stabilization (~45 units/week) while ignoring the outlier-like zero-demand periods from January.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-March peak demand cooled down to an average of ~43 units per week (P4-P7) from the February peak (~60+). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current on-hand inventory is 93 units, with 81 units in-transit (8 from P6 and 73 from P7). The P5 order was 0. Demand has shown high volatility: recent weekly demand has been 54, 90, 55, 29, 54, 64, 26, 92. The average demand over the last 8 periods (since sales started) is approx 58 units. However, there's a cooling trend noted in the previous carry-over. For L, I will use 'calculate' since lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 4-8) to capture the current post-peak demand level which averages 51.6 units per week. This results in mu_hat = (1+4) * 51.6 = 258. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent high variance in demand (std dev is ~28.6 per week), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the SKU 554598047 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand after a demand spike of 102 units in Period 9. The current demand pattern shows significant volatility, with recent weekly demands of 26, 92, and 102 units. While the average over the last 5 weeks is approximately 59 units, the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category often sees increased interest during spring (April/May). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4) exactly 4 periods after ordering. No order was placed in Period 5, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 9. The next scheduled arrival (from the P6 order of 8 units) is expected during Period 10, but since on-hand is currently 0, we are vulnerable to losing sales. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher late-spring demand variance and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased standard deviation (volatility) observed in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: demand surged from 26 (P7) to 92 (P8) and 102 (P9), likely reflecting late-spring seasonal interest in basic jersey items.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April (2019-04-22). The product 'Nora T-shirt' is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely due to spring/summer seasonality. Demand in the last three periods has been 92, 102, and 138 (averaging 110.6), which is a sharp increase from the previous average of ~43. We are currently out of stock (on-hand 0) due to this surge exceeding expectations, resulting in significant lost sales in Period 10. The pipeline inventory is 282 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stockout, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture this seasonal peak. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the 110.6 units/period average demand specifically observed in April.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late Spring (April): Demand average surged to ~111 units/week (P8-P10), up from ~43 units in March (+150%). Inventory levels failed to meet this spike, resulting in stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a significant late-spring demand surge. The demand for the last 4 periods (P8-P11) has averaged 111 units/week (92, 102, 138, 112). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts because recent arrivals (8 units from P6 and 73 units from P7) were insufficient to meet this higher demand. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P10, P11). To recover from the stockout and prepare for Continued high demand through May, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current 111 units/week average. With a lead time of 4, the base stock will target (4+1)*111 units. This approach uses the OR backend's inventory calculation to bridge the current stockout gap while accounting for the high in-transit volume (360 units).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is a seasonal spring/summer basic. We are currently in early May (2019/5/6). Historical demand samples and recent performance (P8-P12) confirm a sustained regime shift: demand has surged from a March average of ~43 units to a May average of ~112 units (samples: 92, 102, 138, 112, 127). The system is currently facing stockouts due to this rapid ramp-up. The on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a significant pipeline (504 units) currently in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P10, and P11). We need to maintain a high base stock to cover the L+1 window during this peak period. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat capture this heightened demand and volatility. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a 50% service level target (since profit=holding=$1), but the capping mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering relative to the pipeline and on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized for Peak Spring (May): Average weekly demand is now ~114 units (based on P8-P12), up from ~43 in March. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the spring/summer season. Analysis of the demand history (P8-P13) shows a stable high-demand regime averaging approx. 111 units/week (92, 102, 138, 112, 127, 96). There was a stockout in P13 (only 91 units arrived against 96 demanded), and on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since we are in the middle of May, I expect this demand level to persist. Setting L=4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (P8 onwards). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the variability in this specific regime. Pipeline inventory (480 units) is high because of recent heavy ordering, which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock to determine the period 14 order.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is currently in a Peak Spring demand regime (May 20), following a significant surge that began in April (Period 8). In Period 14, the actual demand was 82 units, slightly lower than the recent average but still within the expected range for this category during this period. Over the last 7 periods (P8-P14), mean demand is ~107 units. The Lead Time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P9 and P10 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units and in-transit is 438 units. Since the order placed today (P15) arrives in P19, the base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent demand window (N=7) captures the current elevated spring levels (avg 107) while accounting for the slight cooling observed in the last two weeks (96, 82). This strategy aims to rebuild safety stock after recent stockouts without excessively over-ordering if demand is nearing its seasonal plateau.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late May 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically maintains high demand during spring and summer. Inventory analysis: We have 102 units on hand and 348 in transit. History shows the lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15). Demand context: There was a major spike in April (P8-P10 avg ~111), which has since cooled slightly in May (P13-P15 avg ~88). To capture this current plateau while accounting for the high spring baseline, I will use a recent_N window for demand that covers the last 5 periods (P11-P15), covering the period since the initial April surge stabilized. This gives the OR backend a realistic mean (avg ~100) and captures the current volatility. Lead time remains at the default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late spring (May) has stabilized lower than the April peak: May weekly average is ~88 units (P13-P15), compared to the April peak of ~111 units (-20%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. We are managing 'Nora T-shirt', a jersey basic item. Following the April peak (~111 units/week), demand in May has moderated to a lower but stable regime. The last four periods (P13-P16) show demand of 96, 82, 85, and 96, resulting in an average of 89.75 units per week. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all concluded orders (P1-P12 orders). Current on-hand inventory is 150 units with 256 units in transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Given standard lead time (L=4), we should cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent_N=4 captures this specific post-peak May stabilized regime (avg ~90). This prevents over-ordering as we move further into June, where demand for basic jersey shirts often stabilizes or begins a slow seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late spring (May/early June) confirmed stable: Average weekly demand is 90 units (P13-P16), down from the April peak of 111 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which is a high-volume seasonal staple. Historical demand analysis shows a peak in April (avg ~111 units), which moderated in May and early June to a stable regime. For the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has been 96, 82, 85, 96, 113, resulting in a mean of 94.4 units/week. While Period 17 saw a slight uptick (113), the overall late-spring/early-summer distribution is consistent. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P13 order arrived in P17). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable late-spring demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility. With On-hand at 104 and In-transit at 232, the total pipeline is 336 units. The OR backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1) while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Period 18 experienced a significant demand spike to 160 units, compared to the previously stabilized May/early June average of ~90 units. This is likely due to the arrival of summer heat and peak seasonal demand for short-sleeved jersey basic T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 arrived in P18). Inventory is currently low (on-hand 20), but pipeline inventory is high (271). However, given the L=4 lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). The average demand of the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is ~107 units, but the last 2 periods show an upward trend (113, 160). To avoid stockouts during this potential summer peak, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 samples, which captures the shift from the May average towards the June peak, and increase sigma_hat using recent volatility to provide a safety buffer for the high demand variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Demand spiked to 160 units (+77% vs May avg), signaling the start of peak summer demand for basic jersey T-shirts.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24. We are entering peak summer demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt. Recent demand history shows a significant shift: Period 18 saw a spike to 160 units, and Period 19 recorded 111 units despite a stockout (meaning true demand was likely higher). The May average was roughly 90 units, but the average for the last two periods is 135.5. Given the product type and the summer season, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to capture this new regime immediately. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 0, and while there are 363 units in transit, the immediate pipeline (orders from P16 and P17) needs to be sufficient to cover the upcoming 4-period lead time window at this higher demand level. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand confirmed starting Period 18: demand levels increased from ~90 to ~135 units/week (+50%). Stockouts in Period 19 suggest latent demand exceeds the observed sales.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are moving into July, the height of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Nora T-shirt). The demand regime shifted significantly in mid-June (Period 18). Periods 18-20 show demand values of 160, 111, and 109. However, the sales in Periods 19 and 20 were restricted by stockouts (inventory was 0 at some point, and we sold all units that arrived). Given the 160 unit demand in Period 18 and subsequent stockouts, the latent demand is likely stabilized between 130-150 units. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this summer peak (approx 135 units/week) across the lead time + review period (1+4=5). Total \u03bc\u0302 = 5 * 135 = 675. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand is zero, so the backend OR logic will order to reach the base stock target minus the 494 units currently in transit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer season (early July) for basic T-shirts. Observed demand in the last 4 periods (P18-P21) has been 160, 111, 109, and 82. However, periods 19, 20, and 21 ended with 0 inventory, indicating that the 'sold' units were limited by supply. In P21 specifically, we only had 43 units on-hand to meet a demand of 82. The 'true' average demand for this summer regime is likely closer to 120-130 units. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have been consistently stocking out during this high-demand period, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the latent demand not captured in 'sold' units (Forecasting ~125 units/week for 5 periods) and increase sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high volatility seen in summer (ranging from 160 to 82).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand (July) continues to outstrip supply; reported demand in P19-P21 is likely suppressed by stockouts. Estimated true demand mean is ~125 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand phase for the Nora T-shirt. Historical data from early June onwards shows a significant demand shift (Period 18 demand was 160). Although observed demand in Period 22 was 59, several preceding periods were stock-out limited (Periods 19-21), suggesting true demand remains high. The carry_over_insights estimate a mean demand of approximately 125 units per week during this summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 56 and in-transit at 512, our pipeline is substantial, but we must maintain parameters that reflect the current seasonal regime to avoid further stock-outs during the remainder of July and August. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and mean, anchored around the mid-June demand spike.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for the 'Nora T-shirt' (July 22). Historical observations show a demand surge starting in late June (Period 18). While recent weeks (P21-P23) show sales of 43, 59, and 101, these figures were heavily constrained by stockouts in P19-P21 and a dip in demand in P22 (59). However, the underlying seasonal trend for 'Womens Everyday Basics' in mid-summer suggests we should prepare for a mean demand of approximately 105-110 units to avoid further stockouts during the lead time. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 108, and in-transit is 359 (orders from P20, P21). Our pipeline covers roughly 4 weeks of demand. To maintain the service level where Critical Ratio q = 0.5 (since Profit=1 and Holding=1), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=6 to capture the summer trend from P18 onwards) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during the summer spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the summer peak for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of recent demand (P22-P24: 59, 101, 152) shows high volatility but confirms the summer regime noted in carry-over insights (~125 units/week avg). The stockout in P21 suggests demand was higher than the sales recorded. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P18-P20 observed in P22-P24). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5. However, due to the high volatility and potential for stockouts during the summer peak, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (covering the summer shift starting P18) to capture the higher mean (~110 units) more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the high summer variance (standard deviation around 35-40).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (P18-P24): Average weekly demand increased to ~110 units, with high volatility (Standard Deviation ~37).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August. Historical data shows we are in a summer peak regime for the 'Nora T-shirt', which began around Period 18. Recent demand (P18-P25) has averaged approximately 108 units following the initial spike to 160. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 222 units, and we have another 222 units in transit (expected to arrive in P26, P29, and P30). With a lead time of 4 and a review period of 1, we must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the summer demand profile (approx 108 units/week), which results in a mu_hat of ~540 for the lead+review cycle. The OR backend will calculate the final order by subtracting the pipeline (444) from the base stock. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the summer peak against the moderate holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), the 'Nora T-shirt' is exiting the summer peak season. Demand has been volatile but shows a slight cooling from the extreme spikes seen in June/July (Period 18: 160 units). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P18-P26) is approximately 118 units. However, looking at the very recent trend (P21-P26), demand has averaged around 97 units. Given the transition into late summer/early autumn, a more conservative demand estimate is appropriate to avoid excess holding costs, as current on-hand inventory (124) plus in-transit stock (320) totaling 444 units is substantial. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25, LT=4). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent post-peak stabilization (~97 units/week) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer peak: August demand average (P25-P26) cooled to ~95 units compared to July peak (P18-P24) avg of ~115 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are moving past the secondary summer peak into late August. Historical data shows that demand has cooled from the July peak (averaging ~110-115) to a more moderate August level (P25-P27 average is approx 80 units/week). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P21 arrived in P25). On-hand inventory is 73 units, with substantial in-transit orders (364 units) including arrivals expected from P24 and P25 in the coming weeks. To avoid overstocking as the season potentially winds down further, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this cooling trend (average demand from P24-P27), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 29 (late August), the demand for the Nora T-shirt has cooled from its July summer peak (~115 units) to an August average of approximately 70-75 units based on P25-P28 data (93, 98, 51, 63). The most recent two weeks (51 and 63) suggest a further decline as we exit the peak summer season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P24 order in P28. Current inventory position: 62 on-hand + 368 in-transit = 430 total. Given the declining trend, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P25-P28) to capture the post-summer slowdown (N=4). This results in a calculated mu_hat of approx 383 ((1+4)*(93+98+51+63)/4), which is close to our current pipeline of 430, likely resulting in a small safety-stock adjustment order or no order to prevent overstocking during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: August demand (avg ~75 units) shows a clear cooling trend from the July peak (~115 units), suggesting the end of peak summer seasonality.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' is trending downward, reflecting the transition from peak summer to early autumn. The average demand over the last three periods (P27-P29) has cooled to approximately 61 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak (July-August average ~110 units). On-hand inventory is healthy at 164 units, and with 198 units in-transit (reflecting orders from periods 26, 27, and 28), the pipeline is currently well-stocked for the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this cooling trend and avoid over-ordering as we enter September, while maintaining sigma_hat on a slightly longer recent window (N=10) to account for the volatility seen during the summer-to-autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for early September: Demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower level (~64 units avg for P27-P29) following the late-August cooling trend.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early September (2019-09-09), a period where demand for 'Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirts has historically cooled from summer peaks. Period 30 data confirms this cooling trend with a demand of 40 units, contributing to a four-period average (P27-P30) of approximately 55.5 units, down from the mid-summer average of over 110 units. Because the current inventory (On-hand: 222 + In-transit: 100 = 322) is high relative to this new demand regime, and the backend OR logic uses a base-stock policy, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 4 periods to capture this downward shift and minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized for September: Demand has dropped to an average of ~55 units per week (P27-P30), representing a ~50% decrease from the July peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (mid-September). Demand for this jersey T-shirt has significantly cooled following the summer peak, with recent demand (P27-P31) averaging 50.8 units, down from over 110 units in July. The current on-hand inventory (234) combined with the remaining in-transit shipment (56) is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), especially given the high holding cost ($1/unit) and current cooling trend. The backend's base-stock calculation (with q=0.5) will likely skip ordering to burn off the excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P24-P27 exactly on time. I will focus the demand forecast on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime for September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has entered a sustained decline following the summer peak. The cooling trend that began in late August (Period 27) has continued through September, with recent demand values of 40, 32, and 28. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is approximately 47 units, compared to the July peak of ~115 units. Current on-hand inventory is 262 units, with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are currently covered for over 5 periods of demand at the current average rate (262 / 47 \u2248 5.5). To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand phase, L is set to 'calculate' based on stable historical performance, and mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower post-summer demand regime and reduce further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late September/Autumn transition: Demand has continued to decline from the September average of ~55 to a recent average of ~33 units (P30-P32), signaling a seasonal exit for this short-sleeve jersey item.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the end of September (2019/9/30). The 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt is in a clear seasonal exit phase as demand transitioned from a July/August peak of ~115 units to a September average of ~36 units (P30-P33). Current on-hand inventory is 216 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, this inventory covers approximately 6 weeks of demand at the current average rate (~36), which is more than sufficient for the remainder of the season. No additional orders have been placed since Period 28, and more inventory arriving would only increase holding costs. Therefore, I am maintaining the lower demand forecast to reflect the Autumn decline and utilizing the existing stock to meet lingering demand without over-ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is a short-sleeve jersey item currently entering the mid-autumn season (October 7th). Historical demand analysis confirms a significant exit peak; demand has dropped from a summer high of ~115 units to a recent 5-period average (P30-P34) of approximately 33.6 units. Specifically, the last two periods saw 46 and 22 units. With 194 units currently on-hand and zero units in-transit, the inventory covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate (194 / 33.6 \u2248 5.7). Given the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0 (implying a 50% target service level where z=0), the system should avoid over-ordering during this terminal seasonal phase. I am setting L to 4, mu_hat to 160 (based on 5 periods of average ~32 units), and sigma_hat to 40 to allow the OR backend to recognize the overstock and cease ordering. No new orders are expected to be triggered as existing inventory significantly exceeds the base stock level required for the cooling demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is showing a clear end-of-season decline as we enter mid-October. Current demand has dropped significantly from the July peak (~115) to a recent 3-period average of ~24 units (P33-P35). On-hand inventory is 171 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 7 weeks of supply. Given the 4-period lead time and the continued downward trend likely approaching winter, we have sufficient stock to cover the remaining lead time plus review periods without further ordering. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the most recent low-demand regime (~29.75 units), which will keep base stock levels low and prevent over-ordering as we liquidate current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-October: Average weekly demand has stabilized at a low level of ~24 units (P33-P35), marking the seasonal exit for this short-sleeve jersey item.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/21. The product, a short-sleeve jersey T-shirt, is in a clear seasonal exit phase as demand has stabilized at a low level averaging ~24 units per week (P33-P36). On-hand inventory is 150 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 6 periods of supply. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods and we have no more units in transit, the pipeline is clear. With a high holding cost relative to the unit price ($1/unit/period) and sufficient safety stock on hand to cover the transition into the off-season, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P33-P36) to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to historical summer peaks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal item currently in its 'exit' phase as of late October (Period 38, Date: 2019/10/28). Demand has been steadily declining from the summer peak (~115 units) to an October average of approximately 25 units. The most recent demand (P33-37) averages 29.2 units per week. There is currently 116 units on-hand with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, this inventory covers approximately 4 weeks of demand. Given we are at Period 38 of 47 and demand is likely to remain low or continue to drop during winter, the goal is to prevent further accumulation of stock and minimize holding costs. As the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 42, which is very close to the game end. Since the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods at the current low rate, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=5) to reflect the low autumn demand regime (~30 units/week), which should result in zero additional orders being placed given the current high inventory levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4, 2019. The product, a short-sleeve jersey T-shirt, is in a clear seasonal exit phase as demand has stabilized at a very low level. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 23 units per week (P33-P38: 46, 22, 23, 21, 34, 18). Currently, on-hand inventory is 98 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. Additionally, 30 units were ordered in Period 38 and are in transit. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the history. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to the profit ($1.0), and the fact that we are approaching the end of the year (Period 39/47) for a summer-seasonal item, the priority is to avoid accumulating ending inventory. I will set L to 4 (promised) and utilize recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized low-demand regime (P33-P38). This should prevent further ordering until existing inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late Autumn: Average weekly demand is ~27 units (P33-P38), confirming the seasonal exit for this T-shirt SKU.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the demand for this short-sleeve jersey T-shirt continues to settle into its seasonal low (Autumn/Winter exit). The average demand over the last seven periods (P33-P39) is approximately 26 units per week. Currently, there are 79 units on-hand and 39 units in-transit (from orders in P38 and P39), totaling 118 units of inventory. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline should cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of 26 units, the total required stock is approximately 130 units. Given that we have 118 units already accounted for, only a small replenishment is necessary to maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs on a declining seasonal item. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the stable low-demand regime since the October seasonal exit, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). The SKU is a short-sleeve jersey T-shirt, which is in a seasonal trough (late Autumn). Demand has stabilized at a low level; the average from Period 33 to 40 is approximately 24 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 69 units with 52 units in transit (ordered P38-P40). Given the lead time of 4 periods, these 121 total units will easily cover the (L+1) = 5 period requirement for a low-demand phase (expecting ~120 units total). Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the backend's critical ratio q is 0.5, targeting a base stock at the median of expected demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable low-demand regime since the October seasonal exit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November), and the product (a short-sleeved jersey T-shirt) is in a seasonal exit phase. Recent demand (P36-P41) has averaged ~21 units per week (21, 34, 18, 19, 10, 14), with the most recent three weeks averaging ~11 units. On-hand inventory is 55 units, and 52 units are in-transit (ordered P38-P40, expected to arrive P42-P44). Total pipeline plus on-hand logic: 55 (on-hand) + 52 (in-transit) = 107 units. At a forecast of ~21 units/week, we have over 5 weeks of coverage, which is more than sufficient for the 4-period lead time. With only 6 periods remaining in the game and a high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low late-autumn demand and prevent further overstocking as we approach the end of the year.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P43 (Dec 2, 2019). The game ends at Period 47. With a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, an order placed now in P43 will arrive during P47, making it the last usable order before the game concludes. Demand for this short-sleeve jersey T-shirt has stabilized at its 'seasonal exit' level following the autumn cooling. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 21.2 units per week. Currently, there are 60 units on-hand and 22 units in-transit (orders from P39 and P40), totaling 82 units of pipeline inventory. Given that we have 5 periods remaining (P43-P47), and the expected total demand for these periods is roughly 106 units (21.2 * 5), the existing 82 units are slightly insufficient. I will set L to 4 (promised) and use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stabilized low-demand regime. This will prompt a final small order to cover the remaining expected demand until the end of the simulation while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late Autumn/early Winter (November/December) stabilized: Average weekly demand is ~20 units (P38-P42), representing the final seasonal baseline for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item currently in the late Autumn/Winter phase (Period 44, early December). Demand has stabilized at a low seasonal baseline; the average weekly demand from Period 38 to 43 is approximately 17 units (18, 19, 10, 14, 25, 10). With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (44-47), the primary goal is to satisfy this low baseline demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid high holding costs and obsolescence. Current On-hand is 59 and In-transit is 47 (34 from P43 and 13 from P40). The P40 order (13 units) is expected to arrive in Period 44, and the P43 order (34 units) in Period 47. Given that total inventory (106) already covers the remaining expected demand (approx. 17 units/week * 4 weeks = 68 units), I will set lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the recent 6-period demand average (~17.6) to calculate mu_hat. This will result in a base stock that likely prevents further ordering, allowing the system to bleed off the existing surplus.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45), and the game ends at Period 47. As this is a seasonal short-sleeve T-shirt, demand has stabilized at a low late-autumn/early-winter baseline. The average weekly demand for the most recent 7 periods (P38-P44) is approximately 14.7 units, significantly lower than the previous seasonal peaks. In-transit inventory consists only of the 34 units ordered in Period 43, which are expected to arrive in Period 47 (actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 65 units, which is sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game (P45, P46, and P47) given the low current demand rate and the incoming shipment. Therefore, no new orders are necessary to avoid excessive holding costs at the end of the simulation. I will set mu_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=7) and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), nearing the end of the year (P47 is the final period). The item is a short-sleeve jersey T-shirt, which is in its seasonal low. Demand has been consistently low for several weeks; the average demand from Period 38 to 45 is approximately 14 units per week. Currently, we have 52 units on-hand and 34 units in-transit (ordered P43, expected arrival P47 resolution). Given that only one period remains after this decision (Period 47), and our total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 86) already covers approximately 6 weeks of current demand, we should avoid ordering more to minimize holding costs at the end of the simulation. For OR parameters, I will use a recent_N window of 8 (P38-P45) to reflect the settled winter demand baseline of ~14 units while maintaining the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are at the end of the calendar year, managing the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm this is a seasonal product that peaked in summer and has since entered a low-volume 'seasonal exit' phase during late autumn and early winter. Demand in the most recent regime (P42-P46) has stabilized at a very low average of approximately 14 units per week (min 7, max 25). On-hand inventory is 37 units and in-transit is 34 units (ordered P43, expected arrival P47 conclude). Total coverage is 71 units, which at the current demand rate of ~14/week, covers roughly 5 periods. This aligns with the (L+1) requirement where L=4. Given that we are at the end of December, we should anticipate the potential for a January clearance drop or a pre-spring ramp-up similar to what was observed in P1-P3 (though P1-P4 saw very low sales due to zero starting inventory). To maintain a Lean position while avoiding stockouts during a potential late-January pickup, I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable low-demand window (N=5) and keep L at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistently punctual.
