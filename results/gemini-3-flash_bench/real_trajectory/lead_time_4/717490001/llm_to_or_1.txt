Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 717490001 (Cat Tee). The current on-hand and in-transit inventory is zero. From the provided historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we have 5 demand samples: [100, 66, 70, 62, 53]. There is a visible downward trend in demand from early January (100) to early February (53). Given the date (mid-February), we are moving further away from the post-holiday/New Year period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no history of actual lead times yet, I will use the 'default' lead time setting. For demand forecasting, I will use all 5 available samples to establish a baseline, while noting the downward trend. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' will allow the OR engine to use the historical mean and standard deviation across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) to determine the initial base stock. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) results in a critical ratio of 0.8, which suggests the backend should aim for a high service level to capture demand and avoid stockouts, while the cap will prevent excessive over-ordering if the mean starts to drop significantly.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), and we have 5 historical demand samples (Avg: 70.2). In Period 1, we ordered 100 units, but they have not arrived yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5 conclude/Period 6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory, and the demand of 41 in Period 1 was lost. To stabilize the OR backend, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Given the slight downward trend in the provided historical samples (100 -> 53), I will set N=5 to capture the full recent history while waiting for more 'post-game-start' data. I'll maintain the default promised lead time (L=4) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic T-shirt), representing stable demand but currently facing a stockout. Period 3 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 178 units in-transit. Promoted lead time is 4. Since the game is in Period 3, orders from P1 and P2 are correctly still in transit. Historical demand suggests a mean of 70.2 units per week (Samples: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53, 41, 107). Demand in P2 peaked at 107, likely exhausting initial safety stock assumptions if any existed. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~66) and use default for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 4 is inaccurate. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility (std dev ~25).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are managing a basic T-shirt. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we began ordering in Period 1, we do not expect the first order to arrive until Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand = 0) because we started with zero inventory and demand has been consistent (mean ~85 units/week). Total in-transit is 286 units (Orders from P1: 100, P2: 78, P3: 108). Historical demand samples (last 5: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53) show a mean of 70.2, but recent actual demand in P1-P3 (41, 107, 106) suggests a slightly higher recent trend (average ~84.7). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat based on the recent 8 samples (5 historical + 3 game periods) which averages roughly 76.6 units/period. Over 5 periods, this is ~383 units. I will use recent_N to capture this updated demand level.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'Cat Tee' (basic garment). We are currently in Period 5 (March 11). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 404 units) are currently in-transit. Per the timing definition, the P1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-4. Demand samples (including pre-game) are: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53 (pre-game) and 41, 107, 106, 83 (in-game). The mean demand of all 9 samples is ~76 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to monitor actual arrivals against the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent in-game demand volatility while acknowledging the basic nature of the product.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey T-shirt, and we are currently in mid-March. Inventory just started arriving in Period 5 (100 units from Period 1), confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Historical demand samples and recent performance (Periods 1-5) show a range between 41 and 107 units. The average demand across these 5 periods is 81.6 units per week. Given the lead time of 4 and the review period of 1, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is low (29) relative to weekly demand (~80), and we have a large pipeline (347 units). The OR backend's default mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will use all 10 historical samples (5 provided + 5 game history). The mean of all 10 samples (100, 66, 70, 62, 53, 41, 107, 106, 83, 71) is 75.9. This is a consistent baseline. Using 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable forecast based on the full observed history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a soft jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item but can see early spring demand spikes. Demand has shown high volatility (41 to 147 units) with a significant jump to 147 in Period 6. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (confirmed by Period 5 and 6 arrivals). Inventory is currently 0 on-hand due to the recent demand surge outstripping arrival. Total in-transit is 316 units (Orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand better captures the recent upward trend (average ~103) compared to the full history. For lead time, 'calculate' is used as the promised 4 periods is verified. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the increased variance seen in the last few cycles.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic T-shirt). Reviewing the demand history [100, 66, 70, 62, 53, 41, 107, 106, 83, 71, 147, 177], there is a clear upward trend starting in March (Period 6), likely driven by seasonal spring demand for basic T-shirts. The last 3 periods have significantly higher demand (avg = 131.6) compared to the initial regime (avg \u2248 70). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). We currenty have 0 on-hand inventory and 359 in-transit (orders from P4-P7). Given the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift and ensure the base stock is high enough for the spring season. Since lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-03-18 (Period 6): avg demand increased from ~70 to ~130 (+85%) following seasonal spring transition.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8, 2019. We are in Period 9. The SKU 'Cat Tee.' is a soft jersey t-shirt, which typically sees increased demand during the spring season. Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 6 (March 18): the last three periods (P6, P7, P8) had demands of 147, 177, and 101 respectively, averaging approximately 142 units per period compared to the pre-regime average of ~75. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 8 (P4 order arrived in P8). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (17 units), and there is a significant pipeline (463 units). Although the demand in P8 dipped slightly to 101, the overall signal for spring remains strong. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and increased volatility of the current spring regime, while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a Cat Tee (Jersey Basic T-shirt), which typically sees increased demand during the spring and summer seasons. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 6 (March 18), with demand across Periods 6-9 averaging 127.5 units, compared to ~70 units previously. Last period's demand (Period 9) was lower at 85, but stockouts likely masked the true potential demand during Periods 6 and 7 where demand significantly exceeded starting on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently behaving as 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). I am currently stocked out (on-hand 0) with a significant pipeline of 625 units. Since we are in the high-demand spring regime (N=4: P6, P7, P8, P9), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current level and volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' as the historical lead times are consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22 (Period 11). The product is a T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand context: Initial demand (Periods 1-5) averaged ~70/week. Since Period 6, demand has increased, though it showed high volatility (147, 177, 101, 85, 84). The last three weeks average ~90, but combined with the surge in P6-P7, the current regime (P6-P10) averages ~120. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 670, consisting of orders from P7 (151), P8 (222), P9 (205), and P10 (92). Lead time analysis: All concluded shipments (P1 to P6) arrived consistently with a lead time of 4 periods. The order from P7 (151 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 11 and be visible in Period 12. Given current stockouts (starting OH=0 in P10 and P11), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the spring regime) to capture the higher mean compared to the lifetime average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we observe that lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The demand regime shift noted in Period 8 remains relevant; however, the most recent 6 periods (since Period 6) show demand fluctuations between 84 and 177, with an average of approximately 119 units. The last three periods (P9-P11) averaged 96.3 units, signaling a potential slight cooling from the peak, but we must maintain coverage for the spring/summer transition for this 'Cat Tee' t-shirt. With on-hand inventory at 31 and 521 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P8, P9, P10, and P11), the pipeline is currently well-stocked. We will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent variability. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a Divided Basics T-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand through the spring and summer seasons. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 6 (mid-March), moving from an average of ~70 to ~115 units per period. The last 7 periods (P6-P12) show demand values of 147, 177, 101, 85, 84, 120, and 94. While demand has slightly cooled from the initial peak in late March, it remains significantly higher than the February baseline. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand spring regime accurately. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5 through P12). Current on-hand inventory is 159, and in-transit is 412 (total pipeline = 571). With L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the OR engine will compare this pipeline against the 5-period demand forecast to determine if more safety stock is needed to maintain the target service level (q = 0.8).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is currently in a demand regime that shifted around Period 6. While the earlier weeks (P6-P8) saw a surge in demand averaging ~140, the most recent five weeks (P9-P13) have shown a cooling trend with demand values of 85, 84, 120, 94, and 67, averaging approximately 90 units per period. This cooling suggests the initial spring surge has stabilized. Lead times have been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods. Current inventory position is strong: 297 on-hand plus 280 in-transit (orders from P10-P13), totaling 577 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock levels based on a mean of ~90 units (recent N=5) is appropriate to avoid overstocking as demand softens, while maintaining the service level (profit/holding ratio is 4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-spring surge: mean demand for P9-P13 is ~90 units/period, down from the P6-P8 peak of ~140.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a stabilized demand regime following a spring peak. Demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged 87.8 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~90 units/period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all 10 concluded shipments. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 315) due to several large orders arriving consecutively (from P8 and P9), but the in-transit amount has naturally decreased (188 units) as these shipments arrived. I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this stabilized regime (N=9, covering P6-P14 to capture the current post-peak variability while transitioning) and maintain the lead time (L) at the promised 4 periods using the calculate method. This approach ensures the OR backend recognizes the lower, stabilized demand mean to avoid creating excessive surplus inventory while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods (P11 arrived in P15 as expected). Demand has stabilized after the spring surge noted in earlier periods. Over the last seven periods (P9-P15), the average demand is approximately 91.6 units per period. As we are moving into late May/early June, demand for jersey t-shirts is expected to remain stable or slightly increase due to summer seasonality. I am setting the forecast parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to reflect this post-surge stability while maintaining sufficient coverage for the (L+1) period window. On-hand inventory plus in-transit stock (479 units) currently aligns well with projected demand for the lead time cycle.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a jersey T-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand during summer. Recent demand history shows a period of volatility: P14 (74), P15 (117), P16 (138). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 110 units, indicating a possible upward trend as summer begins in earnest. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods. With 175 units on hand and 184 units in transit (expected to arrive in P17, P18, and P19), total coverage is 359 units. To account for the recent upward trend in demand and ensure sufficient stock for the 5-period horizon (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~110 * 5 = 550) to catch the summer momentum, while maintaining a standard sigma calculation to manage volatility. This will likely trigger an order to bridge the gap between 359 current/pipeline units and the required base stock.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand ramp detected starting Period 15: avg demand increased from ~90 to ~125 (+39%) across the last two weeks of May.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is currently in a sustained early summer demand ramp. Previous periods (P15-P17) show an average demand of approximately 136 units (117, 138, 154), confirming the upward trend identified in Period 17's carry-over insight. Given the onset of June, I expect demand to remain at these elevated levels or continue to rise slightly. Inventory position shows 94 on-hand and 276 in-transit (orders from P14-P17). All previous orders have arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. To ensure sufficient coverage for the next 5 periods (L+1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this latest early summer regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and 'default' for L since it is stable at 4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which is currently entering its peak summer demand season (mid-June). In Period 18, we observed a delivery failure (arrived=0) for the order placed in Period 14. However, Period 14's order quantity was 0, so the 'arrived=0' is expected and does not indicate a lost shipment or lead time shift. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but 443 units are in-transit (Orders from P15: 93, P16: 18, P17: 165, P18: 167), with 93 units expected to arrive in Period 19. Demand has shifted upward as noted in Carry-over Insights; the last 4 periods (P15-P18) show a mean of 134.5 (117, 138, 154, 129), confirming the early summer ramp. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this 130+ range and maintain L at default to cover the 4+1 period window. sigma_hat is also set using the recent 4 periods to reflect current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 15-19) shows an average of ~140 units, indicating a transition into peak summer demand for t-shirts. Specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) averaged 149 units. On-hand inventory is depleted (0), and there is 511 units in-transit. A critical anomaly occurred in Period 18: the order from Period 14 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival, while the order from Period 15 arrived in Period 19, maintaining the promised lead time of 4. To capture the summer peak while acknowledging the slightly lower mid-May demand, I will use N=5 for mu_hat (covering P15-P19), which yields a per-period mean of 140.6. Multiplying by (1+L) where L=4 gives 703 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed: avg demand increased to ~140 units/period (Periods 15-19) from late-May/early-June levels (~125 previously noted).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is in the middle of a high-demand summer regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P15-P20) shows mean demand is ~141 units (117, 138, 154, 129, 165, 143). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 666 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to 'conclude' messages. However, there is a missing shipment alert: the order from Period 14 (0 units, but it counts as an arrival event) was skipped between Period 18 and 19. The Period 15 order arrived at Period 19 (L=4) and Period 16 order arrived at Period 20 (L=4). The forecast mu_hat will be set using recent_N=6 to capture the summer peak (141 * 5 = 705). This aggressive base stock is necessary to recover from the current stockout and meet sustained summer demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is currently in the height of the summer season (July 8th). Demand in Period 21 reached 206 units, confirming a significant peak regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 159.4 units, which is a marked increase from the previous 'summer ramp' estimate of 125-140. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 573 units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (validated by P21's arrival of the P17 order). A shipment from Period 14 (ordered 0 units) is accounted for, and the Period 18 order (167 units) should arrive in the upcoming period resolution. To ensure the base stock levels are sufficient for this peak demand (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods of data (N=5) and using N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed peaking in July: avg demand increased to ~160 units/period (Periods 17-21) vs previously noted 140 (Period 20 insight).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is in its peak summer season (July). Current demand analysis shows a high-volume regime: the last 5 periods (P18-P22) have an average demand of 151.2 units (129, 165, 143, 206, 113). The drop to 113 in Period 22 follows a spike to 206, suggesting potential volatility or a slight cooling, but the overall summer average remains significantly elevated compared to spring. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this summer peak (~151.2 * 5 = 756). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. On-hand inventory is low (54), and while in-transit (614) is significant, it must cover the next 4 periods of high summer demand. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect current high-demand volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer for this high-margin (75% service level target) item.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Cat Tee) is in its peak summer season. While Period 23 showed a demand dip (79), the previous periods (P19-P21) showed demand between 143 and 206. Historically, July demand has been volatile, but the summer peak remains the dominant regime. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (P19 order arrived at P23, lead time 4). On-hand inventory is 136 with a robust pipeline of 609 units. To prepare for the remainder of the summer season while accounting for the recent high-demand volatility and the dip in P23, I will use a recent window of demand. N=7 (Periods 17-23) captures the start of the high-demand volatility through the recent dip, averaging ~141 units/period. This provides a balanced forecast for mu_hat (1+L)*mean and captures recent summer variance for sigma_hat.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (2019-07-29). Analyzing recent demand, we see a cooling trend from the mid-July peaks: P22 (113), P23 (79), and P24 (87). This suggests a shift away from the July peak regime (~160) back towards a more moderate late-summer level. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~93 units, contrasting sharply with the 160 units noted previously. Lead times are consistently holding at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (222) and substantial in-transit stock (474), the current stock position (696 total) is relatively high considering the downward shift in demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the July spikes. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 22 (2019-07-08): demand cooled from July peaks (~160) to late-summer levels (~93 units/period avg).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. We have confirmed a demand regime shift starting in Period 22 (July 8), where demand dropped from July peaks (~160 units) to late-summer levels. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approximately 90.5 units (113, 79, 87, 83). As this is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, we expect demand to continue stabilizing or potentially soften further as the summer peak concludes. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 211 units, with significant in-transit stock (402 units). I will use a N=4 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime while maintaining a standard lead time setting.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Divided Basics T-shirt) is currently in a late-summer/pre-autumn cooling phase. Since the peak in July, demand has significantly dropped. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 84 units/period, down from the peak of ~160. Most recently, P26 demand was 60 units. With 359 units on-hand and 194 units in-transit (total pipeline of 553), and a current consumption rate of ~84 units/period, we have over 6 periods of supply, which exceeds the required (L+1)=5 coverage. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand regime and prevent overstocking as we move further away from the summer peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current reduced volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is entering late August (Period 28), following a significant demand cooling observed since early July. Demand peaks peaked in June/July (avg ~160) but have dropped to an average of ~74 units over the last 5 periods (P23-P27: 79, 87, 83, 60, 57). The last two periods show a further decline to ~58 units, suggesting a transition from late summer to a lower early autumn baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 458 units, which is approximately 6-8 periods of supply at recent demand rates. With a lead time of 4 periods and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the goal is to avoid overstocking while demand stabilizes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (period 23-27) to capture the current lower regime (~73 units/period average over those 5 weeks). Sigma_hat is set similarly to reflect recent volatility. We expect an arrival of 38 units (ordered Period 24) in the next period's arrival phase, further increasing our stock unless demand picks up. No new orders are likely needed given the current excess on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled further in August: avg demand for P26-P27 is ~58 units/period, suggesting a shift below the previously noted late-summer average of 93.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt (717490001) has shown 2 significant changes recently. First, after the July peak (~160), demand dropped to a late-summer average of 93 (Periods 22-25). Second, August data (Periods 26-27) showed a steeper decline to ~58. However, Period 28 (Aug 19) saw a sudden and significant spike to 178. This may be related to 'Back-to-School' shopping or a late-summer promotion. Given this volatility, I am opting for the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering Periods 22-28) to capture the overall post-peak cooling while accounting for the recent spike. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 318 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since current inventory (318) likely covers the expected demand for the next (L+1=5) periods based on the recent average (~100), the OR backend will likely order little to nothing, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility detected in late August: After cooling to ~60 units (P26-27), P28 demand spiked to 178, potentially signaling a 'Back-to-School' effect.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey T-shirt) is exhibiting a strong 'Back-to-School' demand surge as of late August (Period 28: 178 units, Period 29: 248 units). This confirms the shift hypothesized in the Period 29 insight. Current demand (average ~213 over the last 2 weeks) significantly exceeds the previous summer peak (~160) and the mid-August cooling (~60). We are moving into early September, which likely sustains this school-season demand. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods despite a missing/delayed order from Period 14 (which was 0 units anyway). We set mu_hat using the last 2 periods of high demand (N=2) to capture this new regime immediately and prevent stockouts during this critical period. sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the high volatility (approx 50) observed during this rapid transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School regime confirmed starting Period 28 (2019-08-19): Demand spiked from ~60 to an average of ~213 units/period (+255%) over the last two weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently experiencing a 'Back-to-School' demand regime which began around Period 28 (Aug 19). The demand in the last three periods has been 178, 248, and 131 units, significantly higher than the early August lull (~58 units). The average demand over these last three periods (P28-P30) is approximately 186 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Note: The order from Period 14 was lost or skipped (as indicated by the jump from P13 to P15 arrivals in the history), but recent lead times (P15-P24 orders) have arrived reliably with L=4. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring we target (1+4) periods of demand (~930 units) against the current pipeline of 459 units to recover from the stockout.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0) following a massive demand spike in Period 28-29 (Back-to-School season). Recent demand has since moderated from the peak of 248 units to 131 and 77 units in Periods 30 and 31 respectively. The 'Back-to-School' regime noted in Period 30 carry-over suggested an average of ~213, but the most recent two weeks (P30-P31) average ~104, indicating the peak surge was short-lived and demand is returning to a post-peak level. My strategy is to use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand window (P28-P31 avg ~158) while smoothing the transition from the extreme peak. This keeps the OR base stock high enough to refill the empty on-hand inventory when the 'In-transit' pipeline (742 units) begins arriving. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes (except for P14, which likely never arrived/lost, but most recent history shows consistent L=4).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak was short-lived: demand dropped from ~248 (P29) to ~104 avg (P30-P31), suggesting a return to stabilized jersey basic demand levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is entering late September after a significant Back-to-School demand spike (P28-P30). Recent demand has stabilized around ~100 units/period (P30: 131, P31: 77, P32: 100). The current inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and there have been no arrivals since Period 28 (the 'conclude' message for P32 shows 0 arrivals). However, looking at the history, orders from P29 (163 units), P30 (296 units), P31 (283 units), and P32 (188 units) are all in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, the P29 order is expected to arrive during P33 (observed at start of P34). The current 'In-transit' of 930 units (163+296+283+188) confirms no orders are lost yet. To capture the post-spike stabilized demand, I am using a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat of N=3 (P30-P32), which averages 102.6 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Back-to-School spike (P28-P29): average demand for Period 30-32 is approximately 103 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand phase following a 'Back-to-School' spike, though demand has stabilized at a higher level than the late-summer lull. Specifically, demand in Period 33 was 191 units, and the average for Periods 30-33 is approximately 125 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 33. There is a large pipeline of 767 units (ordered in Periods 30-32) expected to arrive in the next three periods (P34-P36) based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since the pipeline is already very high (covering ~6 weeks of current demand) and the OR backend's capped policy will limit additional orders to prevent overstocking, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stabilized average. Given the recent variability (77-191), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this most recent post-spike regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (P30-P33) has stabilized at a higher level than late-August, averaging ~125 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-Back-to-School stabilization phase. Following the late-August spike, demand has settled at a higher baseline than mid-summer. For Periods 30-34, demand was [131, 77, 100, 191, 83], averaging 116.4 units/period. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 34 noted stabilization around ~125. Currently, we have 213 units on-hand and 471 in-transit (orders from P31 and P32, each for ~200+ units, are expected to arrive in P35 and P36 respectively). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to 'conclude' messages from P33 and P34. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (approx 116 units/period), allowing the OR backend to adjust orders based on the existing large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (P30-P34) has stabilized with a mean of 116 units/period and high variance (std ~49), suggesting a higher baseline than late-summer (P26-P27 avg ~58).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is currently in a post-Back-to-School stabilization phase. Demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has averaged 106.8 units/period (131, 77, 100, 191, 83, 59), showing significant volatility but a steady decline from the late-August peak. The most recent demand (P35: 59) is at its lowest since the regime shift. On-hand inventory is healthy at 437 units, and with 188 units due to arrive next period (ordered P32, L=4), current total coverage is 625 units. At a mean forecast of ~107/period, this covers nearly 6 periods, which exceeds the (L+1)=5 period requirement. Consequently, no new order is needed this period, as confirmed by the existing pipeline. For the OR parameters, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the post-spike demand stabilization period, balancing the high demand of P33 (191) against the low demand of P35 (59). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (P30-P35) has stabilized at an average of ~107 units/period with significant weekly variance (std ~49).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-Back-to-School stabilization phase. Following the spike in late August (Period 28-29), demand has settled into a regime averaging approximately 108 units per period (Periods 30-36). The most recent period (P36) saw demand of 108 units, aligning perfectly with this mean. Inventory is currently high (517 units on-hand) due to large orders placed during the Back-to-School peak now arriving. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Given the current on-hand inventory covers nearly 5 periods of stabilized demand, the OR backend will naturally suppress new orders. I will set the mu_hat to reflect this stabilized regime of ~108 units using a window of the last 7 periods (P30-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable post-'Back-to-School' regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged ~107 units/period (P30-P37: 131, 77, 100, 191, 83, 59, 108, 128) but with high volatility (std ~45). Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P33-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 389 units, which is quite high (covering ~3 periods of demand). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 101 units from the order placed in Period 37. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 490 units. Given L=4, the OR engine needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. 490 units covers ~4.5 periods at the current mean. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike regime while allowing the OR engine to account for the high variance during this period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (P30-P37) has stabilized at an average of ~110 units/period with continued high variance (std ~45).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts has stabilized post-September 'Back-to-School' volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P30-P38), the average demand is approximately 110 units/period (mean = 110.0, std = 42.4). There are no new seasonal drivers expected in early November for basic jersey t-shirts, so I will treat this 110 units/period as the current baseline. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of orders from P29-P32). Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 275, In-transit: 237), which covers roughly 4.6 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 30, and keep L at the default promised value.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a stabilized demand regime following the 'Back-to-School' spike. For Periods 30\u201339, the mean demand is 108.6 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 39.5. This represents a consistent baseline for mid-autumn. Current on-hand inventory is 180 units, and the pipeline contains 349 units (orders from P37, P38, P39). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P29-P32). No arrivals were expected in P37\u2013P39 due to the ordering gap in P33\u2013P36. We expect the P37 order to arrive in P41. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (P30-P39) to capture this stable post-spike regime while accounting for the current variance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has stabilized following the 'Back-to-School' volatility. Over the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the average demand is 108 units/period (std ~38). Looking at the calendar, we are approaching late November and December. While this is a basic item, we should monitor for potential holiday season spikes, though historical data for this specific SKU's late-year performance is not yet available in the game history beyond the current trend. Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (432 units) plus on-hand inventory (59 units) totals 491 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 108, 5 periods requirement is ~540 units. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 11-period regime (N=11) to capture the stabilized post-September baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter season. Historical demand since the post-Back-to-School stabilization (Period 30 onwards) has shown a mean of approximately 111.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 33.7. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 141, slightly above the average. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The carry-over insights have correctly tracked the various regime shifts throughout the year. For Period 42, I will use recent_N to capture the post-Back-to-School stabilization regime. N=12 covers the period from P30 to P41, providing a robust estimate of the current baseline demand and variance (mean ~112, std ~34). This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (P30-P41) has maintained a stable mean of ~112 units/period with moderate variance (std ~34).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are entering the pre-holiday period for a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a steady regime since Period 30, averaging ~112 units/period (P30-P41), but the last two periods (P41: 141, P42: 174) show a significant uptick, likely due to holiday shopping or Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 472 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). The order from P39 (112 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P43). Lead times have been stable at 4 periods. Given the recent spike, I will use a recent_N method with N=13 (covering the post-Back-to-School regime plus the holiday uptick) to capture the higher mean (~116) and variance caused by these recent peaks, while relying on the OR backend's service level logic to buffer against the ongoing holiday demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick detected starting Period 41 (2019-11-18): Demand increased from ~112 average to 157.5 avg (P41-P42, +40%) as the calendar moves into December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the second week of December. Historical demand analysis shows a holiday uptick starting in Period 41 (mid-November), with an average demand of 157.5 across P41-P42, followed by a sudden dip to 42 in P43 (Dec 2nd). Given the seasonal nature of jersey basics, this dip is likely a 'calm before the storm' or a reporting outlier rather than a trend reversal, as holiday shopping typically peaks in mid-December. I will forecast demand based on the recent holiday regime (P41-P43 average), which is approximately 119 units, but maintain a higher sigma to account for the extreme volatility (from 42 to 174). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With only 70 units on-hand and a pipeline of 539, I need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (Review=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand history shows a recent holiday-related uptick (P41-P42 avg: ~157), followed by two weeks of significantly lower demand (P43-P44 avg: ~40). This drop likely represents a dip between early holiday shopping and the final Christmas rush, or a shift in seasonal demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts as winter deepens. Given the game is near its end (Period 47), and we have 536 units in transit (expected arrivals in P45: 124 units, P46: 153 units, P47: 179 units), we are already heavily over-committed relative to the current low demand volumes. The on-hand inventory (114) plus upcoming arrivals is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand. To prevent excessive holding costs in the final periods, I am maintaining parameters that leverage the existing pipeline and minimize new orders. I'll use recent_N with N=5 (P40-P44) for mu_hat to reflect the recent mix of high and low demand (~105 avg), and N=15 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed throughout the autumn and holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Late November saw a spike (avg 157), followed by a sharp drop in early December (avg 40), suggesting highly unpredictable jersey demand in the peak winter/holiday season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23), entering the final holiday peak and subsequent post-holiday period. Current demand has fallen sharply from the late-November peak (~157) to an average of ~44 units (Periods 43-45). This confirms the high volatility noted in Period 45. Historically, the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt saw a demand drop in early spring/late winter, but we must stay prepared for potential post-holiday sales or early year demand shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 188 with 412 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44). The OR backend will balance the current low demand readings with the high variance seen over the holiday period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand decline confirmed: Dec demand (P43-P45) averaged ~44 units/period, a significant drop (-72%) from the late-Nov peak avg (~157).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently experiencing a significant seasonal demand drop in December. Demand for the last four periods (P43-P46) has averaged 41 units/period, compared to the November average of ~112 units. This aligns with the 'Holiday demand decline' noted in the carry-over insights. With 308 units on hand and 259 in transit (including P43/P44 orders totaling 259), the current inventory position is very high relative to the present demand regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this low-demand state and prevent unnecessary ordering while current stock is depleted. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year demand slump confirmed: Avg demand for P43-P46 is ~41 units/period, down from the previous stabilization level of ~112.
