Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which typically has stable demand, but we need to establish an initial inventory position. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows values of 113, 141, 104, 173, and 134, with a mean of 133 and a standard deviation of 26.96. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need for a 1-period buffer (total coverage of L+1 = 5 periods), the expected demand over this horizon is approximately 665 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent average and standard deviation from the provided sample history. No lead time data has been observed yet, so I will stick with the 'default' (promised) lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The item is a basic women's t-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 178 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'In-transit' and will not arrive until Period 5. Consequently, we had a stockout in Period 1 (demand 156, sold 0). Historical demand from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 shows values [113, 141, 104, 173, 134], averaging ~133. Period 1 demand was 156, which is slightly higher but within expected variance for a basic item. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the P1 data point) to capture the trend while staying grounded in recent history. Lead time L is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise. The OR engine will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which is essential to recover from the current 0 on-hand inventory state.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (113, 141, 104, 173, 134, 156, 207), with the most recent sample (207) being the highest recorded. The product is a staple/basic item and we are entering the pre-spring season, which likely explains the rising demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 decision phase). We have 358 units in transit. Given the clear increasing trend in demand, I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent push towards >150 units per week. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three samples. The lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods as we have no data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Billie Jersey Basic T-shirt' is a staple item. Since January, demand samples [113, 141, 104, 173, 134] and recent game history demand [156, 207, 179] show a mean of ~150-160 with significant variance. The promised lead time is 4. Currently, 0 units are on hand because the first order (placed P1) isn't expected to arrive until P5 resolution (visible at P6 start). We have 586 units in transit (178 from P1, 180 from P2, 228 from P3). I will use the last 5 samples (P-2 to P3) to estimate mean demand, which averages 170.2. With a lead time of 4, the formula (1+L) * mu requires coverage for 5 periods. I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slight upward trend in demand compared to the early January figures.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Total in-transit is 801 units. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-4) is: 113, 141, 104, 173, 134, 156, 207, 179, 187. There is a slight upward trend in recent periods compared to the pre-game data. Mean of all 9 samples is ~155, but the mean of the last 4 periods is 182. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand levels observed during the game compared to pre-game data. I will use the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 10 weeks (5 pre-game + 5 game periods) shows a relatively stable pattern with a mean around 159 units/week (Range: 104-207). Recent game demand (Periods 1-5) has been slightly higher (mean ~177) than the earlier pre-game samples (mean ~133). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, the system covers demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total pipeline inventory is 773 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (180 units) expected to arrive during the current Period 6. Current on-hand is low (19), but the arrival of P2's order should satisfy Period 6 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the slightly higher demand observed since the game started, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time is currently accurate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Previous demand (Feb-Mar) has been relatively stable, averaging 176 units/period (P1-P6). However, we are entering late March/April, which often sees a slight uptick in demand for basics/short-sleeved items as spring progresses. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 30, with a pipeline of 729 (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). P3 (228 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P7) to satisfy demand. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the full active history (mean ~176). With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand (~880 units). Given the pipeline of 729 and on-hand of 30, the OR backend will place a moderate order to maintain the service level while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt, an everyday basic. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been consistently stable within the 100-200 range. The mean demand over the last 7 periods is 174.6 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.8. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Total in-transit inventory is 659 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand (175 * 3.76). With 94 units on hand, the total pipeline coverage is roughly 4.3 periods, aligning well with the (L+1) requirement. Given the steady demand pattern without significant seasonality shifts in the early spring for this basic item, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current demand regime. The service level target (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8) suggests the backend should maintain a baseline stock level that protects against minor stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's basic T-shirt, which typically shows steady demand with slight increases as weather warms. Historical demand samples (last 8 weeks) are: 156, 207, 179, 187, 159, 169, 164, 175. This shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 174 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). On-hand inventory is 134, and in-transit is 598. Pipeline inventory (134 + 598 = 732) is being compared against a target stock level for (L+1)=5 periods. 174 * 5 = 870. The current pipeline is slightly below the expected demand for the lead time duration. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the stable recent demand and 'default' for L since the 4-period lead time matches the promised lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Historically, demand was strong (average ~175 in periods 2-8), but Period 9 saw a significant drop to 114 (-35% from the previous mean). This coincides with mid-April, which normally transitions out of early spring shopping but might be a temporary lull. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P9). On-hand inventory is 170, and there are 644 units in-transit (orders from P6-P9). Since demand is currently showing high variance/shift, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent mean (~155) and volatility more accurately than the full history, while still respecting the 4-period lead time. This will help prevent overstocking if the demand drop persists.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 is a Women's T-shirt (Everyday Basic), which generally sees stable demand with potential slight increases as spring moves into summer. The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the historical demand for the last 15 samples (including the initial pre-game samples), the mean is approximately 159 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4), meaning the total demand window to cover is L+1=5 periods. My pipeline inventory is quite high (525 units in-transit + 87 on-hand = 612 total), while expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 795 units. Current lead times are stable at 4 periods. Since demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift yet, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent averages while remaining responsive to any emerging seasonal trends in April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are moving into late spring/early summer, which is a peak period for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Short-sleeved T-shirts'. Recent demand reflects this: Period 10 (219 units) and Period 11 (267 units) show a significant upward shift from the earlier average of ~160-170. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and lost 22 units of demand in Period 11. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product category and the recent spike, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture this rising trend in both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher seasonal demand and volatility. Since we have zero on-hand but 588 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, P11), we need to maintain a robust order pipeline to avoid further stockouts in late May/early June.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 10: Seasonal increase for summer basics (T-shirts). Average demand increased from ~160 to ~240 (+50%) in the last two periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a women's T-shirt, which is experiencing a seasonal demand shift as we enter the warmer months. Evidence: Demand in P10 (219), P11 (267), and P12 (198) represents a significant increase compared to the P1-P9 average of ~160. Specifically, P11 and P12 both resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating our previous orders were insufficient for this new regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12). Inventory position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 718 (Orders from P9: 196, P10: 17, P11: 221, P12: 284). We expect 196 units to arrive during P13. Given the recent demand surge (~228 avg over last 3 periods) and the 4-period lead time, we must set parameters that cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of heightened seasonal demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and higher mean of the summer season.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product 'Billie T-shirt' is entering peak summer seasonality. Demand has significantly shifted upwards since Period 10, averaging approximately 220 units per week (Period 10: 219, P11: 267, P12: 198, P13: 197), compared to the ~160 average in the first 9 periods. The system is currently stock-out constrained (On-hand: 0), having missed sales in the last three periods (P11-P13). Standard lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have a clear regime shift associated with the calendar (late spring/summer basics), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the higher mean (approx 220) and the increased volatility of this higher-demand period. This will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand) to recover from the stock-out and meet the sustained summer demand spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15 (May 20th). The product is a women's T-shirt, which is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand shift as summer approaches. Carry-over insights from Period 12 noted a shift starting around Period 10, with demand rising from ~160 to ~240. Recent demands (P10-P14) are 219, 267, 198, 197, and 222, averaging approximately 221 units/period. The current 'On-hand' inventory is 0 because the arrivals from the small order in Period 10 (only 17 units) were insufficient to meet Period 14 demand. There is a large pipeline (1067 units), but it contains orders that were only increased recently (P11-P14). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of the P10 order in P14. Given the sustained demand increase correlated with the summer season, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~221) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher summer consumption. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed (Periods 10-14): average ~221 units/period (+38% over early spring baseline).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime for a women's T-shirt, typical for late May (pre-summer). Since Period 10, demand has averaged ~217 units, significantly higher than the early spring baseline. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is critical: on-hand inventory is very low (23 units) and we have experienced several periods of stockouts (Periods 11-14) because orders placed before the demand shift (e.g., the Period 10 order of only 17 units) were insufficient. Although a large 'In-transit' quantity exists (936 units), these are spread over future periods (N+1 to N+4). To ensure the OR backend adequately covers demand during the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 10-15) to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility (mean ~217, vs. previous mean ~160). This will raise the base stock level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late spring/early summer (Period 17, June 3rd), a peak season for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand has shifted significantly since Period 10, averaging 218 units over the last 7 periods (P10-P16), compared to the earlier baseline. Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods, which we see confirmed by the consistent arrival of orders from periods 1 through 12. Current on-hand inventory is 82 units, and we have 829 units in-transit. To ensure we meet this sustained higher demand while minimizing stockouts (which occurred between Periods 11-14 due to the regime shift and low ordering in P10), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) representing the current 'summer' regime. This covers the (1+L) = 5 periods of exposure. Sigma_hat is also tuned to this recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10, representing peak early summer demand for women's basic t-shirts. Reviewing the history, we confirmed a demand regime shift starting around Period 10, moving from a spring baseline of ~160 to a summer baseline of ~210-220 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 154, which is slightly lower but likely a temporary fluctuation within the higher summer regime rather than a downward shift, considering June seasonality. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Since Period 10, the mean demand is approximately 210 units (Mean P10-P17 = 209.75). I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current high-demand regime) to capture this level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using (L+1) with L=4 means the OR engine will target inventory covering 5 periods of demand (~1050 units), effectively managing the current 215 on-hand and 768 in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Current date is mid-June (early summer), where demand for jersey basics should be high and stable. We have observed a demand regime shift previously identified around Period 10, though the last two periods (P17, P18) have shown a slight dip (154, 146). These lower figures may be a transient fluctuation or the start of a plateau, but they remain higher than the early spring baseline. I'm using N=9 for demand mean calculation (Periods 10-18) to capture the summer regime while acknowledging the recent softening. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With 344 on-hand and 621 in-transit (reflecting large orders from P15-P18), the pipeline is healthy. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), using the summer regime's average demand and volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). The SKU is a women's T-shirt, which experienced a demand regime shift starting around Period 10, likely due to summer seasonality. Initially, demand jumped to an average of ~221, but the last three periods (17, 18, 19) have shown a slight cooling, with demands of 154, 146, and 157 respectively. This suggests the peak summer demand might be stabilizing or slightly receding from the May high. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. On-hand inventory is healthy at 277, with 651 units in-transit (orders from P16-P19). To capture the current stabilized but still summer-level demand, I am using a recent_N window of 10 periods (covering P10-P19), which averages ~188 units/period. This protects against the earlier May spikes while respecting the current June baseline. Lead time is set to default (4), and sigma_hat will also use the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the summer spike (P10-P16 avg ~220), demand has moderated in June (P17-P19 avg ~152).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt entering July (peak summer). Demand historically shifted in Period 10 from a spring average of ~160 to a summer peak of ~220 (Periods 10-16). However, recent June demand (Periods 17-20) has moderated to a stable average of 153 units (154, 146, 157, 155), suggesting the initial 'summer' surge was a front-loaded seasonal spike. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current stable demand regime (avg 153). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (P16 order arrived P20). Parameter mu_hat will be set using recent_N=4 periods to reflect the stabilized demand, ensuring the (L+1) coverage window accounts for 5 periods of forecasted demand (~765 units). Current total inventory (on-hand 299 + in-transit 609 = 908) is slightly above this target, so the OR engine will likely order the minimum or cap to prevent excess holding cost while maintaining a high service level for the remainder of the summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in June (P17-P20) at an average of 153 units/period after a front-loaded summer peak in May.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019-07-08 (Period 22), demand for this everyday basics T-shirt has clearly stabilized following the late spring (May) peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been 154, 146, 157, 155, and 140, averaging 150.4 units/period with significantly lower volatility than the preceding spike period. Current inventory is high: 385 units on-hand plus 383 units in pipeline (from orders in P18-P20), totaling 768 units. With a lead time of 4, our coverage needs to span 5 periods of demand (approx 750 units). Since current total inventory (768) already meets this target, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized 150-unit demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P17-P21 average is 150 units/period (\u03c3 approx 6.5). Summer peak has fully subsided into a consistent mid-summer baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 23 (July 15). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized following the May/early June seasonal spike. In the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 141 units (154, 146, 157, 155, 140, 94), with a notable drop in the most recent period to 94. Carry-over insights suggest a stabilized regime of ~150 units/period since Period 17. On-hand inventory is currently high at 419 units, combined with 255 in-transit units (total pipeline 674), which is significantly higher than the expected (L+1) demand of ~750 based on the 150 average. However, given the recent dip to 94 and the date being mid-July, we are likely entering a late-summer low. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this post-peak stabilization and sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility (especially the drop to 94). The backend will naturally order less or zero until the high on-hand inventory is depleted, balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in mid-summer (P17-P22): Average decreased slightly to 141 units/period. The most recent period (P22) showed a drop to 94 units, potentially signaling the start of a late-summer seasonal decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22nd. Demand for this summer t-shirt has clearly cooled from its May/June peak. Demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 140, 94, and 105, averaging 113 units/period. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around 150, but the most recent 2-week dip below 110 suggests the late-summer seasonal decline is accelerating. On-hand inventory is high (434 units), and with 211 units in-transit, our pipeline is very healthy relative to the lowering demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-summer downturn while maintaining a 4-period lead time. This will likely result in a low or zero order to burn off excess inventory and avoid high holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand decline confirmed: Average demand for P21-P23 dropped to 113 units/period, a ~25% decrease from the mid-summer plateau (~150).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late summer. In the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged 112.5 units (140, 94, 105, 111), confirming a regime shift downwards from the mid-summer average of 150. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high (458 units) and there are 76 units in-transit (P23 order), totaling 534 units of pipeline inventory. Given that the target base stock for a (L+1)=5 period window at the current demand rate is roughly 560-600 units, and on-hand inventory already covers approximately 4 periods of demand, I am using recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower late-summer demand regime. This will prevent overstocking during the seasonal wind-down while utilizing existing inventory to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P24) stabilized at a lower average of ~113 units/period, down from the mid-summer plateau of ~150.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic top has continued its late-summer decline, consistent with previous years' seasonal cycles where school-readiness and cooler weather transition demand away from summer basics. Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged ~107 units/period, down from the June average of ~150. Specifically, the last three periods (P23-P25) have averaged ~100 units. On-hand inventory (372) plus in-transit (142) totals 514 units, which is high given the downward demand trend. No order was placed in Period 21, 22, or 24, resulting in a gap in arrivals which is reflected in the 0 arrival for Period 25. An order of 66 units was placed in Period 25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized late-summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Given the high pipeline and declining demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders until inventory levels normalize against the lower demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P25) stabilized at ~107 units/period (\u03c3 ~19), confirming a sustained ~30% decrease from the mid-summer plateau.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12), and the product is a women's T-shirt. Historical data shows demand has significantly declined from its summer peak (~220 units) to a mid-summer plateau (~150 units), and finally to a late-summer lower regime. Demand in the last three periods (P24-P26) has been 111, 86, and 70, averaging approximately 89 units per period. This downward trend is consistent with the end of the summer season for basics. I am setting N=6 for mu_hat (covering P21-P26) to capture this lower late-summer regime while providing enough sample stability, yielding an average of approximately 101 units per period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory (302) plus in-transit (204) totals 506 units. Given the lower demand forecast and low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a target service level of ~80%), the system should naturally reduce ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P26) has further softened to an average of ~101 units/period, continuing the seasonal decline from the mid-summer plateau.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its late-summer seasonal decline. The average demand over the last seven periods (P21-P27) is ~95 units/period, significantly lower than the mid-summer plateau of ~150. Specifically, the last three periods (P25-P27) have shown a steady drop (86, 70, 58), suggesting the seasonal floor has not yet been reached as we move into late August. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). On-hand inventory is currently high (320 units), which covers over 5 periods of demand at current rates without even considering in-transit units. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~95), effectively lowering the base stock to avoid excessive holding costs while the product enters the end-of-season phase. This will result in smaller or zero orders until the inventory level normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P27) shows a significant and sustained contraction to an average of ~95 units/period (approx 35% decline from mid-summer plateau), with the most recent three periods indicating a continued downward trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), and demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline. Over the last 8 periods (P21-P28), demand has averaged 95.25 units, significantly down from the mid-summer average of 150. Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28), the average is 84.6 units. Since we are moving into the end of August / early September, demand is expected to either stabilize at a lower baseline or continue to drift slightly lower as seasonal transition occurs. My inventory levels (on-hand 222 + in-transit 206 = 428) are quite high relative to this demand, sufficient to cover roughly 4-5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent downward-trending regime. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals (when they occur, e.g., P27) continue to confirm a 4-period duration. The OR backend will see the high pipeline inventory and the lowered mu_hat and likely place small or zero orders to draw down the existing stock surplus and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-summer demand regime (P24-P28): average demand has dropped further to ~85 units/period, representing a ~40% reduction from the mid-summer plateau.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in a confirmed late-summer/early-autumn contraction phase for this short-sleeved jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly decreased from its summer peak (~220 units) and mid-summer plateau (~150 units). The recent demand history (P24-P29) shows values of 111, 86, 70, 58, 98, and 63. The average over these last six periods is approximately 81 units, significantly lower than earlier regimes. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (P23 arrived in P27, P25 arrived in P29). Inventory levels (On-hand: 225, In-transit: 175) are currently high relative to this softened demand. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a 0.8 service level (profit $4 vs holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower late-season baseline and setting sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter remains at default since the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand regime (P24-P29) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~81 units/period, a ~45% reduction from the mid-summer plateau (~150) and ~60% below the summer peak (~220).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has exited its summer peak and settled into a lower demand regime reflecting early autumn. Over the last seven periods (P24-P30), demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a lower level: the average demand for P24-P30 is approximately 77 units per period, with the most recent sample (P30) at 51 units. Carry-over insights confirm this sustained contraction. On-hand inventory (236) plus in-transit stock (158) totals 394 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat will capture the stabilized lower demand (avg ~66 for P26-P30), while using a recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat will capture the volatility during this transition. This conservative forecast prevents over-ordering as we move further into the autumn season for a summer staple.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand regime (P26-P30) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~66 units/period, roughly 55% below the mid-summer plateau (~150).

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' (women's everyday basic T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-September. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 38 units, confirming a sustained downward trend from the summer peaks. The current early-autumn regime (P26-P31) averages approximately 61 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 243 and in-transit at 113, we have 356 units available to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). Even at the regime average, 5 periods of demand would only total ~305 units. Given the high inventory and decreasing demand, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower volume, and use default for L and sigma_hat as the current inventory level is more than sufficient to absorb variance.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand regime (P26-P31) has stabilized at a lower average of ~61 units/period, down from ~81 in the late-summer phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in an early-autumn demand regime for women's basic jersey t-shirts. Demand has significantly decelerated, dropping from a summer peak of ~220 units to an average of ~61 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31). The most recent period (P32) shows a further drop to 28 units, suggesting we have not yet hit the floor or are entering a very low-demand late-autumn phase. Inventory is currently high (on-hand 248) compared to this low demand. In-transit arrivals from Periods 29-32 are expected in the coming weeks (Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods). To avoid excessive holding costs, I am forecasting demand using the most recent 7 periods (P26-P32), which captures the autumn downturn while smoothing out the very low P32 outlier. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of approximately 57 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (P26-P32): average demand has stabilized at ~57 units/period, roughly 62% below the mid-summer plateau (~150) and 74% below the summer peak (~220).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a sustained autumn demand decline. Recent demand samples (P31: 38, P32: 28, P33: 53) show a mean of 39.7 units/period. The Carry-over Insights highlight a stabilized 'Autumn demand regime' starting from P26. Using N=8 for mu_hat (P26-P33) covers this entire regime, providing an average demand of approximately 55 units/period. This captures the broader autumn level while accounting for the recent low-volume volatility. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 230), which is more than enough to cover the lead time + review period demand (expected ~275 units total pipeline need vs current 230 on-hand + 108 in-transit = 338 total position). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No new significant regime shift beyond the ongoing seasonal decline is detected.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a low-volume autumn regime. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is 55.5 units/period, with the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) even lower at 42.2 units/period. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 234 units, which is significantly high given the current demand rate (sufficient for ~5 periods without additional stock). There is also an in-transit order of 63 units placed in Period 32, which is expected to arrive in Period 36. To avoid mounting holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized lower demand of ~42 units. This will signal the OR engine to pause ordering until current inventory levels are drawn down to meet the lower target stock level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized further (P30-P34): average demand dropped to ~42 units/period, reflecting a 72% decline from the mid-summer plateau.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as we enter mid-October. Current inventory (210 on-hand + 63 in-transit) is significantly higher than required for the current demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has averaged approximately 39 units per period (39, 28, 53, 41, 24), but the most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) show a further softening to ~39.3 units. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to a (1+L) requirement of roughly 200 units (based on 40 units/period * 5 periods), the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods to capture this stabilized autumn low and use 'calculate' for L as lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized (P30-P35): average demand is ~39 units/period, representing a 74% decline from the mid-summer plateau (~150).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 is a woman's everyday jersey basic T-shirt. Demand has significantly decreased as we enter late October, following a predictable seasonal pattern for short-sleeved tops. The most recent demand (P30-P36) has averaged ~40 units/period (38, 28, 53, 41, 24, 43). Current on-hand inventory is 230 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 5 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods and demand is still in a low-regime/decline phase, no new orders are necessary. The pipeline is currently empty (In-transit: 0) after the P32 order arrived in P36. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (approx 40 units/period) while maintaining the default lead time of 4. High on-hand stock relative to demand will naturally result in zero orders from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Early Winter demand regime (P30-P36) confirmed at ~40 units/period, representing an 82% decline from the summer peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019, moving deep into the autumn/winter season. Demand for this short-sleeved jersey top (561445005) has significantly declined as expected for a summer basic. The recent demand regime (P31-P37) shows an average of approximately 36 units/period (38, 28, 53, 41, 24, 43, 25). My current on-hand inventory is 205 units with 0 units in-transit. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. My current inventory (205) is much higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (approx 36 * 5 = 180). Therefore, the OR backend should not place new orders, as it would only increase holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the current low-demand stability (avg ~36, std ~10), and use 'calculate' for lead time since recent arrivals have consistently followed the 4-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime fully stabilized (P31-P37): average demand ~36 units/period, roughly 84% below the summer peak, as seasonal relevance for short-sleeved basics diminishes.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's short-sleeved jersey top) is in a deep low-demand regime as we enter November (Period 39). Demand has been consistently low for seven periods (P32-P38), averaging approximately 36.5 units per period, which aligns with the seasonal transition to winter for short-sleeved basics. Currently, there are 173 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. With an average demand of ~36 units, the on-hand inventory covers approximately 4.8 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, my current inventory is sufficient to cover the (L+1) window (approx 180 units needed vs 173 available). I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. This will likely result in a zero or near-zero order from the OR backend, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to the current low demand and sufficient stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, entering the deep winter season for women's short-sleeved jersey tops. Demand has dropped significantly, with the most recent sample at Period 39 being only 9 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 26.6 units, but the trend is clearly downward as seasonal relevance hits its nadir. Current inventory (On-hand: 164, In-transit: 24) is extremely high relative to this low-demand regime, covering several months of stock at current rates. To minimize holding costs and prevent further overstocking during this low-sales phase, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 100 (which for 1+L = 5 periods corresponds to a forecast of 20 units per period) and sigma_hat to 30 to reflect the volatility of these low numbers. This will effectively stop the OR backend from placing new orders until the inventory levels align with winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand floor reached (Period 39): Demand dropped to 9 units, with a 5-period average (P35-P39) of ~27 units/period, marking the seasonal low for short-sleeved basics.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The T-shirt 'Billie' is in its seasonal low-demand phase (winter) for the Northern Hemisphere. Recent demand has stabilized significantly: the last five periods (P36-P40) demand values are 43, 25, 32, 9, 12, averaging ~24 units per period. The 10-period average is ~30, but the most recent 5 periods better capture the current winter trough. We are currently carrying 152 units on-hand with 24 units in-transit (P39 order), totaling 176 units. With a demand of ~24 units/period and a lead time of 4, our 'protection period' (L+1 = 5 periods) requires roughly 120 units. Since current inventory (176) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to align with the current lower demand baseline, and sigma_hat with recent_N=10 to provide slightly more buffer for potential volatility while still reflecting the seasonal decline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal item. We are currently in late November (Period 42), heading into the winter low season. Demand has significantly decreased from its summer peak of ~220 to a current 5-period average (P37-P41) of approximately 19 units per period. Specifically, the last three periods (P39-P41) have shown very low demand (9, 12, and 17 units). On-hand inventory is 135 units, with 24 units in transit (ordered P39, expected P43). Current inventory levels (135 on-hand + 24 in-transit = 159 total) are already sufficient to cover over 8 periods of demand at the current average rate of ~19/period. Since the game ends at Period 47, we have only 6 periods remaining. The priority is to minimize holding costs by not ordering additional stock, as the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory should comfortably satisfy demand for the remainder of the season. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized winter floor.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed for short-sleeved basics (P37-P41): average demand has stabilized at ~19 units/period, representing an ~87% reduction from the summer plateau (~150).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the deep winter season. Demand for this short-sleeved basic item is at its seasonal low, with a 5-period average (P38-P42) of ~22.4 units. On-hand inventory is 93 units, which significantly exceeds the expected demand for the next lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~23 units = 115 units, but we already have 93 on hand plus 24 in-transit, totaling 117 units). Recent lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low seasonal demand, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic will likely trigger a zero or near-zero order. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent winter demand floor while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Winter low-demand regime persistent. P38-P42 average demand is ~22 units/period, representing the seasonal floor for the short-sleeved SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the final periods of the game (44 out of 47). This product (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a winter low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 22 units over the last five periods (P39-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 105 units and pipeline inventory is 22 units (total coverage of 127 units). Given the remaining time in the simulation (4 periods: P44, P45, P46, P47) and the current mean demand, the existing stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand without further ordering. Ordering more now would only incur unnecessary holding costs, as arrivals from a Period 44 order (L=4) would not arrive until Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime using a recent window (N=5) to ensure the OR backend's target stock level remains below our current inventory, effectively halting new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing a seasonal floor for short-sleeved t-shirts. Demand has further plummeted to single digits (7 units in P44). The current 'Winter low-demand regime' is confirmed, but recent samples (P40-P44) show an even lower average: (12+17+42+12+7)/5 = 18 units/period. The outlier of 42 (P42) aside, the trend is extremely low. On-hand inventory is 98 units, and with in-transit of 22 units (total 120), we have approximately 6-10 weeks of stock at current demand levels. Given the game ends in Period 47, we should focus on liquidating remaining stock to minimize holding costs, rather than ordering more. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the absolute seasonal low, which will result in no new orders given the high current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Early-winter demand floor reached (P40-P44): average demand is ~18 units/period (with one P42 anomaly of 42), representing the lowest seasonal point for this SKU.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. The product is a short-sleeved jersey top (Everyday Basics), which is currently in its seasonal low-demand period (winter). Demand in the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has been consistently low: 42, 12, 7, 19, 24 (average ~21 units). However, a large order of 230 units was placed in Period 46, which is significantly higher than the current demand floor. This may be prep for a spring restock, but for current OR parameter setting, we must focus on the established winter regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the P39 order arriving in P43). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable winter floor (~21 units/period). This prevents further massive ordering while on-hand (55) and in-transit (252) are more than sufficient to cover demand for the next 5 periods (expected total demand \u2248 105 units).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed (P42-P46): average demand is ~21 units/period, consistent with seasonal lows for short-sleeved basics.
