Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand data shows a significant jump in the latest sample (Period 0: 113 units) compared to the previous four weeks (avg: 53 units). This suggest a potential regime shift or early spring seasonality for ladies' denim. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to establish a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the abrupt increase to 113, using the last 3 samples (62, 60, 113) provides a more responsive mean (avg 78.3) while being cautious of the single 113 spike. mu_hat needs to be (1+L)*mean. Calculated estimate: 5 * 78.3 = 391.5. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent increase without overreacting to just the last week.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand shows a significant spike in the most recent sample (2019-02-04: 113 units) and the actual demand from Period 1 (148 units), indicating a strong upward trend or seasonal shift as we move into February. Inventory is currently critical: 0 on-hand, 148 demand lost in Period 1. There are 128 units in-transit from Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4. Since L=4, these won't arrive until Period 5 (visible Period 6). Given the inventory stockout and rising demand (avg of last 2 samples is ~130), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the shift from the low early-Jan base (36-62) to the current level (113-148). For L, I will use 'default' as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4. This approach aims to set a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout and meet the observed demand growth.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The SKU is active Ladies Denim. Demand has surged significantly following a period of 36-113 units in the training set to 148 and 171 in the first two weeks of February/March, likely due to spring season transitions. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (P1) is still within the promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in P5). Total in-transit is 308 (128 from P1 + 180 from P2). Given the significant demand jump, I am calculating mu_hat based on the two most recent observed periods (average ~160) to avoid underestimating the spring peak. The backend will multiply this by (1+L). Sigma_hat is also updated to reflect the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~65 to ~160 (+145%) as per P1-P2 results.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees high demand in spring (February/March). Historical data before Period 1 showed low demand (36-113), but since Period 1 (starting Feb 11), demand has surged to a new regime (148, 171, 131), averaging approximately 150 units per week. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 495 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Period 4, the first order (placed in P1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (1 + 4 = 5) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, we remain out of stock for now. I am setting L to default (4). For mu_hat, I'm using the last 3 samples (148, 171, 131) which represent the new demand regime (approx 150/week). Over (L+1)=5 periods, this is 750 units. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this new high-demand period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is Ladies Denim (Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand samples (Jan) were low (avg ~45), but since Period 1 (Feb), demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 138.5 units over the last 4 periods (148, 171, 131, 104). We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) because our initial orders haven't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (P1+4=P5). We should see this confirmed in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Total pipeline inventory is 679. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime (mu ~ 138.5). Since L=4, mu_hat should target (1+L)*138.5 \u2248 692.5. The OR backend will compute this using recent_N. Sigma will also be calculated over this same period to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we received the first shipment of 128 units ordered in Period 1, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand has cooled from the February peak (Feb avg ~150) to a more moderate level (last 3 periods: 131, 104, 72; avg ~102). Since L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). There are 565 units in-transit and 56 on-hand, totaling 621 units. With a recent demand average of approximately 102, the projected needs for 5 periods is around 510 units. The current total inventory (621) is already sufficient. To avoid excessive holding costs (holding cost = profit), I am lowering mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent cooling in demand while maintaining the default lead time (4) and volatility estimate to ensure a reasonable buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderating: March demand (P3-P5) averaged 102 units compared to Feb average of ~160.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows a peak in February (averaging ~150-170), which has since moderated in March (P3-P6 average: 106.5). The most recent demand was 119. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being met exactly (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 117 units on-hand and 385 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). Given L=4, my parameters must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). With demand moderating, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the post-peak March levels (avg ~107), resulting in a base stock level calculation of (1+4)*107 = 535. Since on-hand (117) + in-transit (385) = 502, the OR backend will place a small adjustment order. I will use recent_N for sigma to account for the reduced volatility compared to the Feb peak.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived at P5, P2 arrived at P6). Demand stabilizer: March weekly demand has stabilized between 72-119 (mean ~107) following the February peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Ladies Ankle Jeans) is entering the spring season. Historical demand in March (P3-P7: 131, 104, 72, 119, 168) shows a mean of 118.8 units, but with a significant jump to 168 in the most recent period (P7), likely indicating a spring demand surge. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand is 136, and in-transit is 229 (orders from P4, P5, and P7). Total pipeline (365) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the recent spike to 168 and previous seasonal peaks, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat also uses N=5 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the shift from 119 to 168.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge detected: Period 7 demand (168) is a 40% increase over the March average (120), signaling the start of the spring retail season for denim.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early April (2019/4/8). Historical demand shows a significant increase: February mean was ~150, March moderated to ~115, but Period 7 and Period 8 have surged back to 168 and 142 respectively (mean of 155). This aligns with the 'Spring demand surge' identified in carry-over insights for 'Ankle-length jeans'. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at P5-P8). Current on-hand is 178, and pipeline is 222 (orders from P5, P7, and P8). To maintain a high service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), and considering the upward momentum of spring demand, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current two-week average (155) projected over the lead time of 4 + 1 review period. Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility between the high/low of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Demand in early April (P7-P8) has averaged 155 units, a 35% increase over the March average of 115 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. We are in the middle of a spring seasonal demand phase for denim (SKU 399256023). History shows lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 7, demand has been volatile but generally elevated (168, 142, 91), averaging 133 units. The most recent demand (P9 = 91) shows a dip, but given the seasonal context (April/Spring), we should maintain a robust forecast to avoid stockouts as lead-time arrivals replenish our inventory. I will use the recent 3 periods (P7-P9) to capture this current spring demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak with the subsequent dip. On-hand is 101, but the substantial in-transit (394 units) will begin arriving from P10 onwards (beginning with the 0-unit order from P6, then the 31-unit order from P7).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (April) for denim remains elevated but volatile, with a 3-period average of 133 units (P7-P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. The product is Ladies Denim (Ankle-length jeans), which typically experiences high demand during the spring retail season. Recent demand has been volatile: Period 9 demand was 91 and Period 10 was 69 (a significant drop compared to the 130+ average in early April). However, history shows February (P1-P3) averaged ~150 and March averaged ~107. The drop in P10 may be a transient dip or a stabilization before May. Given the lead time (L=4) and (L+1) exposure, I need to account for upcoming May demand. Transitioning from the high-mid 100s to a more stable forecast is prudent. The current pipeline of 568 units is very healthy. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (P6-P10) which averages ~118 units per period, providing a balanced forecast that weights the recent slowdown against the spring peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April (P9-P10): Demand dropped from the 140-160 range (P7-P8) to an average of 80 (P9-P10), suggesting the initial spring surge may be leveling off.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. We are entering May, which typically follows the April spring surge for denim. Recent demand history shows a distinct softening from the 'Spring Surge' peaks of 140-160 units (P7-P8) to a more moderate range of 69-91 units (P9-P11). The 3-period average (P9-P11) is 77.3 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 537 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) being equal, the target service level is 0.50, meaning the base stock should ideally equal the median demand over the lead time + review period (5 periods). Using N=5 for demand captures this cooling transition from the high-demand April to late April/early May levels. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this normalization of demand (~93 units/week), and sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed: Late April demand (P9-P11) has stabilized at an average of 77 units, down 50% from the early April peak of 155 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is Ladies Denim, and historical data indicates a stabilization of demand following the spring surge. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that late April demand (P9-P11) averaged 77 units, and P12 demand just came in at 60 units, further supporting this normalization. I will set N=4 for mu_hat (covering P9-P12) to capture this recent period of lower, stabilized demand (average ~73 units over those 4 periods). This prevents over-ordering during a post-seasonal dip. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods based on P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, and P8 arrivals all reporting 4 periods. Note: Period 6's order was 0, and Period 10's order was 174 (expected to arrive in Period 14, hence why P10 conclude shows arrived=0). On-hand is 117, and pipeline is healthy at 365 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for May: average weekly demand (P9-P12) is 73 units, a significant decrease from the early April peak of 155.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/13. Recent demand history shows a clear downward shift and stabilization in May for this SKU (Ankle-length jeans). Demand over the last five periods (P9-P13) has been 91, 69, 72, 60, and 43, averaging approximately 67 units per week. This follows a peak in April (averaging ~130-150). With current on-hand inventory at 260 and 179 units in-transit (ordered P10 and P12), and a promised lead time of 4 periods consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, and P13), the pipeline of 439 units greatly exceeds the requirement for the next (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand is currently trending lower than previous averages. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand regime (post-spring peak) while maintaining the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period timing is stable. This will prevent over-ordering as the season continues to cool.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization confirmed: average weekly demand (P9-P13) has decreased to 67 units, reflecting a post-spring peak cooling in the denim category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-344.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data for this 'Ladies Denim' SKU shows a clear seasonal peak in early April (P7-P8) followed by a sustained decline and stabilization throughout May. Recent demand (P12-P14) has been 60, 43, and 45 units respectively, averaging approximately 49 units per week. The inventory position is currently very high (On-hand: 389 units) due to those larger orders placed during the April peak arriving now. With demand slowing down as summer approaches, there is substantial overstock relative to current demand levels. The lead time has remained ultra-consistent at exactly 4 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the system must avoid excess inventory. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period stabilization (N=3) to prevent the OR backend from seeing the older, higher April demand and placing unnecessary orders while the current stock of 389 units (enough for ~8 weeks) is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Late May demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand for P12-P14 has narrowed to a range of 43-60 (mean ~49), confirming a post-spring cooling period for this denim SKU.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the SKU (skinny denim) has moved past its spring peak (April) into a lower demand phase. Recent demand has stabilized: the last 4 periods (P12-P15) show demand of 60, 43, 45, and 70 (mean ~55). Profit and Holding Costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which aligns the inventory target with the median expected demand. On-hand inventory is currently high (319 units) due to arrivals from the higher-forecast orders in P10. Transitioning into June, we expect demand to remain in this lower, stable range. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current demand regime (mu ~55/week) while ignoring the April peak. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand for late May (P12-P15) has averaged 55 units, representing a sustained decrease from the April spring peak average of 133 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-94.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we observe a significant demand spike in Period 16 (115 units), which contrasts with the steady declines observed throughout late May (P13-P15 averaged 52 units). This spike likely represents early June seasonality or a localized promotion for denim. My inventory position is strong with 209 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Periods 17 through 21. Although the recent demand was 115, the 5-period average (P12-P16) is approximately 67 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering roughly one month) to capture this recent uptick while acknowledging the broader cooling trend from the April peak. This approach ensures the base stock calculation prevents excessive over-ordering if the 115 was an outlier, while still adjusting for potential June seasonality. No orders were placed in P13-P16, so the OR backend will calculate an order if the current on-hand (209) is below the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: June sentiment shift: Demand in P16 (115) broke a 4-period cooling trend (P12-P15 average: 54), suggesting a possible early summer or promotional demand increase for denim.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a June demand surge. After a cooling period in May (avg ~50), demand jumped to 115 (P16) and 148 (P17), indicating a significant regime shift, potentially due to early summer sales or specific seasonal interest in denim. The average of these last two periods is ~132. Demand is now trending closer to the April peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat to capture this recent increase specifically (N=2) to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to cover the current demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods). A recent_N of 2 for both mu and sigma will prioritize responsiveness to this sharp upward movement to prevent stockouts, given that on-hand inventory is relatively low (61) relative to current demand and the lead time.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge confirmed: Demand in P16-P17 has averaged 131.5 units, nearly matching the April peak (133) and significantly breaking the May cooling average of ~54.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Period 19). The denim SKU is experiencing a sustained June surge. Demand in P16-P18 has averaged 118 units (115, 148, 92), a significant increase from the May average of ~54. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 285 units in-transit (ordered in P17 and P18). History confirms a lead time of 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (June surge) represents a distinct shift in behavior, I am using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this recent spike while ignoring the May cooling period. This will set a higher base stock to meet the elevated summer demand and avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge confirmed: Demand for P16-P18 (mean 118) marks a sustained shift from the May cooling average of ~54, likely driven by summer seasonality for denim.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a June demand surge for this denim SKU, likely reflecting summer seasonality. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has averaged 109 units (115, 148, 92, 81), which is a significant increase from the May average of ~50. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P18 and P19 due to the recent demand spike and lead-time delay. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (based on concludes through P16). We have 450 units in transit (ordered P17, P18, P19), with the first batch of 115 units expected to arrive in Period 21. For Period 20, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture the current summer regime, and sigma_hat similarly to account for the increased volatility. The lead time (L) remains at the confirmed default of 4.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge (summer seasonality) confirmed for P16-P19: Mean increased to ~109 from the May cooling average of ~54.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 21 (July 1st). The SKU (Ladies Denim) is in a summer demand regime. Demand for P16-P20 averaged ~104 units (115, 148, 92, 81, 82). While there was a June spike, the last three periods (P18-P20) show demand stabilizing around 85 units. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 545 units. The shipment from P17 (115 units) is expected to arrive in P21 (this period's resolution) based on the confirmed lead time of 4. Orders from P18 (170) and P19 (165) follow in P22 and P23. Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods. Parameters: Setting N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent summer demand average (104) while excluding the May cooling period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the current demand volatility. Note: Stockouts in P18-P20 signify a temporary supply gap due to the June demand surge, but the pipeline (545 units) is significant and will begin arriving this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization (July): Demand for late June (P18-P20) has narrowed to 81-92 (mean ~85), following the early June spike of 115-148.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The product is Ladies Denim trousers. Demand is currently in a summer regime. Recent demand (P18-P21) has been 92, 81, 82, and 131, averaging approximately 96.5 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 430 units. Orders from P18 (170 units), P19 (165 units), and P20 (95 units) are expected in P22, P23, and P24 respectively. Inventory levels: Our current stock-out (ending inventory 0 in P21) suggests demand caught us off guard. We have 170 units arriving this period (P22) which should cover current demand. Parameters: I will set L to 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the summer demand stabilization (mean ~96.5). This results in a base stock target covering 5 periods (1+L) of demand (~482 units). With 0 on-hand and 430 in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand (July) remains strong and volatile with a recent 4-period mean of ~97 units (P18-P21), significantly higher than the May cooling average of ~54.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime. Demand in Period 22 (145 units) spiked significantly compared to the early July average of ~85, suggesting either high volatility or a mid-summer sales peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P17 arrived at P21, P18 arrived at P22). On-hand inventory is low (25 units) following the recent high demand. In-transit inventory is 313 units (ordered in P19, P20, P22), with the P19 shipment (165 units) expected to arrive in Period 23 conclude (visible in P24). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level q = 0.5. To manage the current volatility (demand range 81-145 in the last 5 weeks), I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the summer trend while hedging against the recent spike. mu_hat will be based on the (1+L) * 5-period average (average demand ~106), providing an estimated base stock that accounts for current turnover without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge (July): Demand in P22 (145) significantly exceeded the P18-P21 average of ~97 units, indicating increasing volatility or a new peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a volatile summer demand regime in July. After a period of cooling in May (avg ~54), demand surged in June/July. The last three periods (P21-P23) recorded demands of 131, 145, and 123 respectively, establishing a current demand level of approximately 133 units per week. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P21, P22, and P23). Current on-hand inventory is 67 units, and the pipeline contains 304 units (ordered in P20, P22, P23). However, the P20 order (95 units) is expected to arrive in P24, leaving the inventory position relatively tight given the (L+1) = 5 week lead time plus current period window. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) reflects the most recent July peak (avg ~133), ensuring the base stock level (1+4)*133 = 665 units is sufficient to prevent stockouts while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) confirmed: Average weekly demand for P21-P23 is 133 units, maintaining the high volatility and volume seen in early June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' (Ladies Denim) is in a mid-summer high-demand phase. Demand has been highly volatile since early June (P16). Recent demand has fluctuated between 70 and 145 units. The 3-period average (P22-P24) is 112.6, and the 5-period average (P20-P24) is 110.2. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units with 361 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current summer demand regime while smoothing out the significant weekly fluctuations. The service level target is naturally high due to the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), necessitating a base stock that robustly covers the 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility remains high: July demand (P21-P24) has ranged from 70 to 145 units (mean ~117), maintaining the elevated levels seen since early June.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' (Ladies Denim) is in a mid-summer demand regime (August 5th). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 111.4 units, though it remains volatile (ranging from 70 to 145). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. Current on-hand is low (4 units). Total pipeline (459 units) includes orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25. The P22 order (53 units) is expected to arrive this period (P26), which should resolve the immediate low stock. To maintain a steady supply through the tail end of summer, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current elevated but fluctuating demand levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, mid-summer. Recent demand (P22-P26: 145, 123, 70, 88, 120) yields a 5-period average of 109 units, showing high volatility but sustained volume compared to the May cooling period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival in P26 from the P22 order. However, there is a missing shipment from P21 (order=0, but P25 showed arrived=0, and P26 showed the P22 arrival skip P21). Wait, P21 order was 0, so arrived=0 in P25 is correct. The pipeline contains orders from P23 (156), P24 (152), P25 (98), and P26 (94), totaling 500 units. On-hand is currently 0. Given the high volatility (sigma) and 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level via the base-stock formula), I will use the recent 5-period demand average to set mu_hat, which reflects the current mid-summer regime. This ensures the OR engine maintains enough pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (August) remains volatile with a 5-period mean of 109 units (P22-P26), continuing the elevated levels established in June/July.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. This denim SKU is in a volatile summer demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 107 units with a range of 70 to 145. Recent demand in P27 was 96 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P22 arrived at P26, P23 arrived at P27). I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this mid-to-late summer volatility while accounting for the recent range. Sigma_hat will also use N=6 to provide a buffer for the observed high variance in July/August. Total pipeline + on-hand is 450 units, which covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand at the current 107 average; this is slightly lean given the lead time of 4 periods and the 1-period reporting gap, so a consistent ordering strategy based on recent averages is warranted to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late summer demand (August) has stabilized at a mean of ~107 units (P22-P27) but remains volatile (range 70-145).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The SKU is a Ladies' denim product, which has shown significant summer seasonality from June through August. Current demand (P28) is 124 units, and the recent 7-period average (P22-P28) is approximately 109 units, confirming a period of high but volatile demand compared to the May cooling period. However, as we approach late August and September, we should anticipate a potential shift from mid-summer peaks toward a stabilized late-summer/pre-fall regime. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (P24 arrived at P28 exactly on time). On-hand inventory is 88 units with 323 units in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatile summer demand regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a level that accommodates the observed mean of ~109 units per period across the (L+1) lead time window.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical data for this denim SKU shows a distinct peak in early June and late July, followed by a relatively stable but volatile August with a mean demand of approximately 107 units. Recent demand (P26-P29) has been 120, 96, 124, and 84, mirroring the late summer stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. As we move into September, denim demand typically remains steady or slightly increases for back-to-school/autumn transitions. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (P25 arrived at P29). On-hand inventory is 102, and there is a substantial pipeline (362 units). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 (since P22) to capture the late-summer behavior (mean ~109), while maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in this SKU. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period demand.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (August) remains stable with a mean of ~107 units (P22-P29) and consistent 4-period lead times.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering September 2019. Historically, late summer/early autumn demand for this denim SKU has entered a stable regime. For the last 9 periods (P22-P30), demand has averaged 103.22 units, though with notable volatility (std dev ~26). The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 26-30. On-hand inventory is 117, and in-transit inventory (P27-P30 orders) totals 336 units. This gives a total pipeline of 453 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the 9-period mean of 103, estimated total requirements are ~515 units. Our current pipeline (453) is slightly below the target of (103 * 5 = 515). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to reflect this stable but elevated late-summer average, and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture that volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without over-ordering as we move past the peak summer volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand for this denim SKU has shown distinct seasonal phases: a spring peak (April), a May cooling, and a sustained summer surge (June-August). Recent demand (P28-P31) has stabilized significantly, with values of 124, 84, 79, and 78 (mean ~91). This suggests the summer peak is transitioning into a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods (P27 order arrived at P31). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 85 units on-hand and 354 in-transit. To avoid overstocking while moving out of the peak season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P27-P31) to capture this recent stabilization and slight downward trend. This will align the base stock with the current demand level of ~90 units/week rather than the higher mid-summer average of ~117.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization: Demand in P28-P31 has narrowed to a range of 78-124 (mean ~91), indicating a transition from the volatile summer peak (June-August mean ~110) to a more stable early autumn level.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) has been 124, 84, 79, 78, and 78, showing a clear stabilization around a mean of ~89 units. This follows the highly volatile summer regime (June-August). With the summer peak concluded and the date entering late September, a more stable demand profile is expected. Lead times have been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P28 arrived at P32). Pipeline inventory (291) + On-hand (92) = 383 units. For a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a mean of ~89 and the last 5 periods for both mu and sigma calculation will provide a base stock calculation that aligns with recent stabilization while allowing the OR backend to account for the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization confirmed: P28-P32 demand has converged to a range of 78-84 (excluding the P28 outlier), establishing a new mean of ~89, down from the summer average (~110).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Historical demand for Period 28-33 shows a stabilized mean of approximately 88.3 units (excluding the P28 summer remnant of 124), with significantly reduced volatility (range 78-87) compared to the summer peak (mean ~110). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 142 units on-hand and 214 in-transit, the pipeline is healthy. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P29-P33) to capture this new autumn stability and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the lower current volatility, balancing the risk of stockouts during periodic demand spikes with the high holding cost ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed (Sept): Mean is 88.3 units (P29-P33), down from the Summer average of ~110, with a tight range of 78-87 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear stabilization in the autumn regime (Period 29-34), with demand ranging from 67 to 87 units (mean ~79). Lead times have been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P27-P30 orders arrived exactly after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is healthy at 143 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 196 units. Given the transition from the volatile summer peak (mean ~110) to a more stable autumn level, I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting (N=6 to capture the Period 29-34 stability) and the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period duration. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on previous summer spikes while maintaining sufficient service levels for the current steady demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization (October): Demand in P29-P34 has remained within a 67-87 unit range (mean ~79), confirming an further moderation from the September average of 88.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a sustained autumn demand cooling. Demand over the last five periods (P31-P35) has averaged 72.8 units (78, 78, 87, 67, 54), trending downwards. The most recent demand (P35) of 54 units suggests a further drop as we progress into October. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 153 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 188 units (orders from P32-P35: 22, 60, 50, 56). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, aiming to have inventory roughly equal to expected demand. I will set mu_hat using a recent 7-period average (P29-P35) to capture this downward stabilization (mean ~73) while maintaining a buffer for autumn volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect current variance.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand cooling: Demand has trended downwards from an average of ~88 in September to ~54 in the most recent period (P35). Overall average for P29-P35 is 73 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October, where demand has consistently cooled from the summer peak (avg ~110) and September stabilization (avg ~88) to a more moderate mid-October level. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 69 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P34-P36) have averaged 61 units. This downward trend aligns with post-summer retail patterns for denim. Current on-hand inventory is 114 units, with 202 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and moderate profit ($1.0), the objective is to avoid overstocking while managing the steady demand decline. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (69 units/period) to capture the recent cooling trend without over-reacting to a single lower dip, as the range has been stable between 54 and 87. L is set to calculated as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: October demand cooling confirmed: Weekly demand for P32-P36 has averaged 69 units, down from the September average of 88.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has entered an autumn cooling phase. Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has stabilized at a mean of 69.5 units, down from the September average (~88) and the summer peak (~110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 104 units on-hand and 173 in-transit, there is sufficient inventory to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods based on the current regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this cooling trend and set L to default (4). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target (z*=0), so the OR engine will aim to keep inventory close to the expected mean demand across the lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-autumn cooling phase for denim, moving into the pre-holiday season. Historical demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) has been [67, 54, 61, 70, 36], averaging approximately 58 units per week. This represents a significant drop from the September average of ~88. The most recent demand (36 units) may indicate a further end-of-season Dip or high volatility. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 118 and 194 units in-transit (orders from P35-P38), our total pipeline is 312. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (period 34-38) to capture the cooling trend while preparing for potential early November demand shifts. L is set to calculated as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand cooling confirmed: average weekly demand for P34-P38 dropped to 58 units, down from the September average of 88 (a ~34% reduction).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late autumn cooling phase for this denim SKU. Demand has dropped from a September mean of ~88 to a 6-period mean (P34-P39) of approximately 55 units. Recent weekly demands are 67, 54, 61, 70, 36, 41. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 133 and in-transit at 138 (total 271), and expected demand around 55 units per period, the current pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of demand (271 / 55 \u2248 4.9). To avoid excessive holding costs in a cooling market, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime and use the default calculation for lead time and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: November demand cooling confirmed: Six-period average (P34-P39) has dropped to 54.8 units, reflecting a ~38% reduction from the September average of 88.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a late autumn cooling phase for denim. Demand has stabilized at significantly lower levels compared to the summer and early autumn peaks. The last six periods (P35-P40) show demand ranging from 31 to 61, with a mean of 48.8 units. The very latest demand (P40) was 31 units, suggesting the cooling trend is potentially deepening as we move further into November. With 138 units on-hand and 106 in-transit (P37-P40), our pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling trend (approx. 49 units per period) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. This strategy aims to minimize holding costs while meeting the stabilized, lower demand.

Carry-over insight: November demand cooling confirmed: Six-period average (P35-P40) is 48.8 units, a 45% reduction from the September average of 88.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a stable low-demand period following the autumn cooling. The last 7 periods (P35-P41) show an average demand of 40.8 units, effectively half of the September average. Most recent demand (P41) was 33. We are currently in late November, leading into December. Denim typically sees a modest holiday uplift, but the primary trend currently is lower volume compared to summer/spring peaks. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P37 ordered units arrived exactly in P41). On-hand inventory (136) is high relative to current weekly demand (~40), and with 76 units in-transit (from P38-P41), the total pipeline is approximately 212 units. This covers over 5 periods of demand at current rates. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this established lower-demand regime while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time. This will likely result in small or zero orders from the OR backend to bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand regime solidified: Seven-period average (P35-P41) is 40.8 units, confirming a sustained ~50% reduction from the September peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a late autumn/early winter demand regime for denim. Demand has stabilized significantly downward from the summer peaks. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) is 40.8 units, while the most recent period (P42) saw a slight uptick to 60 units. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With 147 units on hand and 26 units in transit (ordered P39-P42), the total pipeline inventory is 173 units. Given the target service level (q = 0.5 since profit = holding cost), the base stock should roughly cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 7-period mean (~41), the desired base stock is approximately 205 units. My current inventory position (173) is below this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight variance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 9, 2019. The SKU is Ladies Denim, currently in a stable/cooling regime following the autumn period. The last 7 periods (P37-P43) have seen demand ranging from 31 to 60 units, with a mean of approximately 44 units. However, we are entering the mid-December holiday season, which often triggers a slight uptick in retail demand even for staple items like denim, though the primary trend is cooling relative to the summer/early autumn peaks. I observe that the P39 order (0 units) arrived this period (implied by lead time) or rather, no order was placed in P39, hence no arrival in P43. The current on-hand inventory is 107. P43 concluded with demand of 40. The pipeline contains 91 units (from P40, P41, P42, P43). I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) to capture the late autumn/winter stabilization mean of ~44 units per period (43.85). Setting L to default (4) as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: December/Winter demand regime identified: Mean weekly demand for P37-P43 has stabilized at ~44 units, a 50% decrease from the September average of 88.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). The denim category is currently in a sustained winter cooling phase. The demand for the last 8 periods (P37-P44) has averaged 42.9 units, significantly lower than the September average of 88. In Period 44, we observed an arrival from P40, confirming the 4-period lead time remains consistent. However, the order from Period 39 (0 units) means nothing arrived to add to on-hand inventory last period, though on-hand (79) plus current pipeline (112) is sufficient for this low-demand regime. Given the approaching end of the year and the sustained low demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stable winter regime (~43 units/period), and maintain the 4-period lead time setting. This will prevent overstocking and high holding costs during the off-season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The denim category is in a stable winter regime. Demand has been consistently low since November; the 7-period average (P39-P45) is 42.4 units, with the most recent sample at 35. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. My pipeline consists of orders from P42 (21 units), P43 (65 units), P44 (25 units), and P45 (24 units), totaling 135 units. With 45 units on-hand, the total inventory position is 180 units. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for (L+1=5) periods. Given the current mean (~42), 180 units is sufficient to cover expected demand (5 * 42 = 210) without excessive overstocking, as the backend will order the difference. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand winter regime while filtering out the higher autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed (December): Mean weekly demand for P39-P45 has stabilized at ~42 units, a significant decrease from the September peak of 88.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December 2019. The demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' has solidified into a winter regime, averaging 35.4 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) and 32.3 units over the last 3 periods (P44-P46). Retail denim demand typically stays low after the autumn peak until a pre-spring surge in February. Inventory status: 36 on-hand units plus 129 units in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P43 (65), P44 (25), P45 (24), and P46 (15). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the cooling demand and the substantial pipeline (129 units), I am using 'recent_N' for demand calculation (N=10) to reflect the contemporary winter regime while maintaining a safety buffer. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=10 to capture the recent range of 30-70 units.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed for late December (P37-P46): mean weekly demand is ~35 units, a 60% reduction from the September peak (~88). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
