Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Tilly women's t-shirt (everyday basic). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from 0 to 27 units over the last 5 weeks as we move out of mid-winter. Total in-transit and on-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to order enough to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Average demand of the last 3 samples is 17.3, but the trend is strongly positive. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current upward momentum, while keeping L at default until actual delivery performance is observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 8, 17, 27, and finally 77 in Period 1. This suggests the product is entering a growth phase or seasonal uptick as we move towards spring/summer. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 33 in-transit (ordered in P1). The promised lead time is 4. Since the on-hand is zero and demand is rapidly increasing, we need to set parameters that aggressive enough to build stock once shipments start arriving. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent high demand (avg of 17, 27, 77 = 40.33) and sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the last 3 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand has surged significantly desde mid-January, jumping from 0 to 27 by Feb 4, and then spiking to 77 in Period 1 and 143 in Period 2. This suggests a clear spring seasonal ramp-up. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 127 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the P1 order is not expected until P5. Because the demand is in a rapid growth phase, the 'default' mean (calculated over all samples including zeros) will significantly underestimate the current needs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (27, 77, 143). Given the profit/holding ratio of 1.0, the target service level is 50%, but with high volatility and zero stock, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~20 to over 100 as seasonal spring demand for basic jersey tops ramps up.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak spring season. Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend: 77, 143, 176. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 306 units in transit (ordered in P1, P2, and P3). Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, the first order (P1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. This means we must survive at least 2 more periods (P4 and P5) with 0 stock. To prepare for the arrival and future demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the high-growth phase (average ~132/week). I will use L=default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand ramp-up confirmed: P1-P3 demand (77, 143, 176) shows strong seasonal growth for jersey basics in Spring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is currently entering its peak spring season. Historical demand since the regime shift in mid-February (P1-P4) has been 77, 143, 176, and 143. This averages to approximately 135 units/week. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in P1, our first shipment is expected to arrive during P5 (this period) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 521 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Given the seasonal growth, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand regime. For mu_hat, I will set N=4 to cover the current high-demand period. For L, I will stay with the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until actual arrival data confirms otherwise. For sigma_hat, I will use N=4 to reflect the volatility seen during this ramp-up phase.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a seasonal ramp-up for a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt as Spring approaches. Current Period is 6 (Mar 18). Demand spiked significantly starting Period 1 (Feb 11) and has sustained an average of ~133 units over the last 5 weeks (77, 143, 176, 143, 129). Inventory is critical: we have 0 on-hand and are backordered because early orders (P1) were too small for the actual demand regime. One shipment of 33 units arrived in P5 (ordered P1), confirming the lead time L=4. We have 641 units in the pipeline (ordered P2-P5). To protect against the stockouts we've experienced, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime clearly separated from the 0-demand pre-February period. sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect the current volatility of this growth phase. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime for Spring basics stabilized at a mean of ~133 units/period since Feb 11.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25. The product is a Women's Jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its Spring peak demand season. Looking at the history, demand shifted at Period 1 (Feb 11) and has since stabilized with a mean of ~134 units over the last 6 periods (77, 143, 176, 143, 129, 138). While on-hand inventory is currently 0, this is due to the lead time delay; the Period 3 order (179 units) is expected to arrive during Period 7, followed by the Period 4 order (215 units) in Period 8. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals match this). To set OR parameters: L=4 (promised and confirmed). Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current Spring demand level (mu_hat = (1+4) * 134.33 = 671.6). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the volatility seen during this ramp-up phase. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period, ensuring future arrivals cover the expected ~134 units/period demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-04-01. The SKU (Tilly Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a seasonal peak period for Spring. Historical demand from Period 1 to 7 shows a significant ramp-up, averaging 143.7 units per period, with Period 7 hitting a peak of 200. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand (200) exceeded arrival (179). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). Total pipeline inventory is 493 units (from orders in P4-P7). Given the current demand trajectory and the stockout in Period 7, I need to ensure the system targets enough inventory to cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 3-7) to capture the higher seasonal mean (approx 157 units/period) rather than the long-term average. This aims to build a safety buffer for the ongoing Spring demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed: Period 7 demand (200) indicates the Spring seasonal peak for jersey basics is still climbing or at its height; previous avg of 133 is now trending closer to 160+.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak period for Spring jersey basics (April). Demand has transitioned from a mean of ~133 to ~195 over the last two periods (200 in P7, 194 in P8). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated through Period 8. With a high service level requirement (Profit/Holding cost ratio suggests q=0.5, but lead time uncertainty and stockout history necessitate a robust base stock), I will focus on the most recent demand regime. mu_hat should reflect the current peak demand of ~195 units/period multiplied by (1+L) = 5. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N to capture the volatility of this high-demand phase. I will maintain L=4 as the observed lead time matches the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels (~195 units/period) for the last 2 periods; previous rising trend has plateaued at this higher level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe that the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has stabilized at its seasonal peak demand regime. Demand over the last 3 periods has been consistently high (P7: 200, P8: 194, P9: 184), with an average of 192.6 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 566 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 963 units). The current in-transit pipeline (566) is insufficient to meet this demand, assuming the peak holds. The OR backend uses mu_hat as total demand for (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this peak mean (192.6 * 5 = 963) and variance. Although Profit/Holding ratio suggests a 50% service level (q=0.5, z=0), the capping mechanism and the specific SKU context (Everyday Basics during peak spring season) necessitate ensuring the model doesn't under-order due to the recent low-inventory stockouts influencing its perception of demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product ('Jersey Basic' T-shirt) is in its peak Spring season. Recent demand has stabilized around 180-200 units, though the P10 demand was a lower 130. Looking at the trend (194, 184, 130), demand may be beginning to soften as we move toward late Spring, or P10 was a minor outlier. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (observed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P6 arrival (27 units) was insufficient to meet the P10 demand (130). However, the pipeline inventory is 745 units (orders from P7-P10), with a large shipment of 98 units expected to arrive during P11 arrival resolution. To maintain set-service levels during this peak-to-plateau phase, I am using a recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand of the last 5 periods (mean ~168), which targets a (1+L=5) period base stock of ~840. The OR backend will order the difference between this base stock and the 745 units in transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April (2019-04-29). Analyzing recent demand, there was a clear peak in late March/early April (Periods 7-9) with demand around 180-200. However, the last two periods (P10 and P11) have shown a decline to 130 and 137 respectively. This suggests the peak of the Spring jersey basic season may have passed, transitioning towards a stabilized late-Spring level. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P7 arrived P11). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 748 units in-transit. Since we have seen two consecutive periods of lower demand (130, 137 dowm from earlier 180-200), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this cooling trend (average ~133), which prevents over-ordering as the season potentially winds down. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for Spring jersey basics subsided in mid-April; demand regime shifted from ~195 (P8-P9) to ~133 (P10-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) experienced a clear seasonal peak in late March and early April (reaching ~200 units/period). However, demand has since significantly dropped: P12 demand was 72, following a period of ~130 units. This indicates the Spring peak for this basic item is ending as we enter May. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). Current on-hand is 135 units, with a very high in-transit pipeline of 545 units (orders from P9-P12). Given the sharp drop in demand (72 units in P12), the pipeline is already more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) if demand stabilizes at this lower level. To avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3 periods (average ~93 units per period) and setting sigma_hat to recent volatility to prevent over-ordering via the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand drop confirmed: Demand for jersey basics significantly declined in late April/early May, dropping from peak levels (~195) to ~72 units (P12). Forecast should now anticipate a stabilized off-peak or transition level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. The seasonal peak for this jersey basic (Spring/early Summer) has passed. Demand in Period 12 was 72 and Period 13 was 46, confirming a significant downward shift from the previous regime of ~133 and the peak of ~195. We are now in a post-peak stabilization or transition phase. On-hand inventory is 323 and in-transit is 311 (total 634), which is substantial relative to recent demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand trend (avg of 72, 46, and slightly earlier data) to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently sufficient to cover over 6 periods of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12 (late April): Significant drop from peak (~195) to current levels (~46-72) as the Spring jersey seasonal peak concludes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has successfully transitioned from its Spring demand peak (March/April) where demand averaged ~195 units, to a significantly lower post-peak regime. Demand in the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 72, 46, and 35 units respectively, indicating a shift towards a stabilized off-peak level of approximately 45-50 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 494 units and in-transit at 105 units (total pipeline = 599), the current inventory level covers roughly 12-13 periods of current demand. As Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the median of future demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume regime while avoiding further over-ordering until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics settled into an off-peak level (avg ~51) starting late April/early May (P12-P14), down from peak levels of ~195.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) has clearly transitioned into a post-peak seasonal phase. The high-demand period associated with Spring (March-April) peaked at ~195 units/period and has significantly subsided. From Period 12 (late April) to Period 15 (late May), demand has stabilized at a much lower level: 72, 46, 35, and 49 (average ~50). Current inventory levels are extremely high (546 on-hand) compared to the current demand rate, largely due to late arrivals of orders placed during the peak demand phase. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclude messages (P11 arrived P15). With 546 units on hand and 4 in transit (total pipeline of 550), and an expected weekly demand of ~50, we have approximately 11 weeks of supply. Therefore, the goal is to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 4 periods) to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while we burn through excess stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) has transitioned from its Spring peak (~195 units/period) to a significantly lower off-peak demand regime starting around Period 12 (late April). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 52.8 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 488 units with 0 in-transit. This stock level is extremely high relative to the current demand (covering over 9 weeks). Since the holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is highly detrimental to total reward. I will use the recent off-peak demand data (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the stabilized lower demand. Given the current surplus, the OR capped policy will correctly output an order of 0 to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete naturally before more stock is ordered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics stabilized at an off-peak average of ~53 units/period (P12-P16) following the end of the Spring seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, there was a sudden and significant demand spike (237 units) compared to the previous post-peak average of ~53 units. Given the date (early June) and the product description (lightweight jersey T-shirt), this likely represents a shift into a summer demand regime or a specific promotion. The on-hand inventory has dropped from 488 to 251. There are no units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Because this spike is very recent and deviates sharply from the 'off-peak' trend observed since Period 12, I need to adjust the OR parameters to prevent a stockout if this higher demand persists. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent spike (averaging ~116) while still accounting for the lower periods, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in the transition from off-peak to this new level.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' (610776028) has entered a new significant growth phase starting in mid-June (Period 17). After stabilizing at an off-peak level of ~53 units/period following the Spring peak, demand jumped to 237 in Period 17 and 282 in Period 18. This suggests a Summer demand peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (last arrival in Period 16 from a Period 12 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 242 units in-transit (ordered P18, expected arrival P22). To respond to this current spike and maintain service levels, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the sharp upward shift in demand (avg ~194 including the last 'low' period, or focusing on the rapid jump). This methodology allows the OR engine to increase the base stock level to cover the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods at this new, higher run-rate.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected: Summer peak for jersey basics started Period 17 (June 3), with demand jumping from ~50 to 230-280+ units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has entered a Summer seasonal peak. Since Period 17 (June 3), demand has jumped significantly to an average of 238 units per period (P17: 237, P18: 282, P19: 197), compared to the previous off-peak average of ~53. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) because we stopped ordering during the Spring-to-Summer transition. While we have 627 units in-transit (ordered in P18 and P19), the 4-period lead time means these won't arrive until Period 22 and 23 respectively. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on history. To satisfy demand in the (L+1) window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this new Summer regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this peak. This will trigger the OR backend to place aggressive orders to refill the pipeline and meet the 200+ unit/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime for jersey basics confirmed: Avg demand increased to ~238 units/period starting P17 (early June). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Summer peak demand regime for SKU 610776028 (Jersey Basic T-shirts). Demand spiked in Period 17 (June 3) to 237 units and peaked at 282 in P18, followed by a slight decrease to 197 (P19) and 161 (P20). The average demand for this Summer regime (P17-P20) is approximately 219 units/period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning orders placed in P18 onwards will arrive in P22-P25. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 936 units in-transit. The in-transit units are from P18 (242), P19 (385), and P20 (309). The P18 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 21. Given the high demand and 4-period lead time, we use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the Summer peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=4 focuses the OR backend on the demand levels seen since the June 3 regime shift (237, 282, 197, 161).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P17-P20) shows an average demand of 219 units/period, significantly higher than the previous off-peak average of ~53.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Summer peak demand regime for SKU 610776028 (Womens Everyday Basis Jersey T-shirt). Demand since Period 17 (June 3) jumped to an average of ~219 units/period (237, 282, 197, 161, 116), though it has notably softened in the last two periods (161, 116). However, we are currently facing a significant stockout situation because no orders were placed between Periods 13 and 17, and the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The order placed in Period 18 is expected to arrive during Period 22 (today), but it won't be visible until the Period 22 conclude message. The current in-transit pipeline (1097 units) reflects orders from P18 (242), P19 (385), P20 (309), and P21 (161). For Period 22, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the summer regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently focused on recovering from the stockout as the pipeline begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand softened in early July (P20-P21: avg 138 vs P17-P19: avg 238), suggesting the height of the summer jersey seasonal peak may be passing.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-summer-peak phase. Demand spiked significantly starting in Period 17 (early June), averaging ~219 units/period through Period 20, but has since declined to an average of ~114 units/period over the last two periods (P21-P22). This pattern mirrors the earlier Spring seasonal peak, where demand also subsided after a heavy buying period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 arrival from P18). Currently, there is a large pipeline of 855 units in transit (ordered P19-P21) which are expected to arrive in P23, P24, and P25. With on-hand inventory at 131 and demand settling, the objective is to avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase. I will use a recent demand window of 6 periods (N=6) to capture the high-demand peak while starting to weight the recent decline, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that respects current levels without overstocking against the massive incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak for jersey basics subsided; demand transitioned from ~219 (P17-P20) to ~114 units/period (P21-P22) in early July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-peak summer phase. Following a high-demand period in June (avg ~219), demand has subsided in July (P21-P23: 116, 111, 104), establishing a new stable regime of approximately 110 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from P18 and P19. Inventory is currently high (on-hand: 412, in-transit: 470) as large orders placed during the summer peak (P19, P20) continue to arrive. The on-hand inventory already covers nearly 4 periods of the current demand level (~110). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels for the stabilized demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stability (~110 units/period) rather than the volatile summer peak data. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak for jersey basics subsided in July; demand regime stabilized at ~110 units/period (P21-P23) following mid-June peaks of >200.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-summer-peak stabilization phase. Demand spiked significantly in June (Periods 17-19) with an average of ~238 units/period but has since declined and stabilized. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has consistently hovered around 104-116 units, with an average of approximately 109 units/period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (617 units) due to large orders placed during the summer peak arriving now. Pipeline inventory stands at 161 (the order from P21). Given the current on-hand inventory already covers approximately 5.6 periods of the current demand level (~109), and another shipment is due, I will set parameters to maintain this stabilized service level while allowing the high inventory to bleed down. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand stabilization confirmed: Demand for jersey basics has stabilized at an average of ~109 units/period (P21-P24) following the mid-June summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt has clearly stabilized at a lower post-summer level. Following a peak in mid-June (P17-P19), demand has consistently decreased to an average of ~102 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), with the most recent observation being 76. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 702 units as late-season orders (from P18-P21) have finished arriving. I will set the demand parameters to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=5) to avoid over-ordering and to allow the existing inventory to deplete. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-summer-peak stabilization phase. Following the mid-June peak (Period 17-19) where demand exceeded 200, demand has declined and stabilized. Over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged approximately 98 units/period (116, 111, 104, 104, 76, 76), with a noticeable further softening to 76 units in the most recent two weeks of August. On-hand inventory is currently high at 626 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for a lead time of 4 periods and a demand mean of ~98. Specifically, with L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 490 units at the recent average), and we already have 626 on-hand with zero in-transit. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand average (last 6 periods, N=6) to ensure the backend model doesn't over-order, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics showed further softening in August (P25-P26), dropping to ~76 units/period from the late-July average of ~109.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to soften as the summer peak concludes and we enter the late-summer/pre-autumn period. Recent demand (P25-P27: 76, 76, 92) shows an average of ~81 units per period, a further decline from the late-July average of ~109. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 534) due to large orders placed during the June peak. With lead time stable at 4 periods, coverage needed is for 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory (534) covers approximately 6.5 periods of current demand (~81/period), meaning no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering further, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest softening (P25-P27), which accurately reflects the current post-peak stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics showed further softening in August (P25-P27), stabilizing at ~81 units/period after the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Historical demand shows a post-summer softening for this 'Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt. After a significant peak in June (reaching >280) and a mid-summer stabilizer (~109), demand in August (Periods 25-28) has further declined and stabilized around 87 units per period (76, 76, 92, 105). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 429 units with no units in-transit. Given a lead time L=4, we must plan for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~87 units/period, the required base stock is approximately 435 units (5 * 87). Since on-hand inventory (429) plus in-transit (0) is 429, we are very close to the target stock level, which explains why the last few periods haven't triggered new orders. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent August stabilization, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L remains at the default/promised 4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' follows distinct seasonal cycles: a Spring peak (Feb-Apr), a Summer peak (Jun-July), and now a late-summer/early-autumn stabilization. Since mid-August (Period 27), demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 85 units per period (P27-P29 demand: 92, 105, 74). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (355 units) relative to the current demand regime (~85/period), which covers over 4 periods of future demand. Consequently, my parameters aim to facilitate a 'sell-down' of existing stock to minimize holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use the recent 3 periods (P27-P29) to define the current demand mean and variance, as these reflect the most recent post-peak stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics shifted back to a stable off-peak level starting late August (Period 27), averaging ~85 units/period (P27-P29), down from the late-July average of ~109.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized since late August (Period 27).

Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 284 and 97 units in-transit (total 381), and a projected demand over the (L+1=5) period window of approximately 428 units (85.5 * 5), the current stock is slightly below the required base stock level to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-summer off-peak regime (P27-P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data confirms that demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has stabilized into a consistent off-peak regime following the summer peak. Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has averaged 81 units per period (sample: 92, 105, 74, 71, 73). There is no seasonal evidence suggesting a spike in late September. With 211 units on-hand and 144 in-transit (Total pipeline: 355), the current inventory covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~81 * 4 = 324). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable post-summer regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has stabilized at an off-peak level following the summer peak. The last few periods (P29-P32) show demand values of 74, 71, 73, and 38. While the drop to 38 in P32 might be a fluctuation, the overall trend since P27 has been an average of ~70-85 units per period. I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P27-P32) to capture this stable post-summer regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P22-P25), though no new shipments have concluded since P25 because no orders were placed between P22 and P28. Pipeline inventory is currently 204 (from orders in P29-P32), and on-hand is 173. The base stock calculation will ensure coverage for the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics further stabilized in September at approximately 70-75 units/period (P29-P31: avg 72.6), following the August off-peak stabilization of ~85.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts is in a stable off-peak/late-September regime. Recent demand samples (P29-P33) are: 74, 71, 73, 38, 81. While P32 was lower (38), the most recent demand (P33) returned to the 80s range. The current average over the last 5 periods (N=5) is approximately 67.4 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 100 and in-transit at 197 (total inventory 297), and expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period window estimated at ~337 units, current coverage is slightly thin but stabilized by the recent series of orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer demand level and avoid over-weighting the unusually low P32 data point or high summer peaks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to soften as we move deeper into autumn. Recent demand (P32-P34: 38, 81, 44) averages approximately 54 units/period, showing a decline from the September average of ~72. Given this is a staple item, demand is likely stabilizing at a low-season baseline. On-hand inventory is 145, with 148 in-transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, P34). The sum (293) comfortably covers projected demand for the next (L+1=5) periods, given the current low-season average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility (e.g., the jump to 81 in P33), and N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the historical variability of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics shifted lower in October (P32-P34), averaging ~54 units/period, down from the September average of ~73.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt, which is a foundational everyday basic. We are currently in a stabilized off-peak period. Demand for the last 4 periods (P32-P35) has been consistent: 38, 81, 44, 43 (average ~51.5). Carry-over insights confirm a shift to ~54 units/period in October. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory status: On-hand is 149, In-transit is 103 (from P32-P35 orders), totaling 252 units. Given a lead time of 4, the OR engine covers 5 periods of demand. At the current rate of ~52/period, the target base stock is roughly 260. My current total inventory (252) is very close to this requirement, so the OR engine should place a small maintenance order. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the October stabilization for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default for lead time (4 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a jersey basic t-shirt, which typically sees seasonal peaks in Spring (Feb-Apr) and Summer (June-July). We are currently in a post-summer off-peak regime. Demand has stabilized further in October; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is 41.2 units per period (38, 81, 44, 43, 40), compared to the September average of ~73. On-hand inventory is 169 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~4 periods of stock). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. With a high on-hand balance and low incoming demand, the parameters should reflect the current stabilized low-demand regime to avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs as we move further into the autumn/winter off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics reached a new lower off-peak stabilization in October (starting P32), averaging ~41 units/period (P32-P36), down from the late-September average of ~73.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a jersey basic t-shirt. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that demand for this item has significantly softened as we move further into the autumn season. The demand regime stabilized at approximately 41 units/period throughout October (P32-P36). Period 37 saw a slight uptick to 56 units, but the overall trend is a low off-peak level after the summer peak. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P33 order arriving in P37). On-hand inventory is 114 units and in-transit is 76 (from orders in P34-P37), totaling 190 units. With a lead time of 4 and current demand averaging ~44 units over the last 6 periods, 190 units covers nearly 4.3 periods of demand, which is very close to our target pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). To maintain this target without overstocking during this lower demand phase, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the stable October demand level (~44 units/period) and its associated volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the jersey basics SKU (610776028) has entered a stable late-autumn off-peak regime. Analyzing the demand from Period 32 (mid-September) to Period 38, the demand has fluctuated consistently between 38 and 56 units, with an average of 43.7 units/period. The most recent three periods (P36-P38) show demand of 40, 56, and 44, averaging 46.7 units. This indicates a minor uptick compared to the October average of 41, likely a stabilization rather than a new regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 110 and in-transit at 98 (total pipeline = 208), the system is well-positioned for the (L+1) horizon (5 * 45 \u2248 225). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn stabilization regime (P32-P38), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock based on the current ~44-45 units/period demand level. This balances the high service level required by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding overstocking as we move deeper into Q4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics stabilized in late autumn (starting P32), averaging ~44 units/period (P32-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a stable late-autumn low-demand regime. Since Period 32 (mid-September), demand has leveled off significantly compared to summer peaks. Recent demand (P32-P39) averages 48.6 units/period. The most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) show demand of 56, 44, and 43, averaging 47.7. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable late-autumn performance, providing a robust mean for the current season. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 69, with 136 units in-transit (orders from P36-P39), totaling 205 units of pipeline inventory. A base stock target for 5 periods (L+1) based on a mean of ~48 will be approximately 240 units plus safety stock. Current pipeline inventory is slightly under this target, so the parameters will trigger a replenishment order to maintain service levels for this staple item.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt has stabilized into a late-autumn/winter off-peak regime. Since Period 32 (mid-September), demand has consistently averaged approximately 44 units per period (P32-P40), with the most recent three periods (P38-P40) showing 44, 43, and 30 units respectively. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 45 units, and there are 169 units in-transit (orders from P37-P40: 28, 62, 40, 39). Given the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the service level targets the 50th percentile (median demand). I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of this current off-peak regime since Period 32, while allowing the OR backend to maintain safety stock for the minor fluctuations observed (std dev ~7-8). This ensures we cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon without over-ordering during this low-demand season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a jersey basic t-shirt which has shown distinct seasonal peaks in spring and summer, now stabilized in a late autumn off-peak regime. Demand has been very stable since Period 32 (early Oct), averaging 41.5 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P32-P41). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 39 units, with 160 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively aiming for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable late-season period for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't over-order as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt, which has shown clear seasonal fluctuations throughout the year. Demand stabilized in October/November at an average of ~44 units/period (P32-P38). However, the most recent demand in Period 42 was 61, and we are entering the holiday season. While this is a basic item, a slight uptick in volatility or demand is possible during Christmas gift-buying. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 40, and there are 126 units in-transit (orders from P39-P42). The pipeline covers approx. 3 periods of recent average demand. I will set mu_hat based on the stable late-autumn regime (last 11 periods, P32-P42) which averages 45 units/period, providing a safe base for the OR engine while it accounts for the recent 61-unit observation. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed consistently in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for jersey basics has stabilized at approximately 45 units/period during the late autumn period (P32-P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. This product (Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable late-autumn/early-winter demand regime. Since Period 32 (mid-September), demand has generally fluctuated at a lower off-peak level. Specifically, from Period 39 to Period 43, demand has been 43, 30, 34, 61, and 31, averaging 39.8 units/period. The spike to 61 in Period 42 appears to be an outlier or a minor pre-holiday fluctuation rather than a sustained shift, as Period 43 returned to 31. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 49 and 154 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 40 to 43), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand levels. I will use a recent_N approach (N=12, covering roughly 3 months of the post-September period) to capture the stabilizing demand mean around 45 while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, a lightweight basic jersey t-shirt, is in a stable late-autumn/winter off-peak regime. Demand has been consistently low since October (Period 32). In the most recent interval (P40-P44), average demand is approximately 36.6 units per period (27, 31, 61, 34, 30). Although Period 42 saw a slight uptick to 61 units, the last two periods (43 and 44) returned to lower levels (31 and 27). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (45, 46, 47), the objective is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs, especially since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1. mu_hat is set to reflect the current off-peak average of ~45 units/period (using recent_N=13 to cover the period since the late-October stabilization) to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining weeks without over-ordering.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees its lowest demand during the winter months (late November through January). Historical demand from Period 40 to 45 confirms this, with a low-volume stable regime averaging 34.6 units/period (30, 34, 61, 31, 27, 25). The outliers in Period 42 (61 units) may be due to pre-holiday shopping but the trend has since returned to sub-30 levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 55 units on-hand and 140 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 42, 43, 44, and 45), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this winter low-demand regime and maintain safety stock against minor volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime for jersey basics stabilized at ~35 units/period starting Period 40 (mid-November).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt, and demand has reached its winter low. Based on the history, demand shifted around Period 40 (mid-November) to a stable winter regime of approximately 35 units per period. Specifically, from P40 to P46, demand has been: 30, 34, 61, 31, 27, 25, 33 (average ~34.4). The outlier of 61 in P42 coincides with late November (Black Friday week), but the overall trend is low and stable. The current on-hand inventory is 50, with 112 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are in a stable winter regime, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current late-year behavior (since P40). I will use 'calculate' for L as the lead time of 4 periods has been extremely consistent throughout the game.
