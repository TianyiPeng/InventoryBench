Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11) for SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). This is an everyday fashion staple (superstretch high-waisted skinny jeans). Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of 508.6 units/week, with a declining trend from Jan (752) to early Feb (384). Given the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the review period plus the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current post-holiday baseline, which averages 508 units per period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand over the 5-period window until the first order arrives.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 2 (2019/2/18), the current item is a pair of high-waisted denim skinny jeans. We are in the early spring shopping season. In Period 1, we ordered 745 units with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Because the arrival occurs after the decision phase and there is a 1-period observation delay, we see 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message; this is expected behavior. The demand in Period 1 was 246. Looking at the five pre-game historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), the average demand was approximately 508.6 units. The Period 1 demand (246) is significantly lower than that average, possibly indicating a post-winter-clearance lull or a transition in demand. However, given we have only one data point for this new regime, I will use a conservative estimate. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (combining the last 2 historical plus the current observed period) to better reflect recent trends while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to the default to acknowledge the volatility. Lead time L is kept at the default (4). Total pipeline inventory is 745.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. History shows demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has been 246 and 296 in the last two weeks, following a pre-game sample mean of ~508 over 5 weeks. The recent demand (average ~271) is significantly lower than early January figures, likely reflecting a post-holiday/early-year lull for this basic denim item before potential spring upticks. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, no shipments placed in P1 or P2 have arrived yet (on-hand is 0, sales are 0). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to include the pre-game samples while weighting towards the lower recent demand. L is set to 'default' as we haven't reached the 4-period mark to observe actual lead time behavior yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively, based on the definition of lead time (Arrival at Period N+L). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and all customer demand has being lost so far since arrivals haven't started. Historical demand samples (before P1) were high (range 384-752), but recent realized demand in Periods 1-3 has been lower (246, 296, 222). This suggests a downward shift in demand or a transition into a late-winter/early-spring regime for denim. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent lower activity while keeping L at 'default' (4) since we haven't reached the first arrival yet to verify actual lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic denim item. Historical demand from Jan 7 - Feb 4 was significantly higher (avg ~508) than the actual demand observed in Periods 1-4 (avg ~244). This suggests a downward regime shift post-holiday/early year. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, we expect the first arrival during Period 5 (to be visible in Period 6's conclude message). Currently, on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 1913 (orders from P1, P2, P3: 745+629+539=1913). P4 ordered 0 because the OR backend likely saw the pipeline as sufficient for the forecasted demand. For Period 5, I will use recent demand (Periods 1-4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-game history is no longer representative. L is kept at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to prove otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: Mean demand dropped from ~500 to ~244 (-51%) compared to Jan-early Feb history.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Demand history shows a significant drop starting in February. The last five weeks of demand are 246, 296, 222, 212, and 180. The average demand over these 5 weeks is 231.2, which is significantly lower than the pre-game samples (avg ~508). The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we received the order from Period 1, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand has stabilized at a lower level (~231), I will use the last 5 periods (all post-game data) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents the OR engine from over-ordering based on the high January historical samples. On-hand is 565 and in-transit is 1168 (from P2 and P3 orders), which should be sufficient to cover the next few periods given the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Avg demand over last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 231.2, compared to pre-game avg of 508.6. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which has shown a consistent downward demand trend since the game started. Pre-game demand (Jan/Feb) averaged ~500, but the last 6 periods (P1-P6) averaged 222.3, and the last 3 periods (P4-P6) averaged 190.0, suggesting a stabilization at a much lower level as spring progresses. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current inventory is high: 1016 on-hand plus 539 in-transit (due P7), totaling 1555 units. Given the low demand (approx 200/period), this covers ~7.7 periods of demand, well above the L+1 (5 period) target. No orders were placed in P4-P6 to avoid overstocking. For P7, the OR backend will calculate the base stock based on L=4 and recent demand. I am using recent_6 for mu_hat (avg ~222) to reflect the post-shift reality while maintaining some buffer. With the current pipeline (1555), the OR backend will likely order 0, which is appropriate given the current oversupply and $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the lower regime: Avg demand P4-P6 is 190.0 (-62% vs pre-game stats).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-915.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 706016003 is currently in a state of high inventory (1427 units on-hand) following the arrival of large orders placed early in the game (Periods 1-3). The actual lead time has been confirmed as exactly 4 periods (promised). The demand regime has shifted significantly downward since the pre-game samples; the mean demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 208 units, compared to the initial 500+ units. Demand in Period 7 was particularly low (128 units), continuing a declining trend (246 -> 296 -> 222 -> 212 -> 180 -> 178 -> 128). With 1427 units on hand and a mean demand of ~200, we have over 7 weeks of stock, which is more than enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (total 5 periods). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand and stabilize the base stock calculation, which should result in zero additional orders being placed until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Mean demand over last 7 periods (P1-P7) is 208.8 (-59% vs pre-game). Recent trend suggests demand may be dipping below 150 units as of Period 7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim trouser. Looking at the history, demand has significantly dropped from a pre-game average of ~508 units to a current regime average of approximately 188 units (average of P1-P8). The last two periods show demand at 128 and 131 units, suggesting a further decline as we move into April. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 1,296 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (total 5 periods), and a generous forecast of 200 units/period, we would need roughly 1000 units. Since on-hand inventory (1296) exceeds the target base stock, the OR engine will naturally place zero orders. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent stabilized lower regime (N=8) to ensure the backend base stock covers 5 periods (L+1) of this lower demand, preventing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime: Mean demand for P1-P8 is 186.6. Demand in late March/early April (P7-P8) has dipped further to ~130 units, indicating a possible secondary downward shift or loss of seasonal momentum for this specific denim item.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. The product is a specific type of Skinny Denim. Historical data show a significant downward trend in demand since February. Specifically, early February demand was ~500 units, dropping to ~240 in late February/early March, and further dipping to ~125 units over the last three periods (P7-P9). This suggests the item is either losing seasonal relevance or entering a lower baseline regime. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1176 units, which is enough to cover approximately 9 periods of demand at the current rate (~130 units/week). Since the lead time is 4 periods, and we must cover L+1 (5) periods for the base stock calculation, the current on-hand inventory (plus zero in-transit) far exceeds our target safety levels. Therefore, no new orders are expected or needed. To ensure the OR backend does not over-order, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level of ~125-130 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Established secondary demand floor: Demand has stabilized at ~125-130 units per week over the last three periods (P7-P9), down from the ~220 seen in early March.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Demand for this high-waisted skinny denim item has plummeted significantly, establishing a new floor. The most recent demand (Period 10) was 55 units, a sharp drop from the ~125 average seen in Periods 7-9, and far below the pre-game average of ~500. With 1,121 units on hand and a mean demand that has averaged roughly 100 units over the last 4 periods, we have over 10 weeks of stock. The high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) makes overstocking very expensive. Since lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to drastically lower our forecasts to prevent further ordering. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend (avg ~102) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this decline. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand floor collapsed in Period 10: Demand dropped to 55 units, following a three-period plateau of ~125 units (Periods 7-9). Overall demand regime is now roughly -80% vs pre-game levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016003' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in Period 12 (April 29). Historical demand has plummeted from a pre-game average of ~500 to a current stable floor of ~55-60 units (last two periods). Total current on-hand inventory is 1,062 units, which, at the new demand rate of approximately 60 per week, represents over 17 weeks of supply. The promised lead time is 4 periods and has been confirmed by historical arrivals. Given the significant inventory surplus, the OR engine needs to stop ordering. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value based on the most recent demand (around 60/week * (1+L) = 300) to ensure the base stock calculation stays well below current on-hand + pipeline levels. Sigma_hat is set using N=3 to capture the reduced volatility of the new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: Demand for Periods 10-11 has stabilized at a low of ~57 units per week, representing a -88% decline from pre-game levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for this high-waisted denim item has undergone several downward shifts. After a severe drop to ~57 units (Periods 10-11), Period 12 saw a recovery to 121 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 941 units with 0 units in-transit. Based on the most recent secondary demand floor of ~125-130 units (established Periods 7-9) and the latest reading of 121, I am forecasting demand around this level. With L=4, the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) should cover 5 periods of demand (approx 625 units). Since current on-hand (941) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. The OR backend will naturally output an order of 0 as long as base_stock (calculated from mu_hat and sigma_hat) remains below 941. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (approx 100 units/week over 5 periods = 500) to ensure the system doesn't over-order, while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in Period 12: Demand returned to 121 units after a two-period drop to ~57 units, realigning with the April floor of ~125 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-716.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product (Skinny Denim Trousers) has experienced a significant and sustained demand drop from its pre-game levels of ~500 units to a volatile lower regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (Periods 7-13), the average demand is approximately 80 units (ranging from 45 to 131). The Period 13 demand was only 45 units. With on-hand inventory at 896 units and no in-transit orders, the inventory covers over 11 weeks of the current average demand (896 / 80 \u2248 11.2). Since the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory is far above necessary levels (the OR backend would seek to maintain roughly (1+L)*mean demand \u2248 400 units), no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime to allow the backend to correctly calculate that no order is needed while avoiding excessive stock accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in May: P13 recorded a floor of 45 units, bringing the 3-period average (P11-P13) to 75 units, significantly below the previous April floor of 125.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans. Demand has been significantly lower than pre-game averages and is currently experiencing high volatility at a very low level. The last four periods of demand (P11-P14) were 59, 121, 45, and 46, resulting in a 4-week average of 67.75 units. Despite this low demand, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 850 units, which is enough to cover over 12 weeks of demand at current rates. Given the lead time is 4 periods, my total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the required base stock level for the (L+1) horizon. No new orders have been placed since Period 3, and none are needed now. I will set the parameters using 'recent_N' to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the backend recognizes the drop in both mean and volatility, though the high on-hand inventory will naturally prevent any new orders from being placed by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (P11-P14) is highly volatile but averages ~68 units, a further decline from the April floor of ~125 fragments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a significant and sustained decline from January/February (~500 units) to a volatile May regime (Periods 11-15) averaging ~66 units. On-hand inventory is currently 791 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must forecast demand for at least 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~66 units per period, the expected demand for the next 5 periods is approximately 330 units. With 791 units on hand, the inventory position is more than double the required base stock (which covers ~330 units plus safety stock). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=5 for Periods 11-15) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the surplus. This will result in an order of 0 due to the pipeline inventory exceeding the calculated base stock. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (Periods 11-15) has stabilized at a low-volume, high-volatility average of ~66 units per week, representing an 87% decline from pre-game historical levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the demand for this skinny denim item continues to be at a significantly lower level compared to the pre-game and early-game history. The demand over the last six periods (Periods 11-16) has averaged approximately 64.6 units. Specifically, the last three periods (Periods 14-16) show extreme stability at 46, 59, and 58 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 733 units, which, at the current demand rate (~65 units/week), covers approximately 11 weeks of sales. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we are effectively covered for (L+1) = 5 periods twice over. The primary objective now is to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand remains depressed, as the service level risk is zero. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 6 periods to reflect this low-volume regime and rely on the OR backend's capped policy to prevent any new orders until the inventory levels align with demand.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime continues the low-volume pattern observed in May: Avg demand Periods 11-16 is 64.7 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) averaging 54.3 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (Skinny Denim) continues to experience a significantly lower demand regime compared to pre-game data and the initial March performance. Over the last 7 periods (Periods 11-17), demand has stabilized at a low-volume, high-volatility average of ~61.9 units. The last three periods specifically show a tight range of 45-59 units. The on-hand inventory is 688 units, which covers over 11 weeks of current demand (688 / 62), well beyond the promised lead time of 4 periods (L+1 = 5). No further orders are currently necessary. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the trailing 7-period regime (N=7) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the current low-velocity sales while the system draws down the existing excess inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Inventory is very high (662 units) relative to recent demand trends. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a new low of 26 units in Period 18. The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is 47 units, and the average for the broader 'summer' regime (P11-P18) is approximately 60 units. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand, the system does not need to place new orders. To prevent the OR backend from ordering due to outdated statistical averages (which are heavily skewed by early-game demand of ~500), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (P11-P18) to reflect the current low-volume reality. No new orders will be generated by the backend because on-hand inventory (662) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock for a 4-period lead time at these demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new low of 26 units in Period 18; the June regime (P17-P18) average is 35.5 units, continuing the long-term downward trend from the April/May levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has consistently declined throughout the game, with a significant downward trend observed as we enter the summer months (late June). Demand in the last two periods (P18-P19) has dropped to a new floor of approximately 22-26 units. Current on-hand inventory is 640 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~24 units/week), providing over 25 weeks of cover. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will correctly observe that on-hand (640) + in-transit (0) far exceeds the base stock calculated from even the most optimistic demand forecasts, resulting in zero new orders. To ensure the backend uses the most relevant recent data for this calculation, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the June slump (22-45 units range). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime (P17-P19) has reached its lowest point, averaging 31 units per week, continuing the significant decline from the April floor of 125 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016003 (Skinny Denim) has entered a severe downward trend as we move into July, with Period 20 reaching an all-time low of 15 units. This is consistent with a seasonal decline for high-waisted denim as summer temperatures peak. The June average (P17-P20) is only 27 units, and current on-hand inventory is 625 units, which provides over 23 weeks of coverage at current demand rates. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory surplus, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this latest demand collapse, which ensures the OR backend's 'base stock' calculation remains far below our current on-hand levels, thus preventing unnecessary ordering while incurring the $1.00 holding cost on the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (Period 20) hit a new low of 15 units; June/early July average (P17-P20) is 27 units, confirming a continued decline from the April floor of 125 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for this SKU has seen a continuous and significant downward trend since the game started, collapsing from an initial ~250 units/week in February to an average of just 19.3 units over the last four periods (P18-P21). On-hand inventory is currently 604 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must consider demand for L+1 (5 periods). Even using the higher April/May floor of ~60 units, our 604 units on-hand would last 10 periods; at the current July rate of ~20 units, it covers over 30 periods. Our primary objective is to stop ordering and allow the system to bleed off this excess inventory to minimize holding costs, which are $1.0 per unit/period (high relative to $4.0 profit). I will set L to 'calculate' based on history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to accurately reflect the extremely low current demand regime (~19 units/week) to ensure the base stock calculation remains lower than our current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any new orders.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P18-P21) has stabilized at a new historical low, averaging 19.3 units per week, continuing the downward trajectory from the June average of 31 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (Jeans) continues to exhibit a sustained long-term decline in demand. Recent demand in July (Periods 20-22: 15, 21, 34) averages 23.3 units per week. Although Period 22 saw a slight increase to 34 units, the overall trend remains significantly lower than the April (avg ~125) and May (avg ~66) levels. On-hand inventory is 570 units, which, even at a conservative demand estimate of 35 units per week, covers over 16 periods. Given the promised lead time (L=4) plus current review period, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated as [L+1] * mu_hat) is vastly exceeded by the current on-hand inventory. No ordering is required. To prevent any erroneous ordering while the current excess stock is depleted, I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg ~21.6 units). This ensures the base stock target remains well below current on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P21-P22) shows a slight uptick but remains low, averaging 27.5 units, confirming a continued trough compared to June's 31-unit average.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016003' (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a high-inventory, low-demand environment. The current period is 2019-07-22. History shows demand peaked in Feb/March (~200+ units) and has steadily declined through June (~30 units). Period 23 saw a sudden spike to 102 units, but current on-hand inventory is 468 units, which is significantly more than any plausible lead-time demand (L=4). Specifically, even at the high demand of 100 units/week, 468 units covers over 4 weeks of sales. Given a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. The current inventory is already well above the required base stock level to satisfy an 80% service level. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P19-P23) to reflect the recent low-volume regime (averaging approx 38.8 units/week), while relying on the 'cap' and 'base stock' logic which will see that 468 units on-hand exceeds (1+L)*mean + z*sigma.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand volatility spike in Period 23 (102 units) after a long-term decline to ~20 units; however, on-hand inventory (468) remains excessive for current demand levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained period of excess inventory. Although demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (P23: 102 units, P24: 171 units), likely due to a summer-clearing or seasonal shift, the current on-hand inventory of 297 units remains high relative to previous months' lows. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must provide parameters for a 5-period horizon (L+1). Even at the recent high-demand average of ~136 units/week (P23-P24), 297 units cover over 2 weeks of supply. Given the long-term downward trend prior to this recent spike and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the goal is to naturally draw down inventory until it reaches a level closer to the safety stock required by the new demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge without over-ordering, as the system's cap and current pipeline will likely result in a zero order for now, which is optimal for liquidating old stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late July (Periods 23-24), with a 2-period average of 136.5 units, reversing the previous low-volume trough of ~20-30 units observed in June/early July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016003 (Skinny Denim) has undergone a dramatic trend reversal. After a long-term decline reaching a low of ~20 units in June/early July, demand has surged over the last three periods: 102 (P23), 171 (P24), and 246 (P25). This aligns with the 'Back to School' shopping season starting in August, which typically drives demand for staple denim products. Specifically, the average demand over the last three periods is ~173 units, and the most recent demand reached 246, which is identical to the demand seen in Period 1 (February). Given the current on-hand inventory of 51 units and lead time of 4 periods, there is a risk of stockouts if this seasonal spike continues. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this sharp upward trend (L+1 * ~173), and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the high recent volatility. I will maintain L=default as the promised lead time of 4 has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand recovery confirmed: P23-P25 average is 173 units, a 6x increase from the June/July trough of ~27 units, driven by August 'Back to School' seasonality.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly due to August Back-to-School seasonality (Periods 23-26: 102, 171, 246, 213). Period 26 demand (213) resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). I have 508 units in transit (ordered P25 and P26), and with a promised lead time of 4, the P25 order (216 units) is expected to arrive in Period 29. I must now maintain higher base stock levels to support this recovered seasonal demand. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as the history shows reliability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the high-volume August regime (avg ~183/week, which is 5x higher than the June trough). For sigma_hat, I also use recent_N=4 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand recovery confirmed: August demand (P23-P26) averages 183 units, a massive increase from the June/July average of ~20-30 units, matching Back-to-School patterns for denim.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak 'Back-to-School' season for denim products (mid-August). Demand has surged significantly from a June/July trough of ~20-30 units to an August average of 183 units (P23-P26). Period 27 demand was 160 units, confirming the higher regime is sustained despite stockouts. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 794 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 25, 26, and 27). The first batch (216 units ordered P25) is expected to arrive in Period 29 (L=4). To set parameters, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand seasonal regime while smoothing the volatility observed during the late July spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance seen during this transition. L is kept at default (promised 4) as historical arrivals consistently confirm a 4-period lead time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) during a period of high demand driven by Back-to-School seasonality (Late August). Demand in Period 28 spiked significantly to 344 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 240.75 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime compared to the summer trough. The order from Period 25 (216 units) is expected to arrive in Period 29's arrival phase (since L=4), but it is not yet visible in the 'conclude' message. Total pipeline inventory is 996 units (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). I will set L to 'default' (4) as lead times have been consistent. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high seasonal demand (Avg ~241) and project it across the lead time (1+4 periods). sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' N=4 to account for the high volatility seen in the August demand recovery.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: Late August (P28) demand surged to 344 units; P25-P28 average is 241 units, a baseline shift from the early August average of 183 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in its Back-to-School seasonal peak. Period 29 demand was 264, following a surge to 344 in Period 28. The 4-period average (P26-P29) is approximately 245 units. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, despite 216 units arriving in P29 (all were sold to meet partial demand). The current pipeline contains orders from P26 (292), P27 (286), P28 (202), and P29 (354), totaling 1134 units. The first of these (292 units) is expected to arrive in Period 30, which will alleviate the current stockout. I am setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=4 (Periods 26-29) to capture the current high-demand seasonal regime (~245 units per week). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the high volatility seen during this peak (ranging from 160 to 344). This positioning ensures the OR backend attempts to maintain a base stock sufficient for the current seasonal level while considering the large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak sustained: Late August/Early September (P26-P29) demand averages ~245 units, maintaining the seasonal baseline shift from early August.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 is experiencing a sustained high-demand period consistent with Back-to-School seasonality (late August to early September). The most recent four periods (P27-P30) show demand values of 160, 344, 264, and 173, averaging 235.25 units per week. Although demand dipped to 173 in P30, this remains substantially higher than the summer trough (~20-30 units) and aligns with the seasonal baseline established in early August. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P25 and P26 arriving exactly on time. With only 119 units on hand and a high pipeline of 1082 (orders from P27-P30), we are currently in a heavy replenishment phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current seasonal average (approx. 235 * 5 = 1175 for the review+lead period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime (P27-P30) confirmed with an average of ~235 units, though volatility is high (range 160-344).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in its 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak. While demand reached a high of 344 in late August (Period 28), it has recently cooled to 173 (Period 30) and 127 (Period 31), following the trend seen in the pre-game history where January demand was higher than February. The period 27-31 average demand is approximately 213 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 29, 30, and 31. On-hand inventory is 278 and in-transit is 934, totaling 1212 units. Given the target service level (80%) and the observed downward cooling from the peak, the current pipeline is significant. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the seasonal average while acknowledging the recent deceleration, and use a recent_N sigma to account for the high volatility (127 to 344 range) observed during this peak window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak reached its maximum in late August (P28: 344 units) and has begun decelerating in September (P31: 127 units), matching the historical profile of early-year demand being higher than late-winter demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School seasonal peak (August) for this denim product is concluding, with demand decelerating in September (from 344 in Period 28 to 88 in Period 32). Current inventory (On-hand: 392, In-transit: 756) is very high relative to the most recent demand of 88 units. With a 4-period lead time, the pipeline inventory already covers more than 8 periods of current demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs during this post-peak period, I am using a recent_N (N=4) method for mu_hat to capture the recent deceleration (average 163 units/period) and sigma_hat (standard deviation roughly 80 across that period). L is maintained at the promised value of 4 periods, which is consistent with all concluded observations (P29-P32). The OR backend will likely generate minimal or zero orders given the high pipeline (756 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped from a peak of 344 (P28) to 88 (P32), matching historical patterns of tapering after the August surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged unexpectedly to 881 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the recent post-Back-to-School deceleration (P32: 88 units) and even the peak seasonal demand (P28: 344 units). This surge has completely depleted the on-hand inventory. The product is a skinny denim jean, and we are entering October; while there may be secondary seasonal effects or promotional events, 881 is more than double any previous peak. However, we must react to prevent stockouts while honoring the high holding cost ($1.00 vs $4.00 profit). On-hand is currently 0, and in-transit is 402 units (orders from P30-P32). Given the extreme volatility and the stockout, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I will project a moderate mean of 200 units per week to balance the risk of another surge against the high holding cost of overstocking, as the 881 spike is likely a non-sustained anomaly. Sigma_hat is set high (explicit 150) to account for this massive historical variance. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand anomaly detected in P33 (881 units), deviating from the post-Back-to-School trend of ~100 units. Monitoring for potential October promotional spikes or sustained regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $960.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 and 34, we observed massive demand spikes (881 and 590 units respectively). This deviates significantly from the post-Back-to-School tapering observed in early September. This pattern likely represents an October promotional event or a new seasonal peak for this denim SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 609 units in transit (138 from P31, 24 from P32, 0 from P33, 447 from P34). The P31 order (138 units) is expected to arrive this period (P35), followed by the P32 order (24 units) in P36. To address the stockouts caused by these spikes, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2500 (representing a weekly forecast of 500 units over L+1 periods, where L=4). This aggressive forecast accounts for the possibility that the ~600-800 unit demand level persists or tapers slightly but remains much higher than the previous baseline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand surge confirmed: Period 33-34 demand averaged 735.5 units, a massive spike compared to the September average of ~140, indicating a major seasonal event or promotion.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, demand was 338 units, confirming that while the extreme 800+ spike in P33 was an anomaly, the current October demand regime is significantly elevated (averaging ~603 units over P33-P35) compared to the September baseline of ~140. I am currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline inventory is 1545 units (ordered in Periods 32, 34, and 35). Based on 'Period 35 conclude', the order from Period 31 arrived with a lead time of 4 periods, confirming L=4 remains stable. To address the stockout and the high October demand, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the current high-demand regime. Using the average of the last 3 periods (P33-P35) given the major shift: (881+590+338)/3 = 603. Thus, mu_hat = (1+L) * 603 = 3015. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 400 to reflect the intense volatility observed during this October surge. This aggressive base stock targets a recovery from the stockout while acknowledging the higher demand floor.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand (P33-P35) is ~603 units, a ~330% increase from the September average of ~140 units, indicating a sustained seasonal peak or promotion.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a massive October surge, significantly outstripping historical early-year levels and even the Back-to-School peak. Over the last four periods (P33-P36), demand has been 881, 590, 338, and 407 units respectively. The average for this specific October regime is approximately 554 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing significant stockouts (only 24 units sold against a demand of 407 in Period 36). The pipeline inventory of 2419 units reflects aggressive orders placed in recent periods (P34-P36) designed to capture this surge. Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, these units will only begin arriving in Period 38 (P34 order). My goal is to set parameters that maintain a high base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) to satisfy this elevated demand regime and ensure the OR backend continues to authorize sufficient ordering to replenish depleted stock levels as they arrive. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime while including the initial 881 peak.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand (P33-P36) is ~554 units, a sustained ~300% increase from the September baseline, despite stockout-limited sales data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained October/November demand surge (potential Fall/Winter transition or mid-season promotion). Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand has averaged approximately 537 units per week, significantly higher than the September average of ~140 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, with 3227 units in-transit. An order of 447 units from Period 34 is expected to arrive this period (P38) based on the consistent 4-period lead time. However, to maintain a high service level for the remaining 10 periods of the game given the high demand (avg ~537) and lead time (4 periods), the base stock must be robust. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the surge period) to capture the current high-demand regime and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: October/November demand regime shift sustained (P33-P37): Average demand is 537.2 units, a 280% increase from the September average (~140). Forecast should prioritize this high-volume regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. The SKU 706016003 (high-waisted denim) has entered a high-demand regime since Period 33 (late September), likely driven by October promotions or early holiday shopping. Average demand from P33 to P38 is 523.5 units. Recent demand has slightly moderated to ~460 in P37-P38 but remains significantly elevated above the September baseline of ~140. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and the system is reliant on pipeline arrivals. The order from Period 35 (1074 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P39), as lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods. With In-transit inventory at 2780 units, including the large orders from Periods 35, 36, and 37 (totaling 2780), the current pipeline is theoretically sufficient to cover demand for the next (L+1) periods if the current regime persists. No new order is needed this period because the pipeline inventory (2780) is already close to or exceeding the target base stock based on the recent high-volume regime (523.5 * 5 = 2617.5). Re-setting L to 4 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the last 6 periods of high activity.

Carry-over insight: October/November high-demand regime (P33-P38) average has stabilized at 523.5 units, confirming a massive seasonal or promotional baseline shift.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime observed from Period 33 to Period 38 (averaging ~523 units) saw a significant drop in Period 39 to 246 units. This drop is consistent with the end of a seasonal peak or promotion. However, demand remained higher than the September baseline (~140). Given the high on-hand inventory (828 units) and substantial in-transit volume (1909 units), the priority is to avoid over-ordering as the season likely winds down in November. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 6 to capture the high-demand peak while incorporating the recent deceleration, providing a balanced forecast for the remaining lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in Period 39: Demand dropped to 246 units from a 6-period average of 523 units, suggesting the end of the October/November peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016003 (Skinny Denim) has shown a clear deceleration over the last two periods (P39: 246, P40: 302) following a massive October/November peak that averaged over 500 units. The current on-hand inventory is 1424, and there is an additional 1011 units in-transit (808 from P37, 203 from P39). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, these in-transit units will arrive in P41 and P43 respectively. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 2435) already covers over 8 periods of demand at the recent average rate (~300 units/week). To avoid excessive holding costs as the season wind down, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent deceleration (N=2) to prevent the OR backend from triggering additional orders based on the previous higher average.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in November: Average demand over P39-P40 is 274 units, down from the October/early November average of 523 units (-48% shift).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016003 has confirmed a significant deceleration from the October high-demand regime (~530 units) to a new November baseline. Periods 39-41 show demand of 246, 302, and 274 units respectively, averaging 274 units. This represents a roughly 50% drop from the previous peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 1,958 units due to large orders placed during the October surge (Periods 35-37) finally arriving. With an expected weekly demand of ~274 units, the current on-hand inventory alone covers over 7 periods of supply. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand 1958 + in-transit 203 = 2161) is excessive. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (N=3) to guide the OR engine toward this lower demand level, which will naturally result in zero new orders being placed given the safety stock and inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Demand has moderated to an average of 274 units (P39-P41), confirming the end of the ~530 unit October peak regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand surged to 627 units, likely representing a Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (Nov 25th-Dec 2nd context). This follows a three-period stabilization at ~274 units. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is very high (1331 units), covering approximately 4.8 weeks of the previous 'normal' November demand (~274) or 2.1 weeks of the recent peak demand. Total inventory (on-hand 1331 + in-transit 203 = 1534) is substantial. Given we are at Period 43 of 47, there are only 4 periods left. The current inventory position is sufficient to cover the remaining game periods even if the high-demand regime persists. Calculating mu_hat using recent_N=4 captures the transition from the mid-November lull to the late-November spike (average ~362 units), which safely prevents over-ordering while maintaining service levels for the final weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late November demand spike detected (Period 42: 627 units), likely associated with Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonal peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in the early December period. Recent demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (627 units), clearly corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a sharp drop to 143 units in Period 43. This pattern mirrors the transition from the peak holiday shopping season into a more stable December volume. The current on-hand inventory is 1,391 units with 613 in-transit (set to arrive in P47). Given the current date (Dec 9) and the game end at Period 47, we are entering the final lead-time window. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a more realistic demand baseline for the remaining December periods, recognizing that the Black Friday surge was a one-off event. I will use a 3-period average (P41-P43) which captures the holiday peak and the subsequent drop, yielding a mean of ~348 units. This reflects both the residual holiday demand and the return to baseline, protecting against a possible late-December 'gift-giving' lift while acknowledging high current stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped from 627 (P42) to 143 (P43). Current regime (P41-P43) average is 348 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (mid-December) shows demand returning to a more moderate level (283 units) following the Black Friday spike (627 units) and subsequent dip. The current average demand for the post-peak November/December period (Periods 39-44, excluding the Black Friday outlier) is approximately 250 units. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, my primary goal is to manage the existing 1108 units on-hand and the 821 units in-transit (total 1929 units) to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs for the remaining 3 weeks. Given the expected demand of ~250 units per week, the total remaining demand is roughly 750 units. The current total inventory (1929) is significantly higher than this requirement. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent baseline (approx 250 units/week) to ensure the system doesn't trigger unnecessary orders and focuses on clearing the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: December demand stabilization: Following the Black Friday spike, demand has stabilized around ~280 units (Period 44), consistent with the post-October peak baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 23 (Period 46). Demand has stabilized following the late November (Black Friday) spike. The last five periods (P41-P45) show demands of 274, 627, 143, 283, and 247. Excluding the outlier of 627, the average is roughly 237. The current on-hand inventory is 861 and in-transit is 821, totaling 1,682 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At a high-end average of 250 units/period, we only need ~1,250 units. We are currently overstocked by approximately 400 units given the expected post-holiday deceleration. No new orders are needed. L remains 4 based on consistent arrivals from P39-P41. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-peak stabilization while accounting for the high volatility seen in P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-416.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a post-holiday demand deceleration phase. The recent demand for P46 was 89 units, significantly lower than the December average (~230). The current inventory position is very high: 772 units on-hand and 1058 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P46). The order from Period 43 (613 units) is expected to arrive this period (P47), and the order from Period 44 (208 units) in Period 48. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. Even at a conservative estimate of 200 units/week, we need 1000 units total. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 1830 units, which is a massive surplus. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-holiday stabilization (average of last 8 periods ~265) and leave sigma_hat at default to handle volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed: Period 46 demand dropped to 89 units; December average (P44-P46) is ~206 units, down from the November average of ~348 units.
