Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Lennox V-neck blouse'. Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear ramp-up: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29. This suggests the product has recently transitioned from 'pre-launch' to 'active' or seasonal launch. Since we are in mid-February, we are approaching the Spring fashion season. The last two weeks average 38 units. Demand is volatile but growing. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Given the lead time, orders placed now cover demand 4-5 weeks ahead (mid-March). I will use the recent 3 weeks (N=3) of non-zero demand [14, 47, 29] to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the '0' values from early January are likely non-representative of the active status. Setting N=3 for demand parameters (mean=[14+47+29]/3 = 30; \u03bc\u0302 = (1+4)*30 = 150) and using default for the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's v-neck blouse. Historical demand shows 0, 0, 14, 47, 29, and Period 1 demand was 16. The average demand across these 6 points is approximately 17.6 units/week. Since the period is mid-February, we are moving into the spring fashion season, which typically sees steady demand for transition pieces like blouses. Our current on-hand is 0, and we have 58 units in-transit from Period 1. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the order placed in Period 1 (58 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5. We need to set parameters to cover demand for the lead time (4) + review period (1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat captures the active demand phase (Feb onwards), giving a mean of approximately 27.25 ((47+29+16+17)/4, approximated). To be conservative on this early-stage item and avoid excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current active demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's V-neck blouse, which belongs to the Everyday Collection but may see increased demand as spring approaches. Historical demand (post-Jan startup) shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29 (pre-game samples) followed by 16 and 23 in Periods 1 and 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 (total 110 units in-transit) have not arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 4 periods. The first arrival (from P1) is expected during Period 5. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent activity (47, 29, 16, 23), which averages 28.75 per period. Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+L)*28.75 = 143.75. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of these four samples is approximately 13.2, so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+4)*13.2 = 29.5. I am sticking to the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's v-neck blouse. Historical demand shows a slow start (0s in Jan) followed by a rise in late Jan/early Feb (14, 47, 29). During the game periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25), demand was 16, 23, and 12. Total mean demand across all 8 available samples is approximately 17.6 units. The promised lead time is 4. No units have arrived yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time (orders from P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 and be visible in the P6 START message). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 161 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods. With L=4, we need (1+4)=5 periods of coverage. Mean demand (17.6) * 5 = 88. However, the 'recent_N' samples (last 3 game periods) average 17. The OR engine will subtract the 161 in-transit units from the base stock calculated from mu_hat. Since in-transit (161) is already much higher than the expected demand for the lead time (88), the engine will likely not order more. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the game-time demand levels which are slightly lower than the late January peak.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'V-neck blouse in an airy weave', which is suitable for spring. Since late January, we've seen demand samples: 14, 47, 29 (pre-game) followed by 16, 23, 12, 42 during gameplay. The demand is currently volatile but averaging around 26 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we placed the first order in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 161 units are in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 5, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations (avg ~23). With L=4, the backend needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. mu_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) and L as default (4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the high coefficient of variation seen recently.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's V-neck blouse. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29 (pre-game) followed by 16, 23, 12, 42, 45 (game periods). The last two weeks (42, 45) suggest a stabilization at a higher demand level compared to the start of the year, likely due to spring seasonality for blouses. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). With on-hand at 13 and in-transit at 103, pipeline inventory is 116. Given the trend, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand (avg 33/week) while smoothing out the volatility. Sigma_hat will use all available game data (N=5) to ensure sufficient safety stock for the observed variance. The backend base stock calculation will account for the lead time L=4 and the (1+L) factor.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift starting around late January/early February. Looking at the last 5 periods (P2-P6), the demand values are 23, 12, 42, 45, and 44. Excluding the dip in P3, there is a sustained increase in demand to an average of approximately 43.6 units per period over the last 3 weeks (P4-P6), compared to the earlier baseline. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 21, with 109 units in transit (51 from P3, 58 from P6). Since demand has stabilized at a higher level, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new baseline. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P4: average weekly demand increased to ~43 units compared to P1-P3 avg of ~17 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting in Period 4 (March 4th), moving from an average of ~17 units to ~47 units over the last four periods (42, 45, 44, 56). This increase aligns with the transition into spring for a 'V-neck blouse in an airy weave', suggesting a seasonal uptick. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived exactly in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). On-hand inventory is low (16 units) due to the demand surge, while 105 units are in-transit (orders from P6 and P7). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean (approx 47 units/week) and the recent volatility across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4 confirmed: avg increased from ~17 to ~47 (+176%) coinciding with Spring seasonality for blouses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand spiked significantly in Period 8 (81 units), confirming a strong upward trend for this v-neck blouse as spring progresses. The demand regime shifted at Period 4, and since then (P4-P8), the average demand is 53.6 units/period, compared to the initial average of 17. The Period 1-3 orders arrived with a stable lead time of 4 periods. However, the order from Period 4 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' in Period 8. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 163 units in-transit (from orders in P6, P7, and P8). To address the recent spike and the stockout in P8, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P4-P8) to capture the higher demand regime, and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~16.5). L remains at the default promised 4 periods as observed arrivals match this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8 demand peaked at 81 units, elevating the post-P4 average to 53.6 units/week. Volatility has also increased significantly alongside volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product (V-neck blouse) is in a high-demand spring regime. Looking at historical demand, there was a clear shift starting Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is 51.5 units/week (42, 45, 44, 56, 81, 41), compared to the Period 1-3 average of 17. The peak in Period 8 (81 units) suggests high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 8 and 9. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1, P2, and P3 arrivals). Orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9 are in-transit (58+47+58+81 = 244 units). The P6 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P10) and be visible in P11. To capture the current demand regime and its high volatility, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N covers the entire high-demand period since P4. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target cycle service level is 80%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a women's blouse, which has shown a clear demand regime shift since Period 4 (early March), likely driven by Spring seasonality. The post-shift average demand (P4-P10) is 50.0 units per week, compared to the initial 17.0 units. Recently, demand has stabilized between 40-41 units after a peak of 81 in P8. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, and P10 arrivals all show lead_time=4). There is a significant pipeline of 229 units. Note that the order from P7 (47 units) is expected to arrive this period (P11), and the P8 order (58 units) in P12. My goal is to maintain the service level while managing this heavy pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the Spring demand regime (avg ~50), and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the P8 spike (std ~15.5, which converts to ~38.8 over L+1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting P4 (March), correlating with Spring seasonality for blouses. Average demand since P4 (excluding P11 which shows a potential cooldown) is approximately 47 units. P11 demand dropped to 28, suggesting the peak might be passing, but as we are still in Spring, we must maintain robust coverage. Observed lead times for P1, P2, P3, P6, and P7 are all exactly 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time is stable. Period 4 and 5 had no orders, and Periods 8 and 9 orders are still in transit (expected to arrive in P12 and P13 respectively). For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 8 (P4-P11) to capture the high-demand Spring regime while accounting for the recent P11 dip. This balances the 81 unit spike with the more moderate 40s and the recent 28. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=8 to reflect the high volatility (12 to 81 range) seen in this regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which saw a significant demand surge starting in early March (Period 4), consistent with Spring seasonality. Demand has stabilized recently, averaging approximately 38 units over the last 3 periods (P10-P12), down from the peak of 81 in Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by orders from P6, P7, and P8 arriving exactly 4 periods later in P10, P11, and P12. Currently, there are 52 units on hand and 171 units in transit (ordered in P9, P10, P11, P12). The pipeline is quite full due to the large order of 81 units in P9 (expected arrival P13). I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime starting at Period 4, while keeping the lead time method at default 4 as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Spring shift (P4-P12) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~48 units/week compared to early periods, though recent weeks (P10-P12) show a slight cooling to ~37 units/week. Lead time is strictly 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This SKU (Womens V-neck blouse) transitioned to a higher demand regime in early March (P4), likely following Spring seasonality. Looking at the last 10 periods (P4-P13), the average demand is 48.2 units/week. However, the most recent 4 periods (P10-P13) show a more stabilized and slightly lower mean of 38.25 units/week. The spike in P8 (81 units) appears to be an outlier during the peak of the Spring transition. I am setting N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader sustained Spring regime while smoothing the P8 outlier, and N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the elevated volatility observed since P4. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, and P13 conclude messages). With 91 units on hand and 129 in transit (total 220), and a targeted base stock based on a weekly mean of ~48, the system is well-stocked for the 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Spring peak: P10-P13 average demand is ~38 units/week, down from the P4-P9 average of ~55 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, we saw a demand surge in March and April (Spring peak), with demand reaching as high as 81 units. However, recent demand (P10-P14) has stabilized around a mean of 40 units/week (40, 28, 43, 42, 47). The Carry-over insight from Period 14 correctly noted this cooling. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 87 and in-transit is 124. For Period 15, I will use a N=5 period lookback for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the post-peak stability (Avg ~40). This prevents over-ordering based on the high Spring peak while maintaining sufficient stock for the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are past the initial Spring peak (March/April). Demand has stabilized into a moderately high regime. In the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand has averaged 42 units/week (40, 28, 43, 42, 47, 52), showing a steady upward crawl from the slight dip in P11. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My OR parameters aim to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With On-hand = 70 and In-transit = 92, the total pipeline is 162 units. Covering 5 periods at an average of 42 units requires roughly 210 units. I am using recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the current stable-but-creeping demand environment without being skewed by the very early low-demand periods or the isolated peak in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spring peak has stabilized at a new baseline; the 6-period average (P10-P15) is 42 units/week with moderate variance (\u03c3 \u2248 8). Lead time reliability is high at exactly 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Lennox V-neck blouse' has exited its high-growth Spring peak and entered a more stable demand regime. Since Period 10, mean demand has hovered around 41.5 units/week. Recent samples (P14-P16) specifically show demands of 47, 52, and 44, indicating a slight upward creep but remaining consistent with a baseline in the low 40s. The lead time remains highly reliable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival from P5 through P16. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak stability (P10-P16) while ensuring the OR backend targets sufficient stock for 5 periods (L+1) of demand. On-hand is 38 and in-transit is 136; with lead time 4, these 136 units (ordered P13-P16) are scheduled to arrive during P17, P18, P19, and P20 respectively, effectively covering the pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's v-neck blouse. Demand has stabilized following the spring peak. Looking at the last 8 periods (P10-P17), the average weekly demand is approximately 40.4 units (40, 28, 43, 42, 47, 52, 44, 27). The most recent period (P17) showed a dip to 27 units, but previous weeks remained relatively consistent in the 40-50 range. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture this post-peak stability, which results in a weekly average of ~40 units. With a lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend targets (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, on-hand is 50 and in-transit is 149, totaling 199 units. This pipeline is sufficient since 5 periods * 40 units = 200 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), we are in mid-June, following a stabilized demand period after the Spring peak. Demand over the last 9 periods (P10-P18) has averaged approximately 41 units/week, with the last 3 periods (P16-P18) averaging 38 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 45 units, and in-transit inventory is 131 units (orders from P15/P16/P17/P18). Total pipeline + on-hand is 176 units, which covers approximately 4.3 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given the status as a summer blouse, we expect demand to remain relatively steady or slightly decline as the season progresses. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the post-spring stabilization mean and variance, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period exposure window while being mindful of holding costs ($1/unit vs $4 profit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-seasonality transition (P10-P18) has stabilized at ~41 units/week, with recent weeks showing a consistent range of 27-52 units. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime stabilization post-Spring peak. The demand for the period P10-P19 has averaged approximately 39.9 units/week (total 399/10), with the last 5 weeks (P15-P19) averaging 39.2 units/week. This indicates a consistent mid-summer baseline for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse. Lead time is highly reliable at exactly 4 periods, which is confirmed by every order arrival from P5 through P19 (excepting P8/P9 which were gaps in ordering). The inventory position is currently 18 on-hand plus 171 in-transit, totaling 189 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the review period (1), we are covering 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~40 units, the intended base stock would be around 230-240 units to maintain a high service level given the profit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio (critical ratio q = 0.8). However, the OR backend's capping logic will regulate the order size to prevent excessive stock-building. I am selecting recent_N where N=10 to capture the stable regime starting from mid-April (P10) through late June (P19), which provides a robust mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) for the current market state.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Analysis of the post-spring period (P10-P20) shows demand has entered a stable but slightly lower regime compared to the March/April peak. The average demand over the last 11 periods is 38.3 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 33.2 units. The dip in P20 (22 units) suggests a potential mid-summer cooling or normal fluctuation. On-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory is 140 units, totaling 192 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 (covering the stable post-peak period) to capture the current mean of ~38 units per week, which ensures 5 weeks of coverage (L+1) totaling ~190 units. This aligns with our current total inventory, allowing for a small maintenance order if the OR backend detects slight under-coverage relative to the service level target (critical ratio ~0.80).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand (Period 16-20) shows a slight reduction compared to early summer, averaging ~33 units/week vs ~42 units/week in P10-P15.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. This SKU is a V-neck blouse, which typically experiences peak demand during Spring and early Summer. Historical data shows a clear shift in demand: early periods (P1-P3) averaged ~17 units, followed by a Spring peak (P4-P9) averaging ~53 units, and a subsequent stabilization in early summer (P10-P15) averaging ~42 units. Recent mid-summer demand (P16-P21) has further softened to an average of ~31.8 units (22, 25, 30, 43, 27, 44 range). The backend 'cap' and base stock logic will be most effective if we focus on this most recent regime to avoid overstocking as the season winds down. I am using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent cooling trend (P16-P21). Lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed in all 'conclude' messages from P5 to P21), so the default lead time parameter is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (starting P16) confirmed: average weekly demand has decreased to ~32 units, down from the early summer average of ~42 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The 'Lennox' V-neck blouse is currently in its mid-summer demand phase. Since Period 16 (mid-May/June), demand has consistently stabilized around a lower mean compared to the Spring peak. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is 28.8 units/week (22, 25, 33, 30, 43, 27, 44), which is significantly lower than the early summer average (~42). I will use a window of the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this established mid-summer regime. Inventory levels are healthy (66 on-hand, 85 in-transit), and lead time remains extremely reliable at exactly 4 periods. The OR backend with mu_hat and sigma_hat based on N=7 will naturally adjust the 'base stock' to reflect this lower mid-summer demand velocity, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a high-spring regime to a more stable mid-summer level. Since Period 16 (June 24), demand has averaged approximately 29.5 units/week (observations: 22, 25, 33, 42). This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' of a mid-summer cooling phase. I am setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 (covering P16-P23) to capture this specific post-peak mid-summer regime (roughly 2 months of data). This balances the need for recent accuracy against volatility. On-hand is 67 and in-transit is 68, which is healthy relative to the current demand levels of ~30-40 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P16-P23) shows further stabilization at a lower average of ~30 units/week compared to the early summer average (~41 units/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, representing the mid-to-late summer period for this V-neck blouse. As identified in the Carry-over Insights, a clear demand regime shift occurred around Period 16 (mid-June), where demand cooled from earlier spring/summer peaks (avg ~42) to a more stable mid-summer average. Evaluating the demand from Period 16 to Period 24 (9 samples), the average weekly demand is approximately 32.1 units with a standard deviation of about 8.5 units. Recent weeks (P20-P24) show even further stabilization (22, 25, 33, 42, 24). Lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P20-P24). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 68 units on hand and 91 in transit. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures this mid-summer stabilization while smoothing out the slight spike in P23. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=9 ensures the volatility estimate matches this specific regime, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level for the lower-volume summer period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand for this v-neck blouse shows a stabilization in the 'mid-summer' regime, which started around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the average weekly demand is approximately 31.4 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~30 units/week. Recent volatility is moderate. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on all recent 'conclude' messages (P20-P25 arrivals). Therefore, setting L to recent_N (N=5) captures this stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to cover the entire mid-summer regime (P16-P25), which provides a stable baseline of ~31 units/week to avoid over-ordering as we exit the peak summer season. Pipeline inventory (93) and on-hand (44) are sufficient to cover the 5-period horizon (L+1) at this demand level, but the OR engine will determine the precise order to maintain base stock given the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand 0) because the order from P22 did not arrive in P26 as expected (ordered 0 units). However, the P22 order was 0 units, and the subsequent expected arrival in P27 (from P23) should be 26 units. Demand in P26 spiked to 61 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~30 units observed since P16. This could signal a back-to-school spike or a late summer sale effect. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the recent spike in demand (P25: 41, P26: 61) relative to the P16-P24 average (~30), I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward movement while acknowledging the return of higher volatility. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in P25-P26 (avg 51 units) breaking the mid-summer stability of ~30 units; monitoring for sustained late-summer/back-to-school regime shift.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 is currently experiencing a massive demand surge. Observation for Period 27 (Date: 2019/8/12) shows demand peaked at 118 units, following a high of 61 units in Period 26. This aligns with late August 'Back-to-School' or transition-to-fall shopping for women's blouses. The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods. The recent 3-period demand average (P25-P27) is approximately 73.3 units, compared to the previous 'mid-summer' average of ~30. To react to this regime shift while acknowledging the high variance (std of last 3 periods is ~39), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the upside potential. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P23 arrival in P27).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed for late August (Periods 26-27): Demand jumped from ~30 units/week to an average of ~90 units/week (+200%), likely driven by Fall/Back-to-School seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant shift starting around Period 26 (late August), coinciding with fall and back-to-school seasonality. Demand in Period 26 and 27 spiked to 61 and 118 units respectively. While Period 28 saw a dip to 39 units, the overall average for the last 3 periods is ~73 units, far exceeding the previous mid-summer baseline of ~30. This volatility is expected as seasonal items transition. Given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, the optimal service level is 80%, but the OR backend's capped policy will look for stable statistics. I am setting L to 'default' as lead times have remained stable at 4. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new higher-demand regime (Periods 26, 27, 28) which averages ~72.7 units/week. This will result in mu_hat = (1+4)*72.7 = 363.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the high volatility (std dev) observed during this transition, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent 118-unit peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 is experiencing a significant demand surge associated with late August/early September seasonality (Back-to-School/Fall). The last four demands are 61, 118, 39, and 61, averaging 69.75 units. This is a clear regime shift from the mid-summer average of ~30. In Period 29, we are out of stock (ending on-hand 0). Total in-transit is 398 units, with expected arrivals in upcoming periods from orders placed in P26 (45 units), P27 (73 units), P28 (140 units), and P29 (140 units). Given the high demand and the stockout, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~70 units/week mean. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-School surge confirmed (P26-P29): Demand shifted from ~30 units/week to ~70 units/week (+133%). High volatility noted (\u03c3 \u2248 33 during this window).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (v-neck blouse) is currently experiencing a Fall/Back-to-School demand surge. Since Period 26, demand has significantly increased, averaging ~71 units/week (P26-P30: 61, 118, 39, 61, 67), compared to the mid-summer average of ~30. The current date (Sept 9) suggests we are in the peak of late-summer/early-fall demand for this category. Although Period 28's demand was lower (39), the overall trend remains elevated and highly volatile (\u03c3 \u2248 29 over the last 5 weeks). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new elevated regime while maintaining a high safety stock via sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility and frequent stockouts (ending on-hand has been 0 in 4 of the last 5 periods). This will help the the OR backend's base-stock calculation reach a sufficient level to meet demand requirements over the lead time plus review period (L+1=5) despite the current zero on-hand balance.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand regime characterized as 'Fall/Back-to-School', which began around Period 26 (August). Demand samples starting from P26 are: 61, 118, 39, 61, 67, 80. The average demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 71 units/week, which is a significant increase from the summer average of ~30. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there are 329 units in-transit, including a large order of 140 units from P28 expected to arrive next period (P32 resolve), and another 140 from P29 expected the following week. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current 71 unit/week regime (Total mu_hat = (1+4)*71 = 355). High volatility (std ~26) during this peak suggests using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure a high service level during this stock-out prone period.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-School demand regime (P26-P31) maintains a high average of ~71 units/week with significant volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 26), necessitating higher base stock levels to avoid frequent stock-outs observed in recent weeks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (V-neck blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Back-to-School regime. Since Period 26 (early August), demand has surged significantly from a base of ~30 units to an average of ~71 units/week (P26-P31). Recent demand in Period 32 was 60 units. While the massive spike in orders between P28-P29 (140 units each) has started arriving (140 units arrived in P32), we still have a sizable in-transit pipeline of 266 units. Given the seasonality, demand is expected to remain elevated but potentially stabilize or slightly taper as we move deeper into autumn. Calculation of mu_hat will use recent_N=7 to capture the demand shift starting at P26, including the current Period 32. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge (\u03c3 \u2248 26). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, so 'calculate' is used to maintain the 4-period baseline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (V-neck blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Back-to-School regime. Demand in Period 33 spiked significantly to 135 units, which is the highest observed demand in the history of the SKU. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), the average demand is approximately 75 units/week with a standard deviation of about 33. The lead time has remained stable at exactly 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the recent massive spike, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher mean and variance while buffering against stockouts, as recent weeks have shown frequent periods of zero ending inventory. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) and reflects the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late-September: Period 33 reached a record high of 135 units; the P26-P33 average has settled at ~75 units/week with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a high-demand Fall/Back-to-School regime that began around P26. Since P26, the average weekly demand has been approximately 74.6 units (61, 118, 39, 61, 67, 80, 60, 135, 70). However, volatility is extremely high (\u03c3 \u2248 33), and demand recently peaked at 135 units in P33 and 70 in P34. Looking at the seasonal context for women's blouses, demand often remains elevated throughout October before tapering or shifting for winter. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to set L to the default (4) and mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P26-P34) to capture this higher mean regime. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 35 per week (scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to provide a sufficient buffer against the high variance observed in this regime, as recent stock-outs indicate the need for a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-School demand regime (P26-P34) confirmed: mean demand increased to ~75 units/week with high volatility (standard deviation ~33).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 739953002 (Womens V-neck blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Back-to-School regime that began around Period 26 (August). Analysis of the last 10 periods (P26-P35) shows mean weekly demand has increased significantly to approximately 73.0 units, with a standard deviation of 29.5, reflecting high volatility. Recent demand (P33-P35) remains strong (135, 70, 57). The actual lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by sequential arrivals from orders placed in P27, P28, P29, P30, and P31. Current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) despite high in-transit stock (386 units), as we are working through a series of smaller orders placed during the start of the surge (P30-P31). To maintain high service levels during this volatile period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=10 to capture the current regime's high mean and variance while filtering out the lower summer baseline. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it remains stable and reliable at 4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (Womens V-neck blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Back-to-School regime that started around Period 26 (late August). Recent demand (P33-P36) shows counts of 135, 70, 57, and 50. While the peak has passed, the average over the last 11 periods (P26-P36) remains elevated at approximately 72 units per week with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 29). On-hand inventory is 34 units, and there is a large pipeline of 346 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all recent observations. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this Fall regime's mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains sufficient stock to cover the roughly 360 units of expected demand across the lead time plus review period (1+L=5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'V-neck blouse' is cooling as we exit the peak Fall/Back-to-School season (P26-P34 avg ~75) and enter late October. Recent demand in P35-P37 (57, 50, 33) shows a clear downward trend. Setting N=4 for mu_hat (P34-P37) captures this deceleration (avg 52.5) while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat N=8) still present in the post-peak environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high pipeline inventory (336 units vs. current on-hand 49), the OR backend will calculate the necessary replenishment to maintain safety stock for the next 5 periods (L+1) without over-ordering as seasonality wanes.

Carry-over insight: Post-Fall peak cooling observed starting P35: demand has decreased for three consecutive periods (57, 50, 33), suggesting a transition away from the late-summer/fall regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 739953002 is showing a cooling trend following the Fall/Back-to-School peak that occurred between P26 and P34 (avg ~75 units). Since P35, demand has settled into a lower range (57, 50, 33, 83), averaging approximately 56 units/week over the last 4 periods. While P38 saw a rebound to 83 units, the overall trajectory for this blouse in November suggests a transition away from peak seasonality. Currently, On-hand inventory is 98 and In-transit is 204 (total 302). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1, the target service level remains high (80%), but the pipeline is currently well-stocked. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak mean (~61 units/week) while providing enough safety stock to handle volatility like the P38 spike. This will stabilize the base stock level and prevent over-ordering as we move further into the late fall season.

Carry-over insight: Post-Fall peak cooling confirmed: Demand regime shifted from ~75 units/week (P26-P34) to ~56 units/week (P35-P38) as the primary Fall season concludes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted away from the Fall/Back-to-School peak (P26-P34 avg ~75) to a lower, post-peak baseline. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has been 57, 50, 33, 83, and 54, averaging 55.4 units per week. While Period 38 saw a spike to 83, the overall trend supports the recent carry-over insight that demand has cooled. On-hand inventory is currently high (173 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. With 102 units in transit (expected arrivals from P36-P39 orders), the pipeline is sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this new lower-demand regime while maintaining recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the ongoing volatility (std dev of ~18 in recent weeks). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear cooling trend following the Fall/Back-to-School peak that occurred between Periods 26 and 34 (avg ~75 units). Since Period 35, demand has settled into a lower regime, with the most recent 6 weeks (P35-P40) averaging 53.1 units (57, 50, 33, 83, 54, 42). While Period 38 saw a spike to 83, the overall trend is toward stabilization. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this 'post-Fall' cooling while acknowledging the volatility observed during this transition. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 168 units on-hand and 101 in-transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy, but we need to sustain orders to match the current ~53 unit/week consumption rate to prevent future stock-outs if demand stabilizes here or if holiday shopping begins to influence sales in late November/December.

Carry-over insight: Post-Fall demand regime (starting P35) averages ~53 units/week, significantly lower than the P26-P34 peak avg of ~75. Demand remains volatile (Range: 33-83).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019) confirms the 'Post-Fall' cooling regime identified in Period 39. Demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) has been 57, 50, 33, 83, 54, 42, 31, resulting in a mean of ~50 units/week. This is a significant drop from the P26-P34 peak of ~75 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (175 units) and 92 units in-transit, we are currently overstocked for this new demand level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (P35-P41). This allows the OR engine to reduce ordering and draw down on-hand inventory, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the moderate volatility (standard deviation ~17.5 in this window).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), we observed a massive demand spike of 315 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the date. This resulted in a total stock-out. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 109 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods and has been locally consistent. Given the timing (early December), demand is expected to remain high due to holiday shopping (Womens Everyday Collection blouse), but likely lower than the extreme Black Friday peak. I am switching to recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased holiday volume while smoothing the extreme 315-unit outlier, and using explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock to recover from the stock-out and cover the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand surge confirmed in Period 42: Demand reached a record 315 units, significantly exceeding the previous Fall regime average of ~53 units. Holiday seasonality is now the dominant driver.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday season for SKU 739953002 (V-neck blouse). Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw a massive demand of 315 units, followed by 144 units in Period 43 (Cyber Monday/Early Dec). The upcoming Period 44 (Dec 9) and Period 45 (Dec 16) are expected to sustain high gift-giving demand before a sharp drop after Christmas. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 322 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Orders placed in P40, P41, P42, and P43 are still in transit (36, 29, 17, and 240 units respectively). The arriving shipment in P44 (ordered P40) is only 36 units, which is unlikely to meet immediate demand. To capture remaining holiday volume and ensure the OR backend sets a high base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent holiday average (~150 units/week) to maintain high service levels, and a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed since P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: P42-P43 average demand is ~230 units/week, up from the post-fall average of ~53 units. Significant stock-outs occurred due to the transition from Fall to Holiday volumes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday season (Period 45 / mid-December). A major demand spike occurred in P42 (315 units) and P43 (144 units). Although P44 showed only 29 units, this is likely due to the stock-out status (starting on-hand was 36, demand was 29, but significant unmet demand often exists in stock-out scenarios or delivery timing artifacts). Historically, December demand for women's blouses remains elevated until Christmas. With an on-hand inventory of only 7 units and a total in-transit pipeline of 620 units (ordered mainly in P43 and P44), we need to maintain high base stock levels. The OR backend uses profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1) to set a service level around 80%. Given the extreme volatility and regime shift, I will use an explicit forecast of 200 units/week for mu_hat (average of recent high-demand weeks P42-P43) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday season (late December). Period 42 (Black Friday) saw 315 units, followed by 144 and 196 units in Periods 43 and 45 respectively. Period 44 was an anomaly at 29, likely due to a localized data reporting dip or mid-December lull before the final pre-Christmas surge. On-hand inventory is 0, but a large pipeline is incoming (975 units in-transit). The Holiday regime average (P42-P45) is approximately 171 units/week. Given we are at the end of December, demand might cool slightly post-Christmas (Period 46/47), but we must maintain high availability for the remaining peak dates. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this high-volume holiday regime (approx 171 per week * 5 weeks = 855). I will use a high volatility estimate (sigma_hat) because of the extreme variance seen recently (\u03c3 \u2248 120 in the holiday window).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P42) confirmed with average weekly demand of ~171 units, though highly volatile (range 29-315). High stock-out risk persists despite large pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30, representing the end of the holiday peak and the transition into early January. In the game history, we have seen massive volatility during the holiday season (P42: 315, P43: 144, P44: 29, P45: 196, P46: 71). The mean demand over this 5-period holiday window (P42-P46) is approximately 151 units per week. However, looking back at early 2019 (P1-P3), demand was significantly lower (avg ~17) before the spring shift. We are now heading into a typically slower retail period (January). We have a very large pipeline of 1064 units, primarily from massive orders placed in P43-P45 to handle the holiday surge. With on-hand currently at 0 and significant stock-outs in recent weeks, we need to maintain a robust base stock while preparing for the post-holiday cooling. I will set mu_hat based on the holiday mean (N=5) to ensure the current pipeline and any new orders cover the 5-period window (L+1), but I expect the backend to cap the order given the large in-transit volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P46) average of ~151 units/week identified with extreme volatility (sigma ~115) and frequent stock-outs; anticipating transition to post-holiday cooling in January.
