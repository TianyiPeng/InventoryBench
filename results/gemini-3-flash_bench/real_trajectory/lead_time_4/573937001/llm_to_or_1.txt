Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 573937001 (Women's Skinny High Waist Jeans). The current date is February 11, 2019. Initial inventory is 0. Promised lead time is 4. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 64, 46, 43, 52, 63. The mean demand is approximately 53.6 units/week with a standard deviation of 9.53. February demand for denim is typically stable without significant seasonal spikes until spring. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1.0 (Critical Ratio = 0.5), the OR backend will target a safety stock level that balances stockouts and holding costs equally. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'default' for L (promised lead time 4) until we observe actual lead times.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a pair of H&M+ skinny jeans (trousers). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) was [64, 46, 43, 52, 63], averaging 53.6 units per week. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 45 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order of 70 units is still in transit (promised lead time L=4). Since the product is a staple item (jeans), demand is relatively stable but we are currently stock-outed. We need to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 periods (5 periods). Using the mean of all 6 available samples (including P1), the average weekly demand is 52.17. For 5 periods, mu_hat should be approximately 260.8. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for a base stock near the median (mu_hat). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all recent data including Period 1, and 'default' for L and sigma.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeans). Historical demand samples show a mean of 53.6 units (64, 46, 43, 52, 63). In Period 1 and 2, observed demand was 45 and 60 respectively, consistent with the historical mean. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 138 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in P1 with L=4 should arrive in P5. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to capture the most relevant recent levels (including historical samples) and set L to 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 4 is incorrect.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is H&M+ skinny high-waist jeans. Historical demand samples (64, 46, 43, 52, 63) show a mean of 53.6. Since starting the game, demand has been 45, 60, and 66, showing a slight upward trend or stabilization around 60. On-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (Period 1) is not expected to arrive until Period 5's arrival phase (visible in Period 6). Currently, we have 206 units in transit (70+68+68), which covers roughly 3.4 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (avg ~57), and for sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is H&M+ skinny jeans, a staple item. Demand samples (64, 46, 43, 52, 63, plus concluding periods 45, 60, 66, 74) show a clear upward trend in the last four weeks (avg ~61). Promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders from Periods 1-4 are in-transit (Total: 281). Since L=4, the P1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning all demand in P1-P4 was lost. To stabilize, I will use recent demand history (N=5: Periods 1-4 + last pre-game sample) which averages ~61.4 units/period to set mu_hat. This covers the lead time plus the review period (1+L=5). I will keep L at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'ED Madison Skinny HW' jeans. Historical demand samples (64, 46, 43, 52, 63) and recent game history demand (45, 60, 66, 74, 63) show a relatively stable mean around 57-60 units per period. Period 1's order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=4) in Period 5, confirming the lead time for now. On-hand inventory is low (7 units) due to the first 4 periods having zero sales (stockouts waiting for first delivery), but a large pipeline (238 units) is in transit. Since L=4, my parameters cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand \u03bc \u2248 60, so mu_hat should be around 5 * 60 = 300. Demand appears to be slightly trending upward compared to the pre-game samples, so I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the game history levels safely.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand in game periods [P1-P5] shows a slight increase (avg ~61.6) compared to pre-game samples (avg ~53.6).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a pair of skinny high-waist jeans. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 30, with a pipeline of 233 units (ordered in P3, P4, P5, P6). Pre-game demand mean was 53.6, while game demand (P1-P6) has averaged 58.8. The most recent demand (P6) dropped to 45, but the overall trend in the game periods remains higher than the initial samples. Due to the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. To ensure we don't over-order while covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) over the 6 available game periods to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term history. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed 4 periods matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is skinny high-waist jeans. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand in the game periods (P1-P7) has averaged 62.3 units, compared to the pre-game average of 53.6, suggesting a sustained increase as we move into spring. The recent demand shows higher volatility (Std Dev ~13.5). We currently have 15 units on hand and 197 in transit. Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the higher mean and variance observed during the active game periods, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the current demand regime and the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods P1-P7 average 62.3 units (approx +16% vs pre-game). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waist skinny jeans. Historically, demand has averaged 62.3 units in the game periods (P1-P7), but Period 8 saw a spike to 96 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, and P8 concludes). Currently, there are 208 units in-transit (orders from P5: 27, P6: 63, P7: 32, P8: 86). The order from P5 (27 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 9. Given the recent stockout and the high demand in Period 8, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time. Specifically, I am using N=8 for mu_hat (covering the entire game history to capture the higher game-period average of 66.5 units) to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=8) to account for the increased volatility observed in game periods (range 45-96).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand remains elevated; game-period average (P1-P8) is 66.5 units compared to pre-game average of 53.6. Demand peaked at 96 in P8, causing an inventory stockout.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a staple (5-pocket skinny jeans), but we have faced two consecutive periods of stockouts. In P8, demand spiked to 96, exhausting on-hand stock. In P9, demand was 40, but we only had 27 units (from the Period 5 order), resulting in another stockout. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 order arrived in P9). Since P5 was a very small order (27 units), and we have a large pipeline of 277 units (from orders in P6, P7, P8, and P9), we are waiting for larger shipments to arrive starting next period. The game-period demand (P1-P9) averages 63.5 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average (~53.6). To recover from the stockouts and handle the volatility (std dev in game is ~18), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (all game periods) to reflect this higher demand regime and ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a skinny high-waisted denim jean, a core retail item that typically experiences steady demand with slight boosts in spring/summer. Historical demand in the game periods (P1-P10) averages 61.5 units, which is higher than the pre-game average of 53.6. Demand showed a significant peak in Period 8 (96 units) followed by a dip in Periods 9 and 10 (~41.5 units). I am currently carrying 20 units on-hand with 255 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1 through 6. Given the recent variability (a sharp peak followed by a dip), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 game periods (N=5) to capture the recent higher-than-historical mean while dampening the impact of the Period 8 spike. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to reflect the current volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (skinny jeans) is in a post-peak spring demand phase. Historical demand in-game (Periods 1-11) has averaged ~60 units, significantly higher than the pre-game samples (~53.6). We observed a demand spike in P4-P8 (avg ~72) followed by a cooling period in P9-P11 (avg ~42). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (8 units), but pipeline inventory (255 units) is substantial due to large orders placed in P8 and P9 (86 and 96 units respectively) that are expected to arrive in P12 and P13. Given the recent lower demand (avg 42 over the last 3 periods), I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) to capture the higher in-game mean while acknowledging the recent slowdown, setting mu_hat for the 5-period horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: recent periods (P9-P11) saw a decline to avg 42 units compared to the surge avg of 72 in P4-P8. Supply chain is stable with 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are observing the demand for 'ED Madison Skinny HW' jeans. Historically, demand showed a surge in March/April (Avg ~72 in P4-P8) but has since cooled down to a lower regime (Avg ~41.5 in P9-P12). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all past deliveries (P5 through P12). Current on-hand inventory is 55, and there is a significant pipeline of 206 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given the 4-period lead time, we must forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (Avg 41.5) while moving away from the high-demand volatility of early April. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the current localized demand average. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level following the April peak: Period 9-12 average demand is 41.5 units, compared to the Period 4-8 peak average of 72 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 starts following a confirmed demand stabilization period. Demand has settled significantly from the April peak (avg ~72) to a new, lower baseline (avg ~41.8 over the last 5 periods: P9-P13). The latest demand was 43. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 108, In-transit: 110) because the heavy orders placed during the April surge are now arriving (P8 and P9 orders arrived in P12 and P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which naturally leans towards a tight inventory. Given the overstock (218 units total for an expected 5-period demand of ~210 units) and the downward shift in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the lower regime, and L to recent_N (N=4) to confirm the 4-period lead time. The OR engine's base-stock calculation will likely result in zero or minimal ordering due to the high pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (skinny jeans) shows a stabilized demand regime following an April peak. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the average demand is 46 units, though P14 saw a slight uptick to 67. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 82 units, with 69 units remaining in the pipeline (specifically orders from P11 and P12 totaling 69, which are expected in P15 and P16). Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning we should aim for the median demand to minimize total costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current post-peak demand level (~46 units), and N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility (standard deviation ~11.5). These parameters will likely result in a low or zero order this period as existing inventory plus pipeline are sufficient to cover the 5-period horizon (L+1) at this demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand (P9-P14) has stabilized at a lower average of 46 units compared to the P4-P8 peak of 72. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny jeans, which experienced a demand peak in March/April (avg ~72) and transitioned into a lower stable regime (avg ~46) throughout May until Period 15. However, Period 15 saw a significant demand spike to 109 units, which may indicate a new seasonal or promotional shift. Recent lead times are consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (5 units), with a total pipeline of 101 units (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15 expected in P16, P17, P18, P19). Given the recent demand spike and the risk of stockout, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering P9-P15) to capture the stabilization period and the recent spike, which results in a balanced but responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Potential demand shift detected in Period 15 (109 units), deviating from the May avg ~46. Monitoring for a new sustained regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant demand shift. Following a stable low-demand period (avg ~46), the last two periods have seen a sharp increase in demand: P15 (109 units) and P16 (81 units), resulting in a stockout at the start of P17. This surge aligns with the start of June, suggesting a possible summer seasonality shift for 'skinny superstretch jeans'. The average demand for P15-P16 is 95 units. To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs (Profit $1/Holding $1 ratio implies a 50% service level target), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory includes orders from P13 (0), P14 (0), P15 (64), and P16 (98), totaling 162 units, with arrivals expected to resume in Period 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 15: Average demand increased significantly to 95 units (P15-16) from the previous May average of 46 units (+106%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573937001' (Skinny Jeans) is currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory due to a significant demand shift. Demand in Period 15 was 109 and Period 16 was 81, followed by a lower 49 in Period 17, but the average for P15-P17 is 79.7, which is much higher than the previous baseline of ~46. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. The arrivals for the orders placed in Periods 13 and 14 (totaling 0 units) followed by the lead time gap have left the system vulnerable until the Period 15 order (64 units) arrives in Period 19. To recover service levels and account for the new regime, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~80 per period over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility from 109 down to 49. In-transit pipeline (290) is currently high due to recent aggressive ordering (64+98+128). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observed lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are currently experiencing a stockout situation where on-hand inventory is 0 despite a pipeline of 399 units. This is due to orders placed in Periods 13 and 14 being 0 (based on high stock at the time), followed by a massive demand surge starting in Period 15. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods; therefore, the order from Period 15 (64 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of the current Period 19. My decision for Period 19 will be made before this arrival is visible. Demand history shows a highly volatile 'June' transition: P15 (109), P16 (81), P17 (49), P18 (35). The average of these 4 periods is 68.5. Given the previous regime shift confirmed in Period 17 (averaging 95 units), but observing a tapering down in the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this high-volatility window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the high standard deviation observed during this shift (approx 33 units). This approach balances the need to recover from the stockout against the risk of over-ordering if demand continues to drop toward May levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in June (P15-P18): after a surge to 109 and 81, demand dropped to 49 and 35. Average demand for this 4-period window is 68.5 units, significantly higher than the May average of 46 units but showing a downward trend.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/06/24), we are observing high demand volatility in June for SKU 573937001 (jeans). Demand has fluctuated significantly: 109, 81, 49, 35, and 55 units over the last five periods (P15-P19), averaging 65.8 units. The supply chain has stabilized after zero arrivals in P17 and P18; the P15 order arrived exactly on the 4-period promised lead time in P19. However, orders from P13 and P14 (placed during high inventory levels) were essentially zero or skipped, creating a gap in the pipeline that is currently causing low on-hand inventory (9 units). There are 335 units in transit, primarily from large orders placed in P16-P18 to recover from stockouts. To manage the current high volatility while accounting for the recent downward trend in the last few weeks (49, 35, 55), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current June regime (avg ~66). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently returned to the promised 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Historical demand shows significant volatility following a mid-May surge (P15-P16: 109, 81), which was followed by a sharp decline in June (P19-P20: 55, 17). The current on-hand inventory is 90 units, with 237 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand average for the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is 57.6 units, but the most recent two weeks show a substantial tapering (average 36). Given the SKU is 'skinny jeans' and we are entering July, we expect a seasonal cooling or a return to the long-term baseline. I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent volatility while smoothing the extreme P20 low, and 10 periods for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed throughout the second quarter. The heavy pipeline (237 units) relative to current demand signals that the OR engine will likely order 0 units to avoid high holding costs, which is appropriate given the 1.0/1.0 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility observed in June: demand dropped from a May/early June average of 68.5 units to 36 units over the last two periods (P19-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), demand has significantly cooled from the June peak. Over the last three periods (P19-P21), demand has been 55, 17, and 33 units respectively, averaging 35 units. This is a sharp decline compared to the volatile P15-P18 period which averaged 68.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is high at 185 units, with 109 units still in-transit from Period 18 (expected to arrive this period, P22). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock level (294 total units vs. a recent demand average of 35), the inventory position is more than sufficient to cover the next (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend suppresses further ordering while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower level in late June/early July: Average demand for P19-P21 is ~35 units, down from the June average of 68.5 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Inventory is high (242 units on-hand) following the arrival of large orders placed during the mid-June demand spike. Demand has since cooled down significantly; the last four periods (P19-P22) show an average demand of 39.25 units (55, 17, 33, 52), which is a stabilization at a lower level compared to the June peak but higher than the pre-game baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory already covering over 6 periods of demand at the current rate (242 / 39.25 \u2248 6.16), the goal is to prevent further stock accumulation while maintaining a safety buffer. I will set the demand mean using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this new lower-demand regime and maintain the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July (P19-P22) at an average of 39.25 units, significantly lower than the June peak (~68.5).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 24 (late July). The demand regime for July (Periods 19-23) has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 39.2 units compared to the volatile June period. The large orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 have fully arrived, resulting in a high on-hand inventory of 203 units. With no units in transit and a consistent lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covering the demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) from current stock alone (203 / 5 = 40.6 units/period). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the inventory levels already exceeding the expected sum of demand over the replenishment lead time, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime (N=5 for P19-P23) to avoid triggering unnecessary orders while we burn through existing stock. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July (P19-23) at an average of 39.2 units, significantly lower than the June surge. Inventory is currently high due to late June ordering for a peak that has since subsided.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level in July compared to the June peak. Specifically, demand over the last five periods (P20-P24) has been 17, 33, 52, 39, and 22, averaging approximately 32.6 units. This is a clear decline from the average of 68.5 units seen in June. On-hand inventory is currently very high (181 units) because large orders placed during the June surge (P16-P18) arrived just as demand cooled. With a 4-period lead time, we must look at the (L+1) window. Current inventory (181 on-hand + 0 in-transit = 181 units) covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand (5 * 32.6 = 163). To minimize holding costs while demand remains low, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods to capture this lower July regime and leave L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July (P20-P24) at an average of 32.6 units, reflecting a post-summer-peak decline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for the product (trousers/5-pocket jeans) has consistently declined since the June peak, entering a low-demand late-summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 33 units (33, 52, 39, 22, 19). The current on-hand inventory of 162 units is very high relative to this demand level, equivalent to nearly 5 periods of stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (L=4). To minimize holding costs while demand is low, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (P21-P25) which reflects this downshift. The OR backend will likely order 0 units given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory compared to the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July/early August (P21-P25) at an average of 33 units, reflecting a post-summer-peak decline. Previous June/July average was significantly higher (~68).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Demand for this SKU (skinny jeans) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since the June surge. Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 35.2 units, a consistent trend compared to the previous peak. On-hand inventory is currently very high (118 units) due to aggressive ordering during the June demand spike, covering over three weeks of current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P18 order arrived P22). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean (approx 35.2) and volatility. This will prevent the OR backend from placing large orders while we burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July/early August: P22-P26 average demand is 35.2 units, down significantly from the June peak (~68.5).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for this 'skinny superstretch jeans' product has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following a June peak. Specifically, demand in the last block (P19-P27) has averaged 35.9 units, though the most recent period (P27) saw an uptick to 62. The Lead Time is confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple successful arrivals (e.g., P18 order arrived in P22). On-hand inventory is 56 units, with 58 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27). Total pipeline inventory is 114 units. Given the transition into late August/early September, I expect demand to remain moderate but potentially increase toward 'Back to School' timing. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak average demand while weighting recent observations. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period timing is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July/August: P20-P27 average demand is 34.6 units, but P27 shows a potential shift upward (62 units) as we enter the transition from summer to fall. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand has shifted upward significantly in the last two periods (62 in P27, 61 in P28), confirming the transition from the low-demand July period (avg ~33) to a higher late-summer/early-fall regime. On-hand inventory is currently depleted (0) due to this spike. In-transit inventory includes orders from P25 (1), P26 (2), P27 (55), and P28 (63), totaling 121 units. With a stable 4-period lead time, we expect the P25 order in P29, P26 in P30, P27 in P31, and P28 in P32. To address the current stockout and the new demand level (avg ~61.5 in the last 2 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples (N=2) to quickly adapt to this higher demand level, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods and using a wider sigma window (N=5) to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late August: P27-P28 average demand increased to 61.5 units from the previous July/early-August average of ~34 (+80%). This indicates a seasonal transition to higher fall volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (September 2), we are seeing a seasonal demand shift. While July/early August demand averaged around 34 units, the last three periods (P27-P29) show an increase (62, 61, 39), averaging 54 units. The drop to 39 in P29 followed two weeks of ~60, but historically, September/Fall seasonal transitions for jeans (the 'ED Madison Skinny HW') trend upward. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the shipment from P25 (1 unit) was insufficient. The pipeline inventory (216 units) contains orders from P26 (2), P27 (55), P28 (63), and P29 (96). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, because current on-hand is 0 and recent demand suggests a new higher regime (~55-60), I will use recent_N=3 to capture the fall uptick and ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) window. This should trigger an order that maintains availability as we move deeper into the fall denim season.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand regime shifted from ~34 units (July/August) to an average of 54 units (P27-P29), signaling the start of the fall peak for denim.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a confirmed fall demand regime for superstretch denim. The demand average for the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 62, 61, 39, 56) is approximately 54.5 units, which is significantly higher than the July/August low-demand period (~34 units). Despite ordering significantly in P27-P30, the 4-period lead time has resulted in on-hand stockouts as recent arrivals (P29: 1 unit, P30: 2 units) were from low-volume orders placed in July. However, a significant pipeline of 268 units is expected to arrive starting next period (P31 arrival = P27 order of 55 units, followed by P28 order of 63, etc.). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this sustained higher demand level (N=4 corresponds to the regime shift identified in Period 30). I will use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility (39 to 62). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September fall demand regime confirmed (P27-P30): average demand 54.5 units, up from 34.6 units in summer (+57%).

On-hand inventory is low (16 units), but the pipeline is substantial (218 units). Specifically, orders from P28 (63 units), P29 (96 units), and P30 (54 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 32, 33, and 34 respectively. To maintain the inventory target for this higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the fall transition) to capture the current mean of ~51.4 units per period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition (standard deviation ~11.5). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods of the 51.4 unit demand average.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P31) confirmed: mean demand increased to 51.4 units from summer average of 34.6 (+48%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall demand regime for this SKU (H&M+ skinny jeans) is now well-established. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged 49.0 units, significantly higher than the summer average of approximately 34.6 (+41%). While demand in the most recent two periods (P31-P32) dipped slightly to 39 and 37 units, the broader trend from late August through September indicates a stabilized fall base. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the P28 order arriving exactly on schedule in P32. Inventory is currently recovering from August stockouts with 42 units on hand and 178 in transit (scheduled arrivals: P33=96, P34=54, P35=5, P36=23). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 captures this fall regime while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations seen in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P32) confirmed: average demand 49.0 units compared to summer average of 34.6 (+41.6%).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall demand regime for denim remains active as we enter late September. Historical demand from P27 to P33 shows a mean of 53.4 units (62, 61, 39, 56, 39, 37, 80), representing a significant increase over the summer average of 34.6 (+54%). Although recent weeks (P29-P32) showed a slight dip, the spike to 80 units in P33 confirms underlying volatility and the potential for high demand in the fall season. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). To ensure adequate stock while managing high holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P27-P33) to capture this fall regime. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 7 periods to account for the increased volatility (range 37 to 80). L remains at the default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P33) average is 53.4 units, maintaining a ~54% increase over the summer baseline. High volatility is present (std dev ~15.9 in this period).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 starts on October 7, 2019. We are currently in a fall demand regime for denim trousers, which began around Period 27 (late August). The demand for the last 8 periods (P27-P34) averages 53.1 units, representing a sustained increase over the summer average (~34 units). Most recent demand was 51 units. Supply chain remains very stable with a consistent 4-period lead time observed for all recent arrivals (P29 through P34). Current on-hand inventory is 61, with 133 units in-transit. To maintain the inventory level for a lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (L+1=5), I will use the recent_N method based on the established fall regime (N=8) to capture the higher mean and volatility. This ensures we have enough stock to meet the ~53 units/week fall demand without over-ordering as we move deeper into October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-October (2019/10/14), currently in the Fall demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 27-35), the average demand is approximately 52.8 units (calculated from 62, 61, 39, 56, 39, 37, 80, 51, 50). This aligns with the 'Fall' insight noted in previous periods. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P25-P31 all arriving exactly at L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 200 units, and on-hand is 16. I will use the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the current Fall demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels reflect recent seasonality. The OR backend will automatically adjust for lead time using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P35) stabilized at an average of 52.8 units. Standard deviation in this regime is approximately 13.9 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 37 (Oct 21) is firmly in the fall demand regime. Analyzing the fall regime (P27-P36), the average demand is 52.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.5. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 225 units in-transit. The most recent order arrival from Period 32 (23 units) arrived as expected in Period 36, confirming a consistent 4-period lead time. I will continue using the Fall regime average (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat, ensuring we account for (L+1) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly based on recent volatility. This provides a base stock target that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50th percentile service level) while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents over-ordering during high-variance periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P36) average is 52.0 units, showing sustained volume compared to the summer baseline (~34 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late autumn/pre-holiday phase. Demand for Period 37 was 50 units, closely following the established fall regime (P27-P37) mean of 51.8. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 233 units in transit. Orders from Period 34 (80 units) are expected to arrive in Period 38 (this period), so they are visible in next period's report. To maintain stability, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P27-P37) which represents the sustained fall demand pattern. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1), ensuring sufficient safety stock for the ~14.6 std dev observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P27-P37) stabilized at an average of 51.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.6. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/4. We are firmly in the 'Fall' demand regime for this SKU (denim trousers). The fall regime (P27 onwards) has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 51.8 units and a standard deviation of 14.6. Recent demand remains strong, with Period 38 showing 67 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. With On-hand inventory at 13 and In-transit at 178, we need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand season. For OR parameters, L remains default (4), mu_hat is calculated using the stable fall regime (last 12 periods, P27-P38), and sigma_hat is also set using this regime to capture the current volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, approaching the holiday season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand for denim (5-pocket jeans) typically peaks in late November. The 'Fall' regime (P27-P39) has shown a stable average of 54.3 units, but the last two periods (P38-P39) show a slight uptick (67, 64), likely signaling the start of holiday demand. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat to capture the fall regime average (approx 54.3) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent higher samples. Sigma_hat is set with recent_N=13 to reflect the moderate volatility (std dev ~14) observed since late August. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 8 periods remaining in the game, maintaining a sufficient pipeline for the holiday peak is critical to avoid stockouts like those seen in P36-P37.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand transition: Demand in late October/early November (P38-P39) has increased to an average of 65.5 units, compared to the early fall average of 52.0, likely signaling seasonal peak for Q4.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), approaching the peak holiday season for denim. Demand has recently transitioned from a fall average of 52.0 units to a higher average of ~62.3 units over the last three periods (P38-P40: 67, 64, 57). The carry-over insight from Period 40 suggests a shift to ~65.5 based on the first two weeks; including P40 brings this to 62.7. Given the upcoming Black Friday/Cyber Monday window in late November, I expect demand to remain at this higher level or increase further. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 12 units on-hand and 200 in-transit, we must ensure parameters support this higher holiday volume. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this holiday shift while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P38-P40): average demand increased to 62.7 units from the early fall average of 52.0 (+20%). Anticipating continued high volume through late November/December.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Historically, denim products (skinny jeans) see a significant peak during this late November period. The holiday demand regime (P38-P41) has shown an average demand of 58.3 units, signaling a transition into Q4 peak and representing a shift from the earlier fall average of ~52. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in P41 and high seasonal demand is expected, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday trend (~58 units/period x 5 periods = 291). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in recent weeks (P38-P41). These parameters aim to replenish inventory quickly to meet the peak holiday volume.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P38-P41): average demand increased to 58.3 units from the early fall average of 52.0 units (+12%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked massively to 305 units (Black Friday week), causing a complete stockout. This follows the anticipated Q4 seasonal surge, though the magnitude (over 5x the recent average) was exceptional. For Period 43 (early December), demand is expected to remain high but likely lower than the extreme Black Friday peak. The pipeline inventory (267 units) includes orders from P39-P42, with 73 units from P39 expected to arrive during the current period (P43). Given the stockout and the high seasonality, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated holiday demand regime (P38-P42 average is 107.6 units), including the spike, while relying on the backend's default lead time of 4 periods which has been consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (305 units). Late Q4 (P38-P42) demand average shifted to 107.6 units from early fall average of 52.0 (+107%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, the week following Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Period 42 saw a massive spike (305 units) and Period 43 remained elevated (157 units). This clearly marks the Q4 holiday peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 465 units (orders from P40-P43: 69, 72, 53, 271). The order from P40 (69 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P44). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. The demand average for the recent holiday regime (P38-P43) has shifted to approximately 113.3 units per period. Given the proximity to the end of the game (P47) and the high volatility of holiday shopping, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to ensure we capture the elevated seasonality of December (which includes post-Cyber Monday and the Christmas buildup) while sigma_hat is set to capture the high variance (std dev ~105 in the last 6 weeks). This approach aims to minimize further stockouts while being mindful that the game ends in 4 periods, meaning orders placed now are the final ones that can arrive.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P38-P43) average demand is 113.3 units, driven by significant spikes in P42 (305) and P43 (157). Standard deviation has increased significantly alongside the mean.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), following the massive Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spikes in P42 (305) and P43 (157). Demand for P44 settled back to 51 units. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), we must ensure enough inventory arrives to cover the end of the holiday season and any potential pre-Christmas surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently very thick (511 units) due to large orders placed in P43 (271) and P44 (115) to replenish after the stockouts. These orders are expected to arrive in P47 and beyond. However, for immediate demand in P45-P46-P47, we rely on the orders placed in P41 (72 units, arriving now in P45 resolution) and P42 (53 units, arriving P46 resolution). Total coverage needed for L+1 (5 periods) involves a mean demand influenced by the recent volatility. I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering P38-P44) to capture the high-mean, high-variance holiday regime (avg ~100/period) while the pipeline catches up. Given the game is ending in 3 periods, the OR backend's inventory balancing will naturally taper, but high sigma is maintained to guard against secondary spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P38-P44) average is 104.4 units, with extreme volatility (std dev ~94) due to the Black Friday spike (305). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the final period (47). The product is superstretch denim jeans, which saw a massive spike during Black Friday (P42: 305 units) and remained high through early December (P43: 157 units). However, demand has since normalized to 51 units in P44 and P45. The holiday peak has passed. With a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P46) would arrive in Period 50 (46 + 4), which is beyond the game's end at Period 47. Therefore, ordering more units now will only incur holding costs without the possibility of making more sales before the game ends. My objective is to satisfy demand for the remaining periods while minimizing ending inventory. On-hand inventory is 39, and demand in the last two periods was 51. While we might stock out in P46/P47, the pipeline (443 units) is already extremely high due to replenishment orders following the Black Friday spike (P43: 271, P44: 115). Ordering now is counter-productive. I will set the parameters to effectively stop new orders by using a lower recent_N demand mean and standard lead time, allowing the OR backend to realize that on-hand + pipeline is already far above any reasonable base stock for the final two weeks of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand normalized post-peak: demand dropped from an average of 113.3 (P38-P43) to 51 units (P44-P45) as the Christmas season concludes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in the post-holiday normalization phase. Demand from the last three periods (P44-P46) has stabilized at 51, 51, and 43 units, respectively (average 48.3), which is a significant drop from the Black Friday peak (P42: 305, P43: 157). The supply chain remains stable with a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P42 order in P46. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, with 390 units in-transit (P43: 271, P44: 115, P45: 4). Since the in-transit pipeline (390 units) significantly exceeds the requirements for the next (L+1=5) periods based on current normalized demand (~48 units/period), the policy should lean towards minimizing new orders (the OR backend will handle this via the base-stock calculation). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the post-holiday demand regime (P44-P46) and ensure the ordering logic reacts to the lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization confirmed: P44-P46 demand average is 48.3 units, down from the P38-P43 holiday surge average of 113 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
