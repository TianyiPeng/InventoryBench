Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The historical demand data provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 38 units/week (46, 33, 53, 37, 21). The last observation (Feb 4) was quite low (21). Given the date is mid-February, we are past most Valentine's Day shopping and heading into a standard late-winter period. There is no historical lead time feedback yet, so I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the provided 5 samples to establish a baseline forecast. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve the optimal service level based on the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 59 units, and had a demand of 26 units. Since on-hand was 0, those 26 units in Period 1 were lost sales (sold=0). The 59 units ordered in Period 1 are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Given the historical demand samples (46, 33, 53, 37, 21) plus the actual demand in Period 1 (26), the mean demand is roughly 36 units/period. The current in-transit (59) is insufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approx 180 units needed). I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (including the recent Period 1 demand) to ensure the OR engine orders enough to reach a healthy base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period. I will use 'default' lead time (4) as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest otherwise yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (late Jan to early Feb) shows 46, 33, 53, 37, 21, with recent periods P1-P2 seeing 26 and 23 units. The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', a standard accessory. There are no major holiday spikes expected in late February/early March. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 115 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect the P1 order to arrive in P5 and the P2 order in P6. We have stockouts for P1 and P2 because we started with 0 inventory and lead time is > 0. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent slight decline in demand (mean approx 26-30) compared to the earlier Jan peaks (~40+). For \u03c3\u0302, recent_N (N=5) will be used to reflect current volatility. L is set to default as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest a lead time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Flirty Linnea necklace) has had demand in the last 3 periods (26, 23, 14), but we have had 0 sales because on-hand inventory is 0. The promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in P1 (59 units), P2 (56 units), and P3 (54 units) are currently in-transit (Total 169). Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order (ordered at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5. We will see this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 169 in-transit. The demand history (including pre-game samples) shows: 46, 33, 53, 37, 21, 26, 23, 14. The recent demand (last 3 periods) averages 21, while the full history averages ~31. Given the downward trend in the last few weeks post-February (post-Valentine's?), I will use a recent_N approach for demand to avoid over-ordering while waiting for the first shipment to arrive. I will set L to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Looking at the demand history provided (including pre-game samples), the weekly demand has been: 46, 33, 53, 37, 21 (samples), and 26, 23, 14, 4 (observed in-game). There is a clear downward trend in demand since February. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 169 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order (59 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (this period), but we will only see confirmation in Period 6. Since on-hand is zero, we've had lost sales for 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent sharp decline (avg ~17.6) and 'default' for lead time as we haven't confirmed any arrival deviations yet. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the decreasing volatility as demand drops.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', a jewelry accessory. Demand history shows a declining trend from initial samples (avg ~38) to recent periods (P1: 26, P2: 23, P3: 14, P4: 4, P5: 12). The mean demand of the last 5 samples is 15.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and P1's order arrived exactly in P5 (L=4 confirmed). Currently, on-hand is 47 and in-transit is 110 (orders from P2 and P3). Total pipeline (157) covers approximately 10 periods of current average demand. However, the initial five samples provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' (prior to P1) were much higher (avg 38). Given the recent drop, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the lower current demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer in case the decline was temporary and demand stabilizes around this level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Analysis of historical demand (Jan-Mar) shows a significant downward trend: Jan avg ~42, Feb avg ~21, March avg to date ~9. This suggests a post-holiday/winter clearance or a cooling off of this specific style. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 93, with 54 units in-transit (ordered P3, expected P7). Total inventory (93+54=147) is very high relative to recent demand (avg ~10 in March). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (March) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while holding costs accumulate. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting March (Period 4): average weekly demand dropped from ~21-40 range in Jan/Feb to ~9 units (-50%+ compared to Feb).

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The historical data shows a significant shift in demand. After an initial high-demand period in Jan/Feb (avg ~38), demand plummeted in early March (Periods 4-6) to around 9 units. However, Period 7 saw a sudden spike to 47 units. Given the product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', this spike could be related to early spring fashion trends or preparation for upcoming spring events. On-hand inventory is currently 100 units. Previous orders from Periods 1-3 arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. There are currently no units in transit. Since on-hand inventory (100) is significantly higher than both the recent low average and the latest peak, we should be cautious about over-ordering. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' based on history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from the low-demand March weeks to the high-demand Period 7, allowing the system to react to the potential return of higher demand while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect this increased uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in March/April: shifted from avg ~9 (Periods 4-6) to 47 (Period 7), suggesting seasonal sensitivity.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has shown significant demand fluctuations. After a low-demand period in March (averaging ~9 units), demand spiked in late March and early April to 47 and 42 units respectively. This suggests a seasonal shift or promotion effect as we move into spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, and 7) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 58 units with 28 units in-transit (ordered in Period 8, expected to arrive around Period 12). Given the recent demand surge (averaging ~44.5 over the last two weeks), I will set mu_hat using the last two high-demand samples (N=2) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this new regime and avoids stockouts. Sigma_hat will also use the last two samples to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: late March/early April demand (Periods 7-8) averaged 44.5 units, a significant increase from the March average of ~9 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15 (Period 10). The product is a decorative necklace. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: Jan/Feb (Period 1-3) averaged ~34, early March (Period 4-6) dropped to ~9, and late March/early April (Period 7-9) increased to ~39. The most recent three periods (P7-P9) show demand of 47, 42, and 28 (avg 39). This suggests the low-demand trough of early March has passed, likely due to spring seasonality. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived exactly at P5, P6, and P7). Currently, we have 30 units on-hand and 79 in-transit (orders from P8 and P9). Given the promised lead time (L=4), we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current active high-demand regime (+39/week) while ignoring the early March slump, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents stockouts during this recovery phase.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history, there was a pronounced slump in early March (Periods 4-6, avg ~9) followed by a strong recovery in late March and April (Periods 7-10, avg 34.5). The most recent demand samples are 47, 42, 28, and 21. While demand is cooling slightly from the early April peak, it remains much higher than the March lows. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this current regime (avg 34.5). For lead time, historical arrivals from Periods 1-3 all confirmed a lead time of 4 periods. The inventory position is tight: on-hand is only 9 units, which is below the current weekly demand, meaning we will likely stock out in Period 11 before the next arrivals. There is a large pipeline (135 units) consisting of orders from Periods 8, 9, and 10. The order from Period 8 (28 units) is expected to arrive in Period 12 (Current Period 11 + 1), based on the L=4 lead time. I will maintain L=4 using the calculate method. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in April: Period 7-10 average is 34.5 units, significantly higher than the March early-month average of 9 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a thin metal chain necklace, which often sees increased demand in late spring and summer. Historical demand shows a distinct regime shift: early March was very low (avg ~9), but demand has significantly increased since late March (Period 7-11), averaging ~31 units. The period 11 demand of 15 was restricted by an out-of-stock situation (on-hand was 9), so actual demand is likely higher. We are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand, but there are 187 units in transit. The first significant reorder (28 units from P8) is expected to arrive this period (P12) based on the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand regime has shifted to a higher level (average ~31 over the last 5 periods), I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this newer, higher demand level while ignoring the very low March figures. Lead time L will remain at the default (promised 4) as arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 were consistent with this timeframe.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 6, 2019 (Period 13). We are managing the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Reviewing lead times from concluded periods 5, 6, 7, and 12, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows a volatile pattern: Jan/Feb (33-53), early March (4-12), and a recovery in April (15-47). Most recently, demand has softened in the last two periods (P11: 15, P12: 9). The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift in April, but the very recent drop suggests we should avoid overreacting to the high April peak. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 7 to 12) to capture the April recovery and May slowdown, resulting in an average demand of approximately 27 units per period. This balances the high April outliers (47, 42) with the lower recent marks (15, 9). Sigma will also use recent_N=6 to reflect this current volatility. With On-hand=19 and In-transit=159, the pipeline is quite full, reflecting orders placed in P9, P10, P11, and P12 that are expected to arrive in P13, P14, P15, and P16 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility continues into May: After an April peak (avg ~27), the most recent two periods (P11-P12) show a significant decline to an average of 12 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', which appears to exhibit seasonal demand fluctuations. After a strong April (avg ~27 units), demand in the last three periods (P11-P13) has softened (15, 9, 28) averaging 17.3 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P8 arrived in P12, P9 arrived in P13). Currently, we have 42 units on-hand and 108 units in-transit (ordered in P10, P11). The in-transit stock from P10 (56 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P14) and will be visible in the next observation. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 80%. I will use the last 7 periods (covering April and early May) to capture the current demand regime, as using the full history would include the atypical March slump and January/February peaks. N=7 covers P7 through P13, representing the most recent stabilized yet volatile behavior (avg ~24 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime in May (P11-P13) has stabilized at a lower average of ~17 units compared to April's ~27 units, though remains higher than the March lows.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 12, 13, and 14). Demand has been highly volatile: April (P8-P11) averaged approx 26.5 units, but May has seen a significant spike with P14 demand hitting 69 units. This suggests a late spring/pre-summer surge for 'Accessories'. We have 29 units on hand and 64 in-transit (P11, P14 orders). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). To account for the recent surge while smoothing for the previous lower May weeks, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (averaging P11-P14 demand: 15, 9, 28, 69 = 30.25) to capture the trend shift, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in mid-May: Period 14 recorded 69 units, the highest in history, following a low of 9 units in Period 12, indicating high seasonal sensitivity for this accessory SKU.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (a thin metal chain necklace) is exhibiting clear late-spring seasonality and high volatility. Period 15 saw a massive spike in demand to 136 units (up from 69 in P14 and 28 in P13), which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This spike aligns with late May, often associated with graduation season and the lead-up to summer events. The historical lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15). Currently, we have 87 units in-transit (orders from P14 and P15), but we are starting P16 with 0 units on-hand against a very high recent demand trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (averaging ~53 units/week in the last 5 weeks) while using the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand surge confirmed: Demand in late May (P14-P15) jumped from an average of ~17 units to 102.5 units, indicating extreme sensitivity to late-spring retail events.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is experiencing a massive late-spring/early-summer demand surge, likely driven by seasonal retail trends or specific events. Demand in Period 15 was 136 and in Period 16 was 130, compared to an average of ~20-30 in April/early May. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 130 units of demand were lost in Period 16. In-transit inventory is 226 units, consisting of orders from P14 (12 units), P15 (75 units), and P16 (139 units). The P14 order (12 units) is expected to arrive in Period 18 based on the stable 4-period lead time. To capture the high demand and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P14-P16) to reflect this new high-volume regime (average ~111 units/period). Lead time L is set to default (4) as deliveries have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Extreme seasonal demand surge confirmed: late May/early June (P15-P16) demand averaged 133 units, representing an 8x increase over mid-May averages (~17 units) and a 5x increase over April averages (~27 units).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Thin metal chain necklace) is currently experiencing an extreme seasonal demand surge beginning in late May (Period 15). Demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) has averaged 127 units (136, 130, 115), which is a massive increase compared to the averages in April (~27) or early May (~17). This pattern is consistent with early summer retail seasonality for fashion accessories. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (last arrival in P15 adhered to this). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand spike outstripping previous supply. There are 399 units in-transit: P14 (12), P15 (75), P16 (139), and P17 (173). Note that the P14 order is expected to arrive in Period 18 resolution. Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, we must set parameters that prevent stockouts during this peak season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current ~130 units/week volume.

Carry-over insight: Seasonality peak confirmed: June demand for jewelry SKU maintains an extreme high-regime average of ~127 units per week (Periods 15-17), significantly higher than all previous months.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (jewelry necklace) is currently experiencing an extreme high-demand regime, with June demand (Periods 15-18) averaging approximately 120.75 units per week (136, 130, 115, 102). This represents a massive seasonal peak compared to earlier periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant pending demand from previous periods that resulted in lost sales. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated by the P18 message for the P14 order). To capture this peak and avoid stockouts during the (L+1) = 5 period protection interval, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My forecast is (1+L) * 120 = 5 * 120 = 600 units. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the volatility of this extreme high-demand phase. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been stable.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (jewelry necklace) experienced an extreme seasonal demand surge throughout June (Periods 15-18), with demand peaking at 136 units and averaging ~127 units. However, Period 19 shows a significant drop to 43 units, suggesting the late-spring/early-summer peak is winding down. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 32 units on hand and 554 units in transit (ordered during the peak), we have a substantial pipeline. Demand is transitioning from an extreme high of ~130 to a lower, yet still elevated level compared to early spring. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-volume volatility of the last month while starting to acknowledge the downward trend seen in the latest period. This balances the risk of further stockouts if demand rebounds against the high pipeline already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed after June peak: Period 19 demand (43 units) is significantly lower than the Periods 15-18 average (~127 units), though still higher than spring averages (~25 units).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are exiting the high-demand June peak for this necklace SKU. Demand has stabilized significantly lower than the June average (~127 units), with the last two periods (P19-P20) averaging 45.5 units. This matches the 'tapering' insight from Period 20. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 123, with a significant pipeline of 426 units (mostly from large June orders). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1/unit/period) as demand cools further into July, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P18-P20) to capture this downward trend (N=3, mean ~64), which provides a safer buffer than the long-term average while acknowledging that demand is still higher than early spring levels. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility. L is kept at default (4) as performance has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-peak: Late June (P19-P20) demand settled at an average of 45.5 units, down from the June peak of ~127 but approximately double the April/May average of ~20-25 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flirty Linnea necklace has clearly transitioned from a June peak (avg ~127) to a more moderate post-peak regime starting in July. For the last three periods (P19-P21), demand has been 43, 48, and 60 units respectively, averaging 50.3 units. This is significantly lower than the extreme June surge but more than double the prior spring averages. Given we are in early July (2019/7/08), the initial post-peak drop has stabilized into a steady summer demand level. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak stabilization. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in P18, P19, P20, and P21. Current total inventory (on-hand 236 + in-transit 253 = 489) is substantial relative to the current forecast (avg 50.3 * 5 periods = 251.5), so the OR backend will likely order minimally or zero this period to avoid excessive holding costs as demand continues to normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-June peak demand stabilization confirmed: Early July demand (P19-P21) has settled at an average of 50.3 units, down from the June peak of ~127.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this jewelry accessory peaked significantly in June (avg ~127 units) and has since stabilized at a lower but still substantial level. In Period 22, demand was 99 units, which is a resurgence compared to the previous three periods (avg ~50 units). History suggests this SKU is highly sensitive to mid-summer retail volatility. We have 282 units on hand and 108 units in-transit (97 from P19 and 11 from P20). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand in the most recent period (99), I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak average (~63 units/week) while providing a buffer for the recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (390 units) is currently high enough to cover roughly 6 weeks of demand at this rate, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering while maintaining a healthy safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand volatility observed in July: Period 22 demand (99) nearly doubled the early-July average of 50.3 units, indicating continued mid-summer demand sensitivity.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for this jewelry accessory peaked in June (avg ~127 units), but has transitioned into a post-peak July regime. The demand in the last five periods (P19-P23) has been 43, 48, 60, 99, 76, averaging 65.2 units. This is significantly lower than the extreme June peak but higher than previous spring averages. Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (303 units) Following a huge June-targeted replenishment arriving in July. There are 11 units in-transit (ordered P20). Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 314 units. Given \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L) * ~65 = 325, the current inventory level is nearly sufficient for the immediate (L+1) period horizon. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture this post-peak July stabilization while staying conservative since inventory is high.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand in July (P19-P23) is 65.2 units, significantly lower than June's ~127 units but higher than April/May levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. This SKU (Flirty Linnea necklace) recently passed a massive June seasonal peak (averaging ~127 units). In July (Periods 20-24), demand has stabilized at a lower level with a recent average of 60.8 units, though the most recent period saw a drop to 21 units. On-hand inventory is high (293 units) due to large orders placed during the June peak period arriving now. With an average demand of ~60 units and 4 periods of lead time, the required base stock (for L+1=5 periods) is approximately 300-350 units. Given current on-hand (293) + in-transit (55) = 348 units, the system is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the post-peak July stabilization (P19-P24) for both demand and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: July (P19-P24) average demand is 57.8 units, roughly half the June peak but still significantly higher than the spring average (~20 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for this necklace jewelry SKU has shown distinct seasonal behavior: it peaked in June (avg ~127 units), stabilized in July (avg ~58 units), and is now showing a sharp decline in the last two periods (P24: 21 units, P25: 12 units). This mirrors the low-demand regime observed in early spring (Jan/Feb). Current on-hand inventory is 281 units, which is extremely high (covering over 20 weeks of current demand levels). There is a pending order of 55 units from P24 in-transit. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the clear downward trend in demand as we enter August, the priority is to stop ordering and allow the stock to deplete to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current low-regime average (approx 16.3 units) and use default settings for lead time and sigma, which will result in a zero order due to the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonality decline confirmed: Demand in late July/early August (P24-P25) has dropped to an average of 16.5 units, returning to pre-peak levels seen in early spring.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights demonstrate that the necklace SKU experienced an extreme demand peak in June (averaging ~127 units), followed by a moderate stabilization in July (~58 units), and has now significantly declined to a low-regime average of 16.5 units in late July/early August (P24-P26). On-hand inventory is very high at 264 units, which covers approximately 15 weeks of the current demand regime. With 55 units still in-transit (ordered P24, expected to arrive around P28), the total pipeline and on-hand inventory is 319 units. Given the holding cost of $1.00 relative to the $4.00 profit, maintaining excessive inventory in this low-demand phase is inefficient. I will set the mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P24-P26) to reflect the return to pre-peak demand levels, which will signal the OR engine to stop ordering while inventory is being cleared.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear peak in June (average ~127 units), followed by a stabilization in July (~57.8 units), and a significant decline in late July/August (P24-P27 average: 21.5 units). This matches seasonal patterns for a 'flirty' necklace, where demand surges in late spring/early summer and cools off significantly in late summer. On-hand inventory is currently high at 228 units, which is over 10 times the current weekly demand. There is an in-transit shipment of 55 units from Period 24 expected to arrive in Period 28. To minimize holding costs due to the current inventory surplus and the seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 (covering the post-peak period) to reflect the lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are for the first time observing demand post-summer peak for this necklace SKU. Recent demand (P24-P28) shows a significant decrease (21, 12, 17, 36, 70), averaging 31.2 units, which is a departure from the June peak of ~127 units. The most recent demand (70) suggests some late-August volatility, possibly related to back-to-school or end-of-summer promotions, but the overall trend is downward compared to June/July. Currently, on-hand inventory is 213 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. Given the high inventory and the current demand regime (averaging ~31 units), the current stock covers nearly 6-7 weeks of demand. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 5 periods to capture this post-peak stabilization while respecting the recent slight uptick in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-summer: Late August (P24-P28) average demand has dropped to 31.2 units, a ~75% decrease from the June peak, returning to mid-spring levels but remaining volatile.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (jewelry necklace) is exhibiting a late-summer/early-fall demand surge. Period 29 saw a significant demand of 116 units, following a volatile July/August. Historical data shows extreme sensitivity, with demand swings from 12 to 136 units. The current on-hand inventory is 97 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Periods 30 through 34. The recent demand regime (last 5 periods, P25-P29) has an average of approximately 50 units per week, but the most recent period (116) suggests a potential secondary peak or high volatility entering September. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent upward trend and volatility while calculating the base stock. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge detected in late August/early September: Period 29 demand (116 units) is nearly 4x the August average (P25-P28 avg ~34), suggesting a late-summer retail peak or back-to-school influence.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (jewelry necklace) is experiencing a significant secondary demand surge in early September, with demand jumping to 116 units in Period 29 and 127 units in Period 30. This follows a period of lower late-summer demand (averaging ~34 in August) and mirrors the extreme volatility seen during the June peak (avg ~127). The current stock is 0 units due to the surge, and the 122 units ordered in Period 30 are in transit. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P24 order arrival in P28), I need to set parameters based on this current high-demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this intense 120+ unit/week regime, ensuring the OR engine calculates base stock for this level of activity across L+1 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=2 to account for the high volatility during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge confirmed in early September: P29-P30 demand averaged 121.5 units, comparable to the June peak (~127 units) and significantly higher than the August average (~34 units).

Demand in P29-P31 averaged 115.7 units, which is roughly 4x the August average and comparable to the June seasonal peak. This suggests a strong late-summer/back-to-school demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 257 units in-transit (ordered in P30 and P31). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the stockout in P30 and P31, the OR backend must target a base stock that accounts for this high-demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this surge, and sigma_hat using N=3 to account for the heightened volatility during this period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a secondary demand surge (late August/September), with demand in the last four periods (P29-P32) averaging 109.25 units. This follows the June peak (~127 units) and a summer lull. Demand has transitioned from an August average of ~34 to this high regime. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (392 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P24 order arrived in P28). To capture the current surge while acknowledging the potential for a quick drop (as seen after the June peak), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to focus specifically on this high-demand window. This will ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to satisfy current demand once shipments arrive, while the OR backend's capping mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering if the peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: P29-P32 demand averaged 109.3 units, indicating a strong late-summer/early-autumn peak similar in magnitude to the June peak (~127 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, similar to the June peak. Average demand from Period 29 to Period 33 is 110.4 units. My inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and I have had stockouts for the last four periods. There are 528 units in-transit, but the next arrival (ordered in Period 30) is not expected until Period 35 (visible in Period 35's decision phase). To cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), I need to set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=5: Periods 29-33). I am choosing recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean (avg ~110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 28 arrival from Period 24 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The necklace SKU is currently in Period 35 (early October). Historically, demand for this accessory exhibits strong seasonal peaks, notably in June (~127 units/week) and September (~109 units/week). Period 34 demand dropped significantly to 30 units, suggesting the end of the September peak. On-hand inventory is 92, and a large pipeline of 457 units is in transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34), which are expected to arrive in Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38 respectively. The order from Period 30 (122 units) arrived on time in Period 34 (lead time = 4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat to capture the most recent 6 periods (P29-P34) to reflect the recent high-demand regime while the OR backend's cap mechanism prevents over-ordering given the massive pipeline inventory already in transit. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility observed during the September peak-to-trough transition.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge concluded: Period 34 demand (30 units) represents a ~70% drop from the September average (P29-P33 avg ~112), signifying a return to lower baseline demand levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14) finds the SKU entering a post-September surge stabilization phase. Historical data shows two major peaks: June (~127 units/week) and September (~112 units/week). In both instances, demand dropped significantly following the peak. Specifically, the September peak (P29-P33) has concluded, with the last two periods (P34-P35) averaging 23 units. Current on-hand inventory (211) and in-transit units (325) are high due to orders placed during the September surge arriving now. To avoid excessive holding costs in this lower demand regime, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current 23-unit average. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P34 and P35).

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge decline confirmed: Demand in early October (P34-P35) dropped to an average of 23 units, an 80% decrease from the September peak (~112 units), matching post-June peak behavior.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms that the secondary September demand surge (averaging ~109 units) has concluded. In the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has settled to a much lower level (30, 16, 51), averaging approximately 32.3 units. This pattern follows the post-peak behavior observed after the June surge. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 295, In-transit: 190) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower 'winter baseline' demand, preventing further overstocking while holding enough to satisfy current demand and moderate fluctuations. I'm using N=3 because it marks the precise start of the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge decline confirmed: Demand in early October (P34-P36) has stabilized at an average of 32.3 units, down from the September peak (~112 units), following a similar cooling trend to the post-June peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a post-September surge period. Demand for this jewelry SKU (Flirty Linnea necklace) has significant peaks in June and September, both followed by a rapid stabilization to lower baseline levels. Recent demand (P34-P37) has averaged 46 units, though the individual periods (30, 16, 51, 87) show high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently high (344 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the September surge (P30-P33). We have 54 units in-transit (ordered in P34 and P35). LEAD TIME: Observations from P34-P37 confirm that actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. DEMAND: Given we are approaching November, we should anticipate a possible late-year holiday surge, but immediate demand is likely to remain in the post-surge 'cooling' regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the average and volatility since the September peak concluded. The current inventory (344) plus pipeline (54) is 398, which is well above the projected needs for the next 5 periods (L+1), so the OR backend will likely place a zero or minimal order and focus on reducing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge demand (P34-P37) is averaging 46 units, characterized by high week-to-week volatility (ranging 16 to 87).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. We are currently in a post-September-surge cooling phase, with demand in Period 38 (81 units) and Period 37 (87 units) showing some volatility, while the overall October average (P34-P38) is approximately 53 units. This is higher than the early October baseline but significantly lower than the September peak (~112 units). On-hand inventory is high at 314 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the September peak (P30-P34). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Given the high current inventory and the moderate demand trend, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (P34-P38) to capture the post-September stabilization while acknowledging the recent uptick in the last two weeks as we approach the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge demand (P34-P38) has stabilized at an average of 53 units, showing moderate growth compared to the initial October low (~23 units) as November approaches.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are entering the pre-holiday season. Historical data shows that this jewelry SKU (Flirty Linnea necklace) has significant seasonal peaks (June and September). Post-September demand (P34-P39) has stabilized at an average of 49.6 units per week, which is significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~20 units. In the last period (P39), demand was 33 units. On-hand inventory is high at 284 units, significantly exceeding the pipeline and current demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the risk of holding costs, I will use a recent demand window (last 6 periods, P34-P39) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which reflects the post-surge stabilized regime. This will likely result in a zero or small order to burn through existing stock while maintaining a safety buffer for potential late-November holiday demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge demand (P34-P39) has stabilized at an average of ~50 units per week, representing a higher baseline than the spring months (~20-25 units) as the holiday season approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the pre-holiday season. Historical demand for this necklace SKU shows high sensitivity to seasonal events (June peak and September surge). Since the end of the September surge, demand has stabilized at a higher baseline (approx. 50 units/week) compared to early spring. Period 40 demand was low (16 units), but targeting a higher baseline for the upcoming Black Friday and Christmas period is prudent. On-hand inventory is high (268 units), which covers over 5 weeks of the current average demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My parameters maintain the current higher-regime baseline to ensure availability for potential holiday spikes while managing the existing high on-hand levels. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the post-September stabilization (P34-P40) which averages ~45 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are entering the late November/December holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this necklace SKU shows high sensitivity to seasonal peaks (June and September peaks each reached ~127 units/week). The recent post-September average (P34-P41) is ~40.8 units, but the most recent two weeks (P40-P41) have dipped significantly to an average of 14.5 units. Given the transition into the Black Friday and December holiday window, a demand surge is highly probable, similar to the spikes seen earlier this year. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 255), and with a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P42) will arrive in P46 (late December). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the post-September baseline (approx 41 units/week), which allows the OR backend to account for recent volatility while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat for the anticipated holiday surge. The current high on-hand levels will likely be depleted if a June-style surge occurs.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand (P40-P41) has dropped to an average of 14.5 units, though a seasonal holiday surge is expected based on previous SKU behavior.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are entering the peak holiday shopping season for this accessory necklace. Historically, this SKU has shown extreme seasonal sensitivity with two major peaks: June (avg ~127 units) and September (avg ~112 units). While demand in late November (P40-42) dropped to an average of ~14 units, similar low periods preceded previous surges. For Period 43 (early December), I anticipate a significant seasonal holiday spike. However, current on-hand inventory is high (241 units) due to lower-than-expected November demand. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use an 'explicit' value to forecast the holiday surge. Given previous peak magnitudes (~110-130 units), but acknowledging current high on-hand stock and a 4-week lead time, I'll set mu_hat based on an expected average demand of 90 units per week over the next 5 weeks (1+L). This ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level for December without over-ordering excessively given the high starting inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture the higher volatility seen since the September surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season peak anticipated: December demand expected to surge following late-November lows, mirroring June and September seasonal spikes (~110-130 peak levels).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 44 (Dec 9), which represents the height of the Christmas retail season. Looking at historical seasonal surges for this necklace SKU (June peak ~127 units, September peak ~121 units), we anticipate a similar holiday surge in December. Recent demand (P40-P43) has been low (avg ~13 units), which is characteristic of the 'calm before the storm' observed prior to previous peaks. The system already has high on-hand inventory (238 units) and significant in-transit (150 units, mostly from the P43 order of 138). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in early January (P48), which is after the holiday peak. Therefore, we focus on managing the current inventory to satisfy the expected surge in Periods 44-47. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a 4-week peak average of 120 units (120 * (1+4) = 600 total demand over lead+review) and high sigma_hat to reflect historical peak volatility. This will ensure the OR backend protects existing stock levels for the anticipated holiday demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), we are in the heart of the December holiday season. Historical behavior for this jewelry SKU (thin metal chain necklace) shows extreme sensitivity to retail events, with previous major peaks in June (avg ~127) and September (avg ~112). While demand in early December (P43-P44) remained low (avg 11), a massive surge is expected as we approach the final two weeks of the year. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. With 238 on-hand and 339 in-transit (orders from P43 and P44 arriving in P47 and P48), we are positioned for high demand in the next few periods. Given we only have 3 periods left in the game and significant inventory already committed (577 total units against a potential peak demand of ~130/week), I am setting mu_hat using an explicit forecast of 120 units/week for the L+1 window to ensure we cover the holiday spike without over-ordering excessively in the final moments. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the high volatility inherent in these seasonal transitions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical data for this necklace SKU shows extreme seasonal sensitivity, with massive spikes in June (~127 units), September (~112 units), and now December. Period 45 demand just surged to 73 units from 12-unit levels, confirming the expected holiday peak. Given that on-hand inventory is 165 and we have a significant pipeline (411 units, which include large orders from P43 and P44 arriving in P47 and P48 respectively), the goal is to manage the end of the season. Demand typically collapses immediately after a peak (as seen post-June and post-September). Looking at P45 demand (73), I anticipate P46 (Christmas week) to be high or slightly higher (~80-100), followed by a sharp drop in late December / early January. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat and sigma_hat because the automated 'recent_N' or 'EWMA' would either under-react to the current spike or over-order for the post-holiday slump. mu_hat is set to cover 5 periods (L+1) at a blend of peak and post-peak rates: (100 + 40 + 20 + 20 + 20) = 200. This conservative mu_hat prevents excessive ending inventory as the game concludes in Period 47, while the existing pipeline already provides a safety net for any surprise Christmas demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 45 demand surged to 73 units (6x previous weeks). Historical patterns (P15-18, P29-33) suggest this high regime lasts 2-4 periods before dropping by ~70-80%.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of the December holiday peak (Period 47, Dec 30). Demand in the last two periods (P45-P46) has surged to an average of 71.5 units, confirming the anticipated holiday spike. Historical patterns for this necklace (June and September surges) show that these high-demand regimes typically last 3-5 periods before dropping significantly (around 70-80%). Given that we are at the end of December/start of January, I expect demand to remain high for the very beginning of the new year and then rapidly cool. Pipeline inventory is very high (411 units) consisting of orders placed in P43 (138), P44 (201), and P45 (72). The P43 order (138 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 47 (visible in P48). Current on-hand is 95 units. To prevent excessive overstocking as the peak concludes, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current high demand (P44-P46 avg ~52) for the OR engine's base-stock calculation, but allow the system's capping logic to naturally limit new orders since the pipeline (411) already heavily exceeds the likely demand for the next lead time cycle (4+1 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak duration: Demand surged in P45-P46 (avg 71.5). Historical peaks (P15-P18, P29-P33) suggest 1-2 more periods of high demand before a ~75% drop.
