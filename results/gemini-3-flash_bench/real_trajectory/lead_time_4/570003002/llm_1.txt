Total coverage is 0 periods. e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for the period we just missed (the decision is made at the start of Period 1), the current period, plus the lead time of 4 periods. Total coverage needed = Lead Time (4) + 1 (Current Period) + 1 (Safety/Buffer) = 6 periods. Expected demand per period is ~48. Target Pipeline = 48 * 6 = 288.

{
  "rationale": "The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt (Underwear/Jersey Basic). We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Historical analysis shows a baseline demand of ~40-45 units, but with significant spikes around transition periods and potential holiday influence. Period 42 saw a major surge to 99 units (up from an average of ~40), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late November). Given the date (Dec 2) and proximity to the end of the game (Period 47), we must ensure we cover the remaining 5 periods of demand without over-ordering, as holding costs ($1) equal the profit per unit ($1). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Current On-hand is 40. In-transit consists of: P39 (50), P40 (50). Expected arrivals: P43 conclude (P39 order - 50 units), P44 conclude (P40 order - 50 units). Total pipeline (On-hand 40 + In-transit 100) = 140 units. Expected demand for the final 5 periods (P43-P47) based on the holiday surge could be elevated. If demand averages ~50 units/week, we need 250 units total; if it returns to ~40 units, we need 200 units. Currently, only 140 are available for the entire remaining duration. However, any order placed now (P43) will arrive in P47 (the final period) and only be available to satisfy P47 demand. Placing an order of 100 units ensures we don't stock out at the very end if the December holiday demand stays high, while minimizing risk as any leftover inventory at the end of P47 incurs the final holding cost.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand surge confirmed in late November: Period 42 demand spiked to 99 units (approx +150% from the Oct/Nov baseline of ~40). December demand is expected to remain volatile but higher than the autumn baseline.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt, a staple garment. Reviewing the calendar (early December), we are in the peak holiday shopping season. Historical demand shows a significant spike in late November (P42: 99 units), representing a 150% increase over the autumn baseline of ~40 units. While P43 demand dropped to 35, the holiday season typically sees high volatility with multiple peaks. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the lead time, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48, which is after the immediate holiday peak. However, we must maintain stock for the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (44-47). Current inventory: On-hand (55) + In-transit (150) = 205 units. In-transit consists of: P40 (50), P41 (0), P42 (0), P43 (100). Expected arrivals: P44: 50 units (P40), P45: 0 (P41), P46: 0 (P42), P47: 100 (P43). Total stock available to cover demand until the end of the simulation (P47) is the current total pipeline: 205 units. Over 4 remaining periods (P44, 45, 46, 47), an average demand of 50-60 units/week would require 200-240 units. With 205 units already committed and the simulation ending at Period 47, any order placed now (arrival P48) will not contribute to sales or profit but will incur inventory holding costs. Therefore, I will place no further orders.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a men's jersey V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees seasonal spikes during holiday shopping. Historical data and carry-over insights show a significant surge in late November (P42 demand: 99), likely correlated with Black Friday/Cyber Monday events. Following this spike, demand in early December has returned to a baseline of approximately 35-36 units per week. As we are currently at Dec 16 (Period 45), there is a high likelihood of one final pre-Christmas demand spike before year-end. My current on-hand inventory is 69 units. There is an in-transit order of 100 units from Period 43, which is expected to arrive at the end of Period 47 (the final period) and be visible for Period 48. Since the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed now (P45) would arrive in P49, which is beyond the game duration. However, the existing in-transit (100 units) plus on-hand (69 units) provides a total pipeline of 169 units. Given that there are only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), and current demand is low (~36), even a significant holiday spike in the next week would be covered by the 69 units on-hand and the 100 units arriving in P47. Ordering more now would only increase holding costs without contributing to met demand within the remaining timeline.",

However, recent periods (P43-P45) have averaged ~39 units, returning to the autumn baseline. As we approach the end of the year and transition into January, historical data from January 2019 (avg ~47) suggests a stable but slightly higher baseline than the current December weeks.

To cover demand for the next 5 periods (P46-P50) at an estimated average of 45 units/week (totaling 225 units), against current pipeline of 122 (22 on-hand + 100 in-transit), I need to bridge a gap of approximately 103 units to maintain service levels while accounting for potential post-holiday stability.",

Period 46 saw a stockout with demand of 60 and only 22 units on hand, confirming strong end-of-year interest. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory consists of two 100-unit orders: Period 43 order (expected arrival Period 47 conclude, visible P48) and Period 46 order (expected arrival Period 50 conclude, visible P51). To maintain a service level for a 5-period window (lead time L=4 + 1 for current action), at a projected demand of ~60 units/week (based on recent holiday volatility and 2019 baseline shifts), we need roughly 300 units in the pipeline.
