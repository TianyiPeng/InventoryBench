Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT'. Historical demand across the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 47.6 units and a standard deviation of 8.9 units. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible in this limited sample, though it's post-holiday season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My strategy is to set a base stock level that accounts for demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish initial inventory pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for lead time (4 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 63 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, these will not arrive until Period 5. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand inventory to meet the Period 1 demand of 71, resulting in 71 lost sales. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11) shows values: 35, 53, 41, 57, 52, 71. There is a slight upward trend, with the last 4 weeks averaging 57.75. This product (Victor Slim VN T-Shirt) is a basic staple, but demand appears to be growing. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this higher mean (approx 54.8) compared to the full history. With L=4, the system must cover 5 periods (L+1). I'll stick to the promised L=4 as we have no evidence of deviation yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for SKU 570003002. Historical samples show demand rising from 35-57 in January to 71 and 109 in the last two weeks, indicating a significant upward trend or regime shift. Our on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, while 136 units are in-transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we do not expect the first order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5. Based on the recent uptick (average of last 2 actual periods is 90), the initial samples (averaging 47.6) significantly underestimate current needs. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent growth (incorporating P1 and P2 demand plus the latter half of the provided samples) while maintaining some stability. For L, I will stick to the default promised lead time as there is not yet enough evidence to conclude a lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from 47.6 (Jan avg) to 90 (Feb P1-P2 avg), a ~89% increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a Victor Slim VN T-Shirt. Historical demand was approx. 47 units/week in January, but has risen significantly in February to an average of 84.7 units (71, 109, 74). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (63 units), Period 2 (73 units), and Period 3 (110 units) are all currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (P1 order) at the earliest. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing lost sales. The carry-over insight already noted a 90-unit average for early Feb; including Period 3's 74, the last 3 samples average 84.6 units. I will set mu_hat using the average of these 3 periods (84.6 * (1 + 4) = 423) and sigma_hat based on the recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this stockout phase. L remains at the promised 4 periods as no arrivals have occurred to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand in January averaged ~47, but since Period 1 (mid-February), it has surged to an average of 82.75 (71, 109, 74, 77). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 366 units in-transit (63+73+110+120). Since we have 4 periods of data for the new demand regime (Period 1-4), I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time (4) + the review period (1), which is (1+L)*mean_demand. Given high demand and stocking out to date, using the recent mean is appropriate to prevent future lost sales once inventory starts arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1 (Feb): mean demand increased from 47.6 to ~83 (+74%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt. Historically (Jan), demand averaged ~47. Since February (Period 1-5), demand increased to an average of 78 (71, 109, 74, 77, 59). Period 5 saw a slightly lower demand (59) compared to the previous weeks, but the overall mean for the last 5 periods remains significantly higher than the initial January data. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover a 5-period window (L+1). Although on-hand is low (4), there is a large pipeline (351 units) consisting of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. Using the last 5 samples captures the higher demand regime while smoothing out the Period 2 spike. Mu_hat is set to (1+4)*78=390, and Sigma_hat uses the standard deviation of this recent period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We have received confirmation that the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order arrived in P6). Demand for the last 6 periods has stabilized around a mean of 76.6 units (71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70), which is significantly higher than the initial January data (avg ~46). Although there was a spike of 109 in Period 2, the subsequent four periods show stability between 59 and 77. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is low (7), but in-transit (313) is substantial, including orders from P3 (110 units), P4 (120 units), P5 (48 units), and P6 (35 units). The P3 order (110 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P7) and become visible in P8. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now proven, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime (since Period 1) while smoothing out the Period 2 spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals). Stable demand regime confirmed since P1 (avg ~76.6, N=6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a 'VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT', a basic cotton jersey staple. Since the demand regime shift in early February, demand has stabilized. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7), aligning with the promised lead time. In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 41 and 267 units in-transit. Historical demand since the regime change (Periods 1-7) averages 76.6 units per period. Using N=7 for recent demand reflects this post-January shift. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a Men's Jersey V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees consistent demand in spring. Demand history since the regime shift in Period 1 (late Feb) has been stable: P1-P8 demand values (71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70, 76, 72) show a mean of 78.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.2. Arrival history from Period 5 through Period 8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matching the promised lead time). Currently, we have 89 units on hand and 222 units in-transit (orders from P5: 48, P6: 35, P7: 64, and P8: 75). Because the demand and lead time have reached a stable state since the shift, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term historical mean which includes the lower Jan demand samples (35, 53, 41, 57, 52).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Period 1 to Period 8: mean ~78.5, std ~14.2. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck t-shirt. Since the start of February (Period 1), demand has entered a stable regime. Analyzing the demand from Period 1 through Period 9: [71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70, 76, 72, 62], the mean is approximately 74.4 with a standard deviation of 14.8. There is no clear seasonal spike or trend in the mid-April context for this basic item yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-9). I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture this stable post-January regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L since the observed lead times match the promised 4 periods. On-hand plus pipeline (75 + 243 = 318) is being compared against (L+1) periods of demand (~74.4 * 5 = 372), suggesting a need to maintain the current ordering pace to ensure availability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a Men's Cotton V-neck T-shirt. Historical data confirms a stable demand regime starting around Period 1 (post-January), with demand averaging approximately 74 units over the last 10 periods (P1-P10). In the most recent period (P10), demand dropped to 34, which could be noise or a seasonal tapering; however, we rely on the broader regime's average to avoid overreacting to a single data point. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5 through P10). With a lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory state: 76 on-hand + 263 in-transit = 339 total pipeline. Our expected demand over 5 periods is approx 370 units (74 * 5). The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy capped by safety stock logic. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent stable regime (P1-P10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has proven to be stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability (Period 1-10): mean ~74, std ~20. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a Men's Cotton V-neck T-shirt, which typically enters a stable or slightly increasing demand period in spring/early summer. Over the last 11 periods (Feb-April), the demand mean is approximately 74.4 with a standard deviation of 19.3. The most recent demand (P11) was 88, which is slightly above average but within the normal range. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods (validated by 7 consecutive arrivals). I will continue to use recent_N to capture the Feb-April regime. Specifically, N=11 covers the entire period since the initial demand shift in February. Using this data helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against the observed volatility (std ~19) while preventing overstocking as holding costs equal profit ($1.0 each).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt, a basic staple. Looking at the history from Period 1 to Period 12, demand has remained relatively stable within a regime that started in February. Mean demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 73.6 units per week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P1 through P8. Pipeline inventory (233) plus on-hand (38) equals 271 units, which covers nearly 3.7 periods of demand at the current average. Since the required inventory level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand is approximately 368 units (5 * 73.6), we need to continue ordering to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of the current spring regime while excluding the earlier January samples that were significantly lower.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P14 (2019/05/13). The product is a Men's Cotton V-Neck T-shirt. Historically, demand has been stable since P1 (February), with a mean of ~74 units per period (N=13) and a standard deviation of ~19. Late April and May (P11-P13) show demand fluctuating between 46 and 89, which is consistent with the established regime. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). On-hand inventory is 61, with 261 units in-transit (P10-P13 orders). The OR backend calculation for base stock involves (1+L) periods of demand, where L=4. Given the stability of both demand and lead time, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the full stable regime since the February shift, ensuring the backend estimates mean and volatility from a statistically significant sample size.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically exhibits stable year-round demand with slight increases during warmer months. Analysis of the demand history from Period 1 to Period 14 (Feb to mid-May) shows a relatively stable regime since the initial increase in February. Over the last 14 periods, the mean demand is approximately 70.5 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean has been 66.0, indicating no major seasonal surge yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 14), so the system must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory position is: On-hand (55) + In-transit (241) = 296 units. Given the mean demand (~70.5) over 5 periods is 352.5, the current pipeline is slightly lean but within safety stock tolerances given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), suggesting a 50% service level target in a classic Newsvendor sense (though the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy). I will keep L at default (4) and use the last 14 periods (the entire active season since the Feb shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain stability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a men's cotton V-neck undershirt. Historically, lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. In Period 15, on-hand inventory hit zero because the arrival (13 units from Period 11) was insufficient to cover demand (72). As of Period 16 start, on-hand is 0 with 285 units in-transit. The expected arrival for Period 16 (ordered in P12) is 96 units, which should satisfy demand. Since Period 1, the demand has been stable. Analysis of demand from P1 to P15 yields a mean of ~73.1 and a standard deviation of ~18.3. This represents a stable regime. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this post-January regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as the 4-period promise is being met reliably.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand during the summer months. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). Demand has remained stable since Period 1 (post-January shift), with a mean of approximately 71 units and a standard deviation of 17 across the last 16 periods. Period 15 saw a minor stockout (sold 68 out of 72 demanded), but on-hand inventory was replenished in Period 16. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 258) plus current on-hand (13) equals 271, which covers roughly 3.8 periods of average demand (71 * 4 = 284). To ensure adequate stock for the upcoming (L+1) period horizon while managing holding costs (Profit:Holding = 1:1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the post-shift demand regime. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P18 (2019/06/10). The product is a cotton V-neck T-shirt, which is a stable staple item. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P17). Demand since the regime shift in February has been remarkably stable. Calculating demand statistics from P1 to P17, the mean demand is 71.1 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Recent periods (P13-P17) show a mean of 64.4. Given the item's role as a basic staple and the absence of clear seasonal spikes in early June based on the historical data available (Feb to June), I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the full stable regime since the February shift. This N=17 encompasses all data except the very early Jan seeds, providing a robust estimate of mean and volatility. On-hand is 50, and 248 units are in-transit, which covers the ~355 units (5 periods * 71 demand) typically needed for the pipeline. No shipments are currently classified as lost or significantly delayed.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a men's cotton V-neck undershirt, a staple garment with relatively stable demand. Current date is mid-June. Reviewing the demand history from Period 1 to Period 18, the mean demand remains consistently around 71 units per week (avg P1-P18: 71.05) with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. There is no significant evidence of a seasonal trend shift or regime change in the last 10 periods. Lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 18 (Period 14 order arrived). On-hand inventory is low (15 units), but a large delivery (~57 units from Period 15) is expected to arrive during the resolution of the current Period 19. Using recent_N with N=18 captures the stable regime since February, allowing \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the current baseline. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods, considering the ~$1 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24. Demand for this V-neck t-shirt has been consistent since February, with a sustained average of approximately 71 units per week across the last 19 periods (Period 1 to Period 19). The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival from Period 5 through Period 19. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a slight stockout in Period 19 (demand 82 vs. starting 72). However, the in-transit pipeline (282 units) is healthy and corresponds to orders placed in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19. Given the equal weight of profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level for the base stock, though the cap mechanism usually ensures a higher effective safety stock. Since the demand regime (N=19) and lead time (L=4) are both very stable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 to capture the relevant regime after the Jan transition, and 'calculate' for L.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 is currently in a stock-out situation (On-hand: 0) for the second consecutive period, with lost sales in Periods 15, 19, and 20. The current date is 2019-07-01. Analyzing demand from Period 1 to Period 20, the mean demand is approximately 71.3 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. Although the Carry-over Insights previously suggested a mean of ~74-78, the recent 10-period average (P11-P20) is 71.1, showing remarkable stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the backend OR engine will target using the base_stock = mu_hat logic. To ensure we recover from the stock-out and account for the pipeline (288 units in transit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most stable recent demand regime (approx 71 units/week). Setting L to 'calculate' is safe as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt, which generally shows stable year-round demand but has experienced stockouts in Periods 15, 19, and 20 due to slightly higher than anticipated demand spikes and a 4-period lead time. Historical demand since Period 1 (excluding initial Jan samples) has a mean of approximately 71.3 and a standard deviation of 15.1. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (L=4). To ensure better availability and mitigate recent stockouts, I will use recent_N=20 to capture the current stable-but-variable demand regime since February, which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the full pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). Profits and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's capped policy provides additional safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability (Period 1 to Period 21) confirmed: mean ~71, std ~15. Stockouts in P15, P19, and P20 suggest the need for consistent monitoring of the service level vs holding cost balance as inventory is tight.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically has stable demand characteristics outside of major seasonal shifts. Analysis of the demand history from Period 1 through Period 22 shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 70.3 units and a standard deviation of 15.6. While there were stockouts in Periods 15, 19, and 20, these was caused by low arrival quantities (based on previous conservative orders) rather than a spike in demand. The Lead Time has remained perfectly consistent at 4 periods across all 18 concluded delivery cycles. Given the stability over the last 22 periods, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the initial Jan/Feb transition phase. This will ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are calibrated to the actual demand levels of approximately 70 units/period, balancing service levels against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck t-shirt, which typically maintains stable demand during summer months without extreme seasonal spikes. Historical data from the last 23 periods shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 71 units and a standard deviation roughly between 15 and 20. Recent demand (P21-P23) has slightly softened (64, 51, 49), but we must maintain service levels given past stockouts (P15, P19, P20). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Inventory position check: On-hand (49) + In-transit (244) = 293 total units. This covers roughly 4.1 periods of average demand (293 / 71). Given the promised lead time of 4, our 'at-risk' window is L+1 = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable long-term mean while acknowledging the recent slight dip. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 5-period horizon demand (approx 355 units), triggering an appropriate replenishment order to bridge the gap between our current 293 units and the target.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck cotton T-shirt, which typically sees stable demand but can be influenced by summer heat or back-to-school transitions. Reviewing the last 10 periods (P15-P24), demand has averaged 70.2 units per period, while the mean since the regime shift in February remains around 70-71. Recent demand has slightly softened (49, 65 in the last two weeks), but earlier weeks in June/July were higher (82, 76, 64). Actual lead time is confirmed consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of P20's order. On-hand inventory is 59, with 212 units in-transit. To ensure we cover demand during the review + lead time (5 periods total), and given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 0.5 where we aim for the mean), I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while maintaining a stable forecast.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26 (2019-08-05). The product is a jersey basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees stable year-round demand as an underwear/base layer. Since Period 1, the demand has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 70.8 units and a standard deviation of 16.4. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has softened slightly to an average of 54.2, but given the overall stability of the SKU, 'recent_N' with N=20 provides a robust estimate for the underlying demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 93, and in-transit is 201 (comprised of orders from P22-P25: 56+37+43+65). Total pipeline (294) is slightly higher than the 5-period expected demand (~354 units at mean + buffer), but as this is a basic item with equal profit and holding cost ($1), maintaining a safe base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P15, P19, and P20 is prioritized. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-January regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item has been relatively stable since Period 1, with a mean around 68.4 units and a standard deviation of 15.6. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has softened slightly, averaging 50 units (51, 49, 65, 42, 43). This might indicate a post-summer slowdown for this specific basic item. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With 106 units on hand and 179 in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26), the pipeline is well-stocked. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin/low-cost ratio item (q=0.5 but typically high service level is preferred for basics), I will use recent_N=10 to capture the slightly lower recent demand trend while maintaining enough buffer for variance. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times are consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed from P22-P26: average demand decreased to ~50 units compared to earlier average of ~75.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 570003002 (Men's V-neck T-shirt) has exhibited a significant downward trend over the past 6 periods (P22-P27), averaging approximately 47.3 units compared to the previous long-term average of ~71 units. This aligns with the 'demand softening' carry-over insight. Given the current date is August 19th, this reduction may reflect a late-summer seasonal tapering for basic cotton jersey T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. On-hand inventory is currently high (109 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 158 units in-transit (ordered in P24-P27). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs while the demand is in this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this new mean (~47) and variance. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed: Period 22 to Period 27 average demand is 47.3 units, a ~33% decrease from the H1 2019 average of 71 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). Demand analysis shows a clear softening regime that began around Period 22. From Period 22 to Period 28, the average demand is 46.4 units (51, 49, 65, 42, 43, 34, 40). This is a significant decrease from the prior long-term average of approximately 71 units. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs (which equal profit for this SKU), I am adjusting the demand parameters to reflect this recent 7-period window. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 112 units, with 115 units in transit (ordered in P25-P28). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 will align the OR backend's base-stock target with current market reality.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the demand for SKU 570003002 (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) has entered a sustained low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 22 to Period 29 is approx. 44.75 units, a significant drop from the previous average of ~71. The last four periods (P26-P29) show even lower demand (43, 34, 40, 34; mean = 37.75). With 143 units on-hand and 55 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 198), we have more than enough stock to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1=5) periods, which would be approximately 189 units at the 37.75 rate or ~215 at the 43 rate. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability (Period 22 to Period 29) confirmed: mean ~44.8, std ~10.4. This represents a significant sustained decrease from the H1 2019 mean of ~71.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Victor Slim VN T-shirt has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 22 (July/August), with a mean of approximately 44 units and a standard deviation of about 10. The current date is September 9, 2019, which is past the peak summer demand for basic cotton T-shirts in most northern hemisphere markets, supporting the observed demand soften. On-hand inventory is currently high (138 units, covering roughly 3 periods of the new demand regime), and there are 47 units in-transit (ordered in P27, P29, P30). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given that profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over the protection lead time (L+1=5). I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (P22-P30). This will result in a mu_hat of approximately 222 (5 * 44.4) and sigma_hat reflecting the lower volatility, allowing the OR backend to naturally decrease order sizes until inventory levels align with the lower demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 22. From Period 22 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 45.7 units (Sum=457, N=10). This confirms the 'Demand softening' noted in previous insights. The most recent demand (Period 31) spiked to 60, but the overall trend since August remains significantly lower than the H1 average of 71. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 31 arrival from P27). Currently, on-hand inventory (94) plus in-transit (67) equals 161 units. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an estimated mean of 46 units, 5 periods of demand is ~230 units. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent slight increase in volatility (std ~10.4).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-23. We are in a demand regime that shifted lower around Period 22. Looking at the last 11 periods (P22-P32), the mean demand is approximately 44.8 units. The most recent demand (P31: 60, P32: 36) shows some variability but remains within the established range for this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P32's 'arrived=0' is expected as the P28 order with lead_time=4 should arrive during P32 and be visible in the P33 conclusion). Pipeline inventory is 130 units (representing orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). On-hand inventory is 58. Total inventory (188) is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) based on a mean of ~45, but I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current regime's volatility and mean for the OR backend. This maintains a lean inventory while protecting against the slight uptick seen in P31.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'softened' state identified around Period 22. From Period 22 to Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 44 units, a significant decrease from the early 2019 average of 71. In Period 33, the order from Period 28 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 32, and the order from Period 29 (5 units) arrived in Period 33, leading to the current low on-hand inventory of 20 units. However, there are 162 units in-transit (orders from P30-P33), which is more than enough to cover the next 4 periods of demand at the current average rate (~44 * 4 = 176). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will continue using recent demand (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, while the OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally modulate the order size given the high pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 570003002 (Men's V-neck T-shirt) has entered a stable regime since Period 22, with an average demand of approximately 45.4 units per period (P22-P34). The current period is Oct 7, 2019. Historically, this product saw higher demand in the first half of the year (mean ~71), but the recent 13 periods show a clear sustained drop. One shipment (ordered Period 28) has not arrived yet based on the sequence, though P25, P26, P27, P29, and P30 orders have concluded. Specifically, Period 28 had 0 units ordered, so no arrival message was expected for that specific order in P32/P33. However, looking at P32 conclude, arrived=0 units, which matches the 0 units ordered in P28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=13 to capture this lower demand regime (P22-P34). Since Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate using the provided parameters. I will use recent_N with N=13 to calculate demand statistics for the current regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product is a Men's Slim V-Neck T-shirt. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. However, a significant disruption occurred: the order placed in Period 28 (due Period 32) never arrived (arrived=0 in Period 32 conclude). This absence of a 'conclude' message for Period 28, combined with the fact that subsequent orders (P29, P30, P31) have arrived on time, suggests the P28 shipment is lost. The stockout in Period 35 (ending on-hand: 0) is a direct result of this lost shipment. For Period 36, on-hand is 0 and we have 180 units in-transit. To recover from the lost stock and address the current stockout, I will maintain lead-time 'L' at 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat to capture the average demand since the softening started (P22-P35 avg ~42.8), ensuring the base stock level targets the correct demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=14 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 28 (ordered 2019/8/19, expected 2019/9/16) is confirmed lost as subsequent shipments (P29, P30, P31) have arrived while P28 remains outstanding with no conclude message.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the current on-hand inventory is 19 units, with 160 units in transit. Historical demand analysis demonstrates a significant regime shift around Period 22; prior to this, demand averaged ~71 units, while the subsequent 15 periods (P22-P36) have averaged approximately 44.5 units (std ~7.7). This softening of demand is sustained and should be the primary driver for forecasting. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, despite the confirmed loss of the shipment from Period 28 (which should have arrived in P32). Because the shipment was lost and subsequent shipments have arrived consistently as scheduled, I will maintain L at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) captures the stable 'softened' demand regime since Period 22. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the lower demand with sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of stockout (Ending Inventory: 0) as of the end of Period 37, primarily due to an unexpected demand spike to 83 units, well above the recent average of ~45. The lost shipment from Period 28 (as noted in Period 36 carry-over) created a supply gap that has depleted the buffer. We are now entering late October/early November; as a 'soft cotton jersey V-neck T-shirt', demand may fluctuate due to seasonal layering or mid-season sales. Period 37 demand (83) might be an outlier or a new upward shift. I will treat the current demand regime as starting from Period 22 but will use N=16 (approx. P22 to P37) to capture the recent softening while acknowledging the latest spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for delivered orders. The backend must prioritize replenishment to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand volatility detected: Period 37 demand surged to 83 units, exceeding the P22-P36 average of ~44 by 88%. Need to monitor if this is a sustained shift or a one-time spike.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand surge in P37 (83 units) and a moderate demand in P38 (47 units). The period 37 surge likely marks a seasonal shift as we enter November, aligning with late-year retail trends for basic apparel. Over the last three weeks (P36-P38), average demand is 58 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~45. To prevent further lost sales and rebuild safety stock, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this rising trend. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P34 order arrival in P38). Sigma_hat is also set to the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility (83 vs 47). The OR backend's service level target (50% given Profit=Holding=$1) is tight, so providing a more responsive mu_hat is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 37: average demand increased from ~45 to ~58 (+29%) as of Period 39, likely reflecting Q4 seasonality.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019/11/11), the system has experienced stockouts in three of the last five periods (P35, P37, P38, P39). This is driven by a Q4 demand regime shift detected in Period 39, with demand increasing from ~45 to ~58. Despite being a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, significant volatility is present (P37 demand was 83). The loss of the P28 shipment created a supply gap that the OR backend, unaware of the loss, is struggling to bridge. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the higher Q4 average (~52.25) and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for higher volatility (std ~18), which will raise the base stock level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods despite the single lost shipment at P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context (P37-P40) suggests a seasonal lift for the 'VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT' as we enter the Q4 holiday period. While the previous period (P40) demand was 35, the overall average since Period 37 is approximately 51 units, compared to the summer low of ~44. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. However, current on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units) due to stockouts in P37, P38, and P39, caused by the P28 shipment loss. Although 224 units are in-transit, the system needs to maintain a higher base stock level to satisfy the current demand regime (~51/week) while accounting for volatility (sigma). I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the Q4 seasonality (51 * 5 = 255) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Q4 seasonal demand regime confirmed (P37-P40): mean demand shifted from ~44 to ~51 units/period. The previously lost shipment from P28 has caused a rolling inventory deficit, requiring higher orders to rebuild safety stock despite high in-transit volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November). The current demand regime (starting P37) shows Q4 seasonality with a mean of approximately 48.8 units/period (avg of P37-P41). Notably, we are still recovering from the lost shipment of Period 28 (0 units ordered, but essentially a missing pipeline piece since P32 saw arrived=0). On-hand inventory is exceptionally low (11 units), while in-transit is high (204 units), representing the large orders placed in P38 (69), P39 (94), and P40 (18). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the service level requirement is balanced (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), and given the seasonality, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent holiday drift and sigma_hat using the same window to address recent volatility (e.g., the P37 spike). The goal is to maintain the pipeline sufficient to cover demand during the lead time plus one review period.

In Period 42, demand surged to 99 units, the highest since February, confirming a significant Q4/holiday spike. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 6 periods (P37-P42) averages 57.2 units, up from the previous regime of ~44. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical loss of the Period 28 shipment. With on-hand at 0 and a recent demand spike, the focus must be on meeting the elevated holiday demand while accounting for the rolling deficit. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent Q4 shift (avg ~57, which translates to a mu_hat of ~285 for L=4). I will also use N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std \u2248 25.5), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Q4 Demand Surge Confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 99 units. P37-P42 average demand is 57.2 (+30% vs P22-P36). Sustained volatility increase noted (std ~25 vs ~10).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of Q4 seasonality for a T-shirt product. Demand has shown significant volatility recently (99 units in P42 vs 35 units in P43). The average demand from P37 to P43 is approximately 54.3 units, but the high standard deviation (~23.4) and recent 0 on-hand inventory periods (P37, P38, P39, P42) necessitate a cautious approach. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44-P47), we must ensure we don't stock out during the final weeks of the year, while also being mindful of holding costs for remaining stock. The current on-hand of 59 is supplemented by a substantial pipeline of 172 units. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the Q4 mean and increased volatility while avoiding over-response to the single P42 spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December period (Period 45), experiencing Q4 demand patterns. History shows a sustained increase in demand volatility and volume starting from Period 37. Specifically, the P37-P44 regime average is approximately 52 units, with occasional spikes like P42 (99 units). The current on-hand inventory is 41 with a high in-transit pipeline (193 units). Although pipeline inventory is high, a previously lost shipment in Period 28 has created a persistent risk of stockouts during spikes. For lead time, the system continues to demonstrate a stable actual lead time of 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use a N=8 for the recent regime (P37-P44) to capture the Q4 seasonal increase (avg ~52) versus the Q3 low (avg ~44). Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the higher volatility (std ~23) observed in recently concluded periods, particularly the large spike in Period 42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The demand in Q4 has consistently shown higher volatility and mean shifts compared to the Q3 'soft' regime. Looking at the Q4 period (P37-P45), the mean demand is approx 52.6 units (sum=474, n=9), but with significant spikes like Period 42 (99 units). The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 195 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (P37, P38, P39, P42) and the current holiday season (late December), I am using a recent window of 9 periods (the Q4 regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we capture both the higher mean demand and the increased volatility (std dev) to protect against spikes while the backend manages the tradeoff between holding costs and service levels. The 'recent_N' method with N=9 targets the start of the Q4 shift at Period 37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to late December/early January. History shows a sustained Q4 demand regime shift from Period 37 onwards. Specifically, mean demand from P37-P46 is approximately 52.7 units (Sum: 527 / 10 periods), with a notably high standard deviation of 22.2 due to spikes (e.g., P42 at 99 units). The most recent demand (P46) was 60 units, and on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout frequency recently (P42, P46) and the high volatility, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this Q4/holiday regime. This will set a higher base stock to build safety stock and mitigate the impact of the lost shipment from P28 while balancing the holding costs for a product with a 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.
