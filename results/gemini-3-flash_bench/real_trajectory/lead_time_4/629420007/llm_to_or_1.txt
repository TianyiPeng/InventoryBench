Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a women's basic cotton T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but can see minor increases as spring approaches. Historical demand based on the provided samples (last 5 weeks) shows an average of ~100 units/week (119, 73, 98, 97, 113; Mean = 100, Std Dev \u2248 17.5). On-hand and in-transit inventory are currently 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 5 samples to establish a baseline demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) for the OR engine, while defaulting to the promised lead time (L=4) until actual performance data is collected.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The date is 2019-02-18. Looking at the demand history, we have samples: 119, 73, 98, 97, 113, and the most recent demand in Period 1 was 147. This suggests a slight uptick relative to the previous 5 samples (mean ~100). The product is a Women's Jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basic), which generally has stable but seasonally increasing demand as we move toward spring. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, 130 units were ordered and are in-transit. On-hand is 0, and we lost 147 sales in Period 1 because starting inventory was 0. I need to set parameters to recover once inventory arrives and cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean (~108) and provide enough inventory to buffer against the variability (std ~24).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed P1) is not expected until Period 5 (Promised Lead Time = 4). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~100. However, P1 and P2 observed demand were 147 and 214 respectively, showing a significant upward trend as we move towards Spring/Summer, which is consistent with the product 'T-shirt in soft cotton jersey'. I will use a recent N of 3 (including the provided samples) to reflect this rising demand. L is kept at default (4). mu_hat should account for (1+L) periods; since the last two periods show a growth trend (average ~180), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (last 2 provided samples + P1 + P2) to capture the higher baseline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'claudine' is a basic cotton T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions into spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 508 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3, which are expected to arrive in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively (L=4 means an order placed in P1 arrives in P5). Historical demand data and early game observations (P1-P3) show a higher demand average (approx. 180) compared to the initial samples (approx. 96). Specifically, the last three periods recorded demand of 147, 214, and 181 respectively. To capture this recent increase in demand, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. For lead time, I will stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until arrival data confirms otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P1: Average demand increased from pre-game ~96 to ~180 (+87%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's basic cotton T-shirt. Historically (pre-game), demand was ~96. However, in Periods 1-4, demand has been 147, 214, 181, and 110, averaging 163. The dip in Period 4 (110) might be a fluctuation or a sign of stabilization after an initial spike, but it remains higher than the pre-game baseline. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (130 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this period). According to the rules, this arrival will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message read at Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 744 units are in-transit. Since we haven't seen a 'conclude' message confirming arrival yet, we stick to the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent 4 periods of game history (average ~163) to set the base stock for L+1 (5) periods. Calculating mu_hat: 5 * 163 = 815. For volatility (sigma_hat), the standard deviation of the last 4 periods is ~44.5; for 5 periods, this scales to ~99.5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. The promised lead time is 4. The first shipment ordered in P1 arrived in P5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently outpaced the arrivals (P1 order was 130 units, but demand in P5 was 142). The pipeline (In-transit) is 769 units, consisting of orders from P2 (149), P3 (229), P4 (236), and P5 (155). The P2 order is expected during the arrival phase of the current period (P6). Demand since the start of the game (P1-P5) has averaged 158.8 units [(147+214+181+110+142)/5], which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~96). I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift. The goal is to set the base stock to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. With \u03bc \u2248 159 and \u03c3 \u2248 39, target inventory should be around 795 + safety stock. The internal OR logic will compute the order based on this target minus the 769 units in transit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's basic cotton T-shirt. Historical data before Period 1 averaged ~98, but actual demand since start (P1-P6) has averaged ~159 units, confirming the insight from P4. We have experienced stockouts every period since P5 because on-hand inventory is exhausted immediately by demand. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). I expect P3's order (229 units) to arrive in Period 7 resolution and P4's order (236 units) in Period 8. Total in-transit is 720 units (P3: 229, P4: 236, P5: 155, P6: 100). Current on-hand is 0. Demand shows a regime shift compared to the pre-game samples; the last 6 periods show a mean of 159 with a standard deviation of approximately 36. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime, and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 periods is being met exactly.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Period 1-6 average demand is 159, significantly higher than pre-game average of 98. Realized lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's cotton T-shirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses toward summer. Looking at the history, the demand in Period 7 spiked to 260, the highest yet. The mean demand since Period 1 is approximately 173 units/period, while the pre-game mean was ~98. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 -> P5, P2 -> P6, P3 -> P7). On-hand inventory remains 0 because demand consistently exceeds supply arriving from the initial periods. Currently, 634 units are in transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). To ensure coverage over the L+1 = 5 periods, and accounting for the seasonal upward trend and high volatility, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma based on the post-shift window (N=7 periods). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) captures the current higher regime (avg ~173), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) adjusts for the high variance (std ~49) seen in this window.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand volatility increased alongside mean; Period 7 reached a new peak of 260 units. Sustained regime mean (P1-P7) is ~173 vs pre-game ~98.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand has shown a significant upward trend, starting at ~147 in Period 1 and peaking at 311 in Period 8. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 196.8, but the last 2 periods specifically (260, 311) suggest a move into a higher 'Spring' regime as we enter April. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand is 0, with a pipeline of 654 units (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). To prevent further stockouts given the accelerating demand (last period demand was 311), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean of ~197, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation 85). I am keeping L as 'default' (4) as observed lead times match promised lead times exactly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April transition shows sharp acceleration (P7: 260, P8: 311); last 5-period average (197) is double the pre-game baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's cotton t-shirt, currently experiencing a significant spring demand surge. Recent demand (P7: 260, P8: 311, P9: 283) is approximately triple the pre-game baseline (~98). We have consistently stocked out despite arrivals because the arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) were based on much lower forecasts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since demand has dramatically accelerated in the last three weeks, I am using a recent_N calculation with N=3 to capture this new 'high season' regime (average ~285 per week). Setting mu_hat using N=3 will help the OR engine project the (1+L) requirement based on these higher volumes, while sigma_hat (N=3) will account for the increased volatility of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Weekly demand has matured into a 250-310 unit regime for April, up from ~150 in March.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (April 22). The SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently experiencing a strong spring demand surge. Recent weekly demand samples (P7-P10) are 260, 311, 283, and 318, establishing a stable high-demand regime with an average of approximately 293 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals. Although on-hand inventory is 0, a large pipeline of 1,063 units is in transit, with 143 units (ordered in P7) expected to arrive during this period's resolution. To ensure the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime rather than the historical average, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the April 'Spring surge' specifically while maintaining the promised lead time L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand total).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April), managing a basic cotton T-shirt. The data shows a massive seasonal surge as we move into spring. Demand has accelerated significantly: P8 (311), P9 (283), P10 (318), P11 (396). The last 4 periods average roughly 327 units, which is a clear regime shift from the early March average (~150). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently outstripping arrivals (sold = all arrived units). To prevent further stockouts, we must set \u03bc\u0302 based on this recent high-demand regime. Using N=4 (the April surge) yields a mean of 327. Multiplying by (1+L) where L=4 gives 1635. Given the upward trajectory (hitting 396 last period), I will set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to 1750 (approx 350 per week for 5 weeks) to proactively cover the peak. \u03c3\u0302 is set using the standard deviation of these last 4 periods (~47) scaled by sqrt(5), approximately 105. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in Late April: Weekly demand increased from ~300 in early April to nearly 400 (P11=396). Average of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 327 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's T-shirt) is in a strong seasonal uptrend as we enter May. Demand has shifted from ~150 in March to ~300 in April, with a recent peak near 400. In Period 12, demand was 340. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 329.6 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). Given the seasonality of basic t-shirts in spring/summer, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture the current plateau. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for recent high volatility (ranging from 283 to 396). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand (340) exceeded arrival (256); however, a significant pipeline of 1429 units is in transit, which the lead-time and base stock calculation must account for to avoid over-ordering as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~330 units/week during April-May peak (P8-P12 average: 329.6). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (Mid-May). Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has shown strong seasonality. Period 13 saw a significant drop to 193 units after a peak of nearly 400. However, the last 4 periods average (P10-P13) is 311.75 units. I suspect the Period 13 drop might be a temporary fluctuation or a shift in the spring/summer demand curve. Because on-hand inventory is finally positive (144) for the first time since start-of-game due to a large arrival from P9, the OR backend's inventory balancing will be more effective. I will use recent_N (N=6) for demand forecasting to capture the April-May regime (averaging ~307 units) which balances the late April peak and the early May dip. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in May; Period 13 demand (193) was significantly lower than the April average (~330), suggesting a potential transition out of the peak spring surge or a weekly fluctuation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 15). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' rose significantly during April-May, peaking around 400 units, but has cooled in the last two periods (P13: 193, P14: 230). This suggests the spring peak is subsiding or demand is returning to a more moderate level. The current on-hand inventory (241) and large pipeline (1191) necessitate a cautious ordering approach to avoid holding costs, as the pipeline now covers nearly 4-5 weeks of recent demand. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current downward trend from the peak (average ~290) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: May transition: Demand cooled following late April peak (P11=396); the average of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) has declined to 289.75 units from the April peak of ~330.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized following an April peak. Specifically, demand for the last three periods (P13-P15) was 193, 230, and 259 units respectively, averaging 227 units. This is a significant drop from the late April average of ~330-400. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). With 319 units on-hand and 1049 units in-transit (covering orders from P12-P15), we have a substantial pipeline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat. This approach prevents over-ordering as seasonality shifts away from the spring surge.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand from P13-P15 (avg 227) indicates a retreat from the April peak (avg ~330). Actual lead time remains fixed at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant peak in April (averaging ~330 units) followed by a cooling trend throughout May. The last four periods (P13-P16) recorded demands of 193, 230, 259, and 218, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 225 units. We have currently accumulated high on-hand inventory (529 units) because of large orders placed during the April peak arriving now. With an additional 649 units in-transit, our total coverage is very high. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the post-peak stabilization level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture current volatility. Lead time is kept at the default promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: June demand has settled into a regime of ~225 units/week (P13-P16 average: 225.0), down from the April peak of ~330 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this summer cotton t-shirt has clearly peaked in late April (P11=396) and has been steadily declining throughout May and early June. The last four periods (P14-P17) show demand of 230, 259, 218, and 160 units, averaging 216.75 units. This confirms the transition from the spring peak (~330 units) to a lower summer baseline. On-hand inventory is currently high (668 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now. With an in-transit pipeline of 350 units and lead time consistently at 4 periods, we are well-covered for the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the cooling demand trend, and use N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during the peak-to-trough transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed June: Average demand dropped from ~330 (April/May) to ~217 (P14-P17). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is currently high relative to current demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'claudine' soft cotton jersey T-shirts has clearly moved past its April spring peak (~330 units/week) and is continuing a cooling trend through June. Period 18 demand was 124 units, the lowest since early March. The 4-period moving average (P15-P18) has dropped to approximately 190 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 671 units on-hand and 447 units in-transit (Total Position: 1,118), the current inventory is extremely high, covering nearly 6 weeks of even peak-level demand. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the cooling trend and allow the OR backend's capped policy to throttle ordering until existing stock is utilized.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend accelerated in June: 4-period average (P15-P18) fell to ~190 units/week, down from the April peak of ~330. P18 demand (124) is the lowest in 14 weeks.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for the product (Women's Jersey T-shirt) has clearly transitioned out of its spring peak (~330 units) and has significantly cooled during June. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) was 218, 160, 124, and 135, respectively, resulting in a recent mean of 159.25 units. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position is extremely high: On-hand (731) + In-transit (252) = 983 units. This total inventory covers over 6 weeks of current demand, whereas the required target (L+1 = 5 weeks) at the current mean of ~160 units/week is roughly 800 units. To minimize holding costs while demand is at this lower level, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (last 4 periods) and allow the OR engine to wind down the surplus inventory. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: Monthly average has declined to ~160 units/week (P16-P19), representing a ~50% reduction from the April peak of ~330 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has significantly declined from the April peak of ~330 units/week to a June average of approximately 132 units/week (last 4 periods: 160, 124, 135, 109). This indicates a post-spring cooling trend. Currently, on-hand inventory (650) is extremely high, representing nearly 5 weeks of coverage at recent demand levels, and an additional 224 units are in transit. This creates a high holding cost risk. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To manage the overstocking, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the lower volume and reduced volatility of the current June/July regime. Given that pipeline inventory (650+224=874) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1), the OR backend will correctly logic to an order of 0 to draw down the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July transition: Weekly demand has stabilized at ~132 units (P17-P20), representing a 60% drop from the April peak and a significant return toward pre-game baselines.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its post-peak contraction as we move into July. Period 21 demand fell to 81 units, confirming a return toward the pre-game baseline (avg ~98) and a significant departure from the April peak (~330). The last 4 periods (P18-P21) have averaged 112 units. With 569 units currently on-hand and 224 in-transit, our total inventory position (793 units) represents roughly 7 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, the OR backend's service level target is high, but the 'cap' mechanism will naturally prevent ordering since pipeline inventory exceeds the likely base stock level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand contraction continues into July: 4-period average (P18-P21) has dropped to 112 units, successfully reverting toward pre-game baseline levels. Inventory levels are high relative to current demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'claudine' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has continued its sharp decline since the late April peak, settling into a low-volume regime for July. Demand in Period 22 was only 54 units, the lowest since the game began. The 4-period average (P19-P22) is now approximately 95 units, and the 2-period average (P21-P22) is only 67.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 739 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q \u2248 0.8), the system should target a base stock sufficient to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Even at a conservative demand estimate of 100 units/week, 739 units is roughly 7.4 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I am setting L to default (4) and utilizing a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=4) to account for the current low-demand regime (~95/week) while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering due to the high on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in July confirmed: 4-period average (P19-P22) has dropped to 95 units/week, a ~70% reduction from the April peak (~330 units). On-hand inventory is significantly high (739 units) relative to current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-459.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to decline sharply as we progress through July, with the most recent demand observation at 56 units. This confirms a full return to, or even below, the pre-game baseline of ~98 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 683 units, which provides approximately 12 weeks of coverage at current demand levels (~56 units/period). With a lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. Since on-hand inventory + pipeline (683 + 0) far exceeds any reasonable 5-week demand forecast (approx. 5 * 60 = 300), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current low-demand regime (~60-80 units/week) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to the high-demand historical April peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late July: Demand has stabilized at a very low level (~50-60 units/week), significantly below the pre-game baseline of ~98 and far below the April peak of ~330. Currently in an over-inventoried state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-493.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic T-shirt is in a clear late-summer contraction. Period 24 demand dropped to 38 units, and the average of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is approximately 57 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 645 units with zero in-transit, which covers roughly 11 weeks of current demand levels. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are significantly over-inventoried. This over-supply is incurring holding costs ($1/unit/period) that exceed the profit margin ($4/unit) if items sit for more than 4 weeks. To prevent further accumulation and drain the excess stock, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (last 4 periods). This will keep the base stock calculation low, ensuring the OR backend places zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late July confirmed: Demand has dropped and stabilized at ~57 units/week (P21-P24), well below the pre-game baseline of ~98 and the April peak of ~330.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has fully transitioned from its spring peak (~330 units) back down to a low-summer baseline. Current demand is stabilized at approximately 54 units/week (average of P22-P25: 54, 56, 38, 43). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 602 units, which is enough to cover over 11 weeks of current demand, well beyond the lead time of 4 periods. Since the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, maintaining this excess inventory is costly. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to reflect the recent 4-week low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders until the inventory is depleted to a more efficient level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low summer baseline: P22-P25 average is ~48 units/week, approximately 50% of the pre-game baseline and 15% of the April peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a significantly lower regime as summer progresses. Period 26 demand fell to 25 units, the lowest recorded. The average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is approximately 40.5 units, which is well below the pre-game baseline (~98) and far below the spring peak (~330). Currently, on-hand inventory is 577 units, which covers approximately 14 weeks of demand at the current rate (40.5 units/week). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly over-inventoried. The OR backend will naturally zero out orders given the current pipeline and on-hand levels. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current low-demand environment and prevent unnecessary ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low summer baseline: P23-P26 average is ~40.5 units/week (down from P22-P25 average of ~48).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-387.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to reside in a low summer baseline regime. The most recent demand (P27) was 38 units, and the average over the last four periods (P24-P27) is approximately 36 units/week. This represents a significant contraction from the spring peak (~330 units) and is even well below the pre-game baseline (~98 units). With on-hand inventory at 539 units and no units in transit, the current stock level covers approximately 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (539 / 36 \u2248 15). Since the lead time is 4 periods and the required stock-up level (L+1) is only 5 weeks (~180 units), we are significantly over-inventoried. I will continue to set parameters to reflect the current low demand regime to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders until the excess inventory is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for the 'claudine' t-shirt is in a significant trough, consistent with late-summer cooling. Period 28 demand was only 20 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is 31.5 units, down from the pre-game baseline of ~98 and far below the spring peak of ~330. We currently have 519 units on-hand with zero in-transit shipments, meaning our stock covers roughly 16 weeks of current demand at a 4-period lead time. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels drop significantly to avoid excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit/period). Parameters are set using recent_N (N=4) to capture this established low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on older, high-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-summer low: P25-P28 average is ~31.5 units/week, a further decline from the early August baseline of ~40 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's T-shirt) is currently in a late-summer seasonal low. Demand has continuously declined from an April peak of ~330 units/week to a very low late-August baseline. In Period 29, demand reached a minimum of 13 units. The 4-period average (P26-P29) is approximately 24 units/week. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 506 units, representing over 20 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), the priority is to allow on-hand inventory to deplete naturally. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-week regime (N=4) ensures the algorithm recognizes the current low-demand state and avoids triggering new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-season low: P26-P29 average is ~24 units/week, down from the early August baseline of ~40 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the SKU 629420007 (Women's Everyday Cotton T-shirt) has entered a very low late-summer/early-fall trough, with the most recent week showing only 11 units. The 4-period average (P27-P30) is approximately 20.5 units, continuing the decline from the spring peak (~330 units) and the pre-game baseline (~98 units). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 495 units, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Because the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), setting parameters based on recent low demand while having massive on-hand inventory will naturally result in zero orders being placed. This is the desired outcome to minimize holding costs while the excess stock is depleted. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-September low: P27-P30 average is ~20.5 units/week. Significant over-inventory persists (495 units on-hand).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a deep late-season/fall demand trough. Demand has declined from an April peak of ~330 units/week to just 11-13 units/week over the last three periods (P29-P31). The average demand for the most recent regime (P28-P31) is approximately 14.25 units. There is a massive on-hand inventory surplus of 482 units, which, at current demand rates, represents over 30 weeks of supply. Therefore, the strategy remains to halt all ordering to minimize further holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime: L is kept at the default (promised) lead time of 4, mu_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current floor of ~14 units, and sigma_hat is likewise localized. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + pipeline) >> base_stock and will correctly place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-September seasonal floor: P29-P31 average is approx 12.3 units/week, down from the August average of ~30. Significant over-inventory persists (482 units), providing ample coverage for the remainder of the season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this summer-season T-shirt (claudine) has reached a seasonal floor, with recent demand being extremely low (Period 32 demand was 8 units). The average demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) is approximately 11.25 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 474 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 40 weeks, far exceeding the remaining periods in the game (47 total). There are no units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods whenever orders were placed. Given the massive inventory surplus and declining seasonal relevance, I will continue to set parameters to ensure no new orders are triggered, allowing the system to bleed off holding costs. Lead time L is kept at default. Mu_hat is set to the most recent 4-period window to capture the current low-demand floor, and Sigma_hat is set to the same window to reflect reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal floor in late September: P29-P32 average demand is ~11.3 units/week, a 96% reduction from the April peak. On-hand inventory provides excessive coverage for the remaining 15 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has reached its seasonal floor as we approach the end of the game (Period 34 of 47). Recent demand (P29-P33) has been extremely low, averaging approximately 10.8 units per week (13, 11, 13, 8, 9). With 465 units on-hand and 14 periods remaining, the current inventory level provides over 40 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate, which far exceeds the remaining game duration. The primary objective now is to minimize holding costs by preventing any new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods of data to reflect the seasonal floor, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 4. Given the massive inventory surplus (465 on-hand vs. a forecasted demand of ~54 units for the rest of the lead time), the OR backend will naturally correctly order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal floor in late September: P29-P33 average demand is ~10.8 units/week. Significant over-inventory persists (465 units), providing coverage for the remainder of the season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Everyday Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a late-season seasonal floor. Demand for the last several periods has been extremely low: P31: 13, P32: 8, P33: 9, P34: 3. The average demand over the last 4 periods is only ~8.25 units. There is a massive on-hand inventory of 462 units and zero units in transit. Given the current demand levels, the existing stock covers over 50 weeks of demand, far exceeding the remaining 12 periods of the game. My priority remains to avoid any further holding costs by ensuring zero new orders are triggered. I will maintain the L parameter at the computed average and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current seasonal floor. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will naturally result in a zero order as the pipeline (462) is vastly greater than any calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal floor in early October: P31-P34 average demand is ~8.3 units/week, a 98% reduction from the April peak. Massive over-inventory (462 units) persists.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019 (Period 36). Demand for this soft cotton jersey T-shirt has reached a seasonal floor, with the last two periods showing extremely low demand (3 units each). This confirms the end-of-season behavior for the product category. On-hand inventory stands at 459 units, while the average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 5.2 units. At this rate, the existing inventory provides coverage for over 80 periods, far exceeding the 11 periods remaining in the simulation. Consequently, no new orders are required. To prevent any automated ordering by the OR system, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the most recent 5 samples (P31-P35), which include demand values of [13, 8, 9, 3, 3]. This approach ensures the base stock calculation remains significantly lower than the current on-hand inventory, effectively halting procurement for the remainder of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal floor in mid-October: Average demand for P31-P35 is 5.2 units, representing a 98.5% decline from the April peak. Current on-hand inventory (459 units) is sufficient for the rest of the game.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has reached a seasonal minimum as we approach late October. Period 36 demand was only 4 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 5.4 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 455 units, which is extremely high relative to the current demand regime. With 11 periods remaining in the game (ending at P47) and a total projected demand requirement (even at a slightly higher average of 10) far below the current stock level, we should not place any new orders. The goal remains to minimize holding costs while liquidating this excess inventory. Lead time is irrelevant for ordering at this stage due to the massive surplus, so defaults are maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a seasonal floor in mid-to-late October; P32-P36 average demand is ~5.4 units per week, confirming the transition to a low-volume end-of-season state.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's T-shirt) is in a definitive end-of-season state as of Period 38 (late October). Demand has stabilized at a seasonal floor, with the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging only 4.8 units per week (9, 3, 3, 4, 5). Current on-hand inventory is 450 units. Given that there are only 10 periods remaining in the game and the current weekly demand is approximately 5 units, the total projected demand for the rest of the season is roughly 50 units. Therefore, the existing on-hand inventory provides nearly 90 weeks of coverage, far exceeding the remaining game duration. No further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR engine does not trigger any unnecessary replenishment orders while managing the significant holding cost of the excess stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a definitive end-of-season state. Demand has reached a seasonal floor, with the last five periods (P34-P38) showing values of 3, 3, 4, 5, and 5 units respectively. The average demand over these 5 periods is 4.0 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 445 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 100 periods\u2014far exceeding the 9 periods remaining in the game (P39-P47). To maximize the total reward by minimizing holding costs while maintaining a 100% service level for the remaining demand, no further orders are required. The OR parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime and high inventory coverage: 'L' is set to default as lead time is stable, 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' use the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to accurately capture the seasonal floor and prevent the OR engine from triggering any unnecessary safety stock orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal floor in late October/early November: P34-P38 average demand is 4.0 units per week, indicating a near-zero demand state for the remainder of the season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (claudine T-shirt) has stabilized at a seasonal floor as we approach the end of the year (mid-November). Recent demand (P34-P39) has been consistently low, averaging approximately 4 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 441 units and only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, we have excessive stock (enough for over 100 weeks at the current rate). The inventory holding cost ($1.0/unit/period) is a significant drain on profit relative to the unit profit ($4.0). Therefore, the objective remains to minimize or eliminate new orders to avoid increasing holding costs while serving the negligible remaining demand. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat at very low levels using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current seasonal floor, ensuring the OR backend identifies the existing stock as more than sufficient to cover the pipeline target.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Basic T-shirt) is in a definitive end-of-season state. Demand has reached a seasonal floor, averaging approximately 4 units per week over the last five periods (P36-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 438 units, which, at the current demand rate, provides over 100 weeks of coverage\u2014far exceeding the remaining 7 periods of the game. My objective is to minimize further holding costs while ensuring no stockouts occur. Since the system is heavily over-inventoried, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period demand data to reflect the current low-volume reality. I will keep L at the default promised lead time of 4 periods as it is stable. These parameters will result in a zero-order recommendation from the OR backend, allowing the system to bleed off the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: Late Oct/Nov demand has stabilized at ~4 units/week (P36-P40), representing a 99% decline from the spring peak. On-hand inventory (438) provides total coverage for the remainder of the game.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is in a definitive end-of-season state (late November). Demand has been consistently below 10 units per week since late September and has settled at a floor of approximately 2-5 units per week (P38-P41: 5, 4, 3, 2). With 436 units on-hand and only 6 periods remaining in the game (P42-P47), the current inventory covers the remaining demand orders of magnitude over (implied coverage > 80 weeks). To maximize total reward, the objective is to minimize further holding costs while avoiding any new orders. I will maintain mu_hat at near-zero levels using recent demand (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand inventory, effectively suppressing all ordering for the remainder of the session.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in the final phase of its lifecycle, with demand having reached a seasonal floor in early October. Since Period 36, weekly demand has remained extremely low, ranging from 2 to 5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 432 units, while the maximum possible demand for the remaining 5 periods (including current P43) is estimated to be no more than 25-30 units total. This results in a massive inventory surplus. Any additional orders would only increase holding costs without providing additional service level benefit. Therefore, the goal remains to prevent any further ordering by maintaining parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime while the on-hand stock naturally depletes. I will continue using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current near-zero demand floor (~3 units/week) and ensure no new orders are triggered.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47 (December 9). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Demand has effectively reached a seasonal floor, with recent observations being 3, 2, 4, and 0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 432 units, which is massive compared to the remaining demand in the final 4 periods of the game. Total remaining demand is unlikely to exceed 20 units. No further orders are required. The OR parameters will be set to minimums to ensure no new orders are triggered, allowing the system to deplete the existing surplus and minimize further holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 out of 47 (mid-December), approaching the final stage of the game. On-hand inventory is 429 units, while demand has settled at a seasonal floor of approximately 2-4 units per week (the mean of the last 5 periods P40-P44 is 2.4 units). Given that there are only 3 decision periods remaining (P45, P46, P47) and we have over 400 units in stock, we are extremely over-inventoried. The primary objective now is to avoid any further ordering and minimize holding costs, as our current stock covers dozens of years of current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to represent the current near-zero demand floor, which will keep the base stock level significantly below our current on-hand inventory, ensuring no new orders are placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-424.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the game. Current on-hand inventory is 428 units, while demand has settled at a seasonal floor of approximately 0-4 units per week (the average of the last 5 periods is 1.6 units). With only two periods of demand remaining (Period 46 and Period 47) and a massive surplus relative to this demand, no further orders are necessary. The priority is to avoid any additional holding costs while satisfying the remaining negligible demand. I will maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods and set demand parameters based on the most recent late-season regime (N=5) to reflect the current floor, ensuring the OR engine does not trigger an order despite the high service level requirements normally associated with high-profit items.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final decision period (Period 47, Dec 30). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has been at a seasonal floor since October, averaging ~2-3 units per week. With 427 units on-hand and zero lead time remaining for further arrivals to impact the game, we are in a massive over-stock position. No further orders are required. The focus is simply on keeping parameters reflective of the current near-zero demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not place any unnecessary orders, although the high inventory relative to the lead-time demand will naturally prevent any ordering.
