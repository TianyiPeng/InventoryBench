Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans in washed, stretch denim' for ladies, which is a staple fashion item but often sees a rise in demand as spring approaches. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks) shows a significant upward trend: 1, 3, 27, 17, 34. This suggests a demand regime shift occurred around mid-January. I will use the most recent 3 samples (27, 17, 34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (~26) and volatility. Promised lead time is 4. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods ahead. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 will help the OR backend adjust to the most recent demand level without over-smoothing with the very low initial values.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 2019-01-07 (1), 01-14 (3), 01-21 (27), 01-28 (17), 02-04 (34), and most recently 02-11 (43). This confirms a demand regime shift likely driven by the lead-up to spring (seasonal jeans demand) or a successful product launch. Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 43 units of sales in Period 1 because the initial order hadn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4. An order of 41 units was placed in Period 1 and is in-transit (expected around Period 5). To capitalize on the rising demand (mean of last 3 samples is ~31, mean of last 2 is ~38), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth while remaining slightly cautious. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat will use N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting late January/early February: weekly demand increased from <10 to >30 units (sustained for 4 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a massive demand spike. Demand jumped from values near 30 to 179 in Period 2 (Date 2019/2/18). This likely correlates with early spring fashion resets or a specific seasonal promotion for denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 95 units in transit (41 ordered in P1, 54 in P2). With a promised lead time of 4, no arrivals are expected until Period 5. Given the extreme jump in demand (179 units), the previous mean from the first 5 samples (~23) is no longer relevant. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to project a sustained high demand period. I'll estimate the forecast for (1+L) periods, where L=4, totaling 5 periods. Using the recent demand of 179 as a baseline for the upcoming weeks until stock arrives, mu_hat = 179 * 5 = 895. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the volatility seen in this sudden surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected in Period 2: demand jumped to 179 units, likely reflecting seasonal spring denim trends or promotions.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has entered a new demand regime significantly higher than the initial historical data. Demand in the last three periods was 43, 179, and 136 (average ~119 units/week). Previous historical context (Jan/early Feb) showed demand <35. This surge aligns with early spring fashion trends for denim as the weather warms. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised lead time is 4 periods). An order placed in Period 1 (at the start) should arrive during Period 5 (next period) and be visible in Period 6. Total in-transit is 385 units (41 + 54 + 290). To ensure we capture this new demand level while considering the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to focus on the 2019/2/11\u20132019/2/25 surge. I am choosing 'calculate' for L as we haven't confirmed any delivery timing yet, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Spring denim demand regime confirmed: avg demand surged from ~20 to ~120 units/week starting mid-February 2019.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', a spring-relevant fashion item. Historical data showed a demand shift from ~30 to ~120 units/week starting in mid-February. Last period (Period 4) demand was lower (67), but the overall trend remains much higher than the initial January baseline. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) should arrive during Period 5 (this period) and be visible in the Period 6 start message. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (L+1=5), I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for demand to capture the higher volume observed since the Feb 11 shift. Mean demand over the last 4 weeks is (43+179+136+67)/4 = 106.25. Setting L=4 (default) and using recent_N=4 for demand and volatility ensures the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to satisfy this new higher-demand regime while we await the arrival of the 619 units already in transit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which aligns with spring fashion demand in March. Since 2019-02-18, demand has stayed elevated compared to January, averaging ~104 units/week (179, 136, 67, 35) but showing a downward trend from a very high peak. The Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) with 608 units in transit (ordered in P2, P3, P4, P5). We expect the P2 order (54 units) to arrive this period (P6). Given the volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand spring regime while acknowledging the recent cooling from the peak. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand regime remains significantly higher than Jan base, though tapering from February peak (Avg ~100 vs <30).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is low (8 units), but a large pipeline (585 units) is incoming. Orders from P3 (290 units) and P4 (234 units) are expected in Period 7 and Period 8 respectively. Demand history shows a massive surge in February (179 down to 67 units) followed by a stabilization in March (35, 52 units). The recent average demand since the surge (P3-P6) is approximately 72.5 units/week. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observed lead time. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization, providing a lookback period that includes the lower March figures while respecting the higher spring floor. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the current volatility in the 'spring' regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand has settled into a lower volume (avg ~45 last 2 weeks) compared to February's surge (>100), but remains higher than January baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens Denim) has entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the high-demand period in February. Demand over the last three weeks (P5-P7) has been 35, 52, and 41, averaging approximately 43 units per week. This is significantly lower than the February peak (>100) but higher than early January. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 all showing exactly 4 periods. We currently have 257 units on-hand and 295 units in-transit (P4-P6 orders), totaling 552 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand mean of ~43, we have roughly 12 weeks of coverage. The OR engine's capped policy will naturally limit ordering since pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock calculation. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the stabilized post-peak demand level, and L will be calculated based on the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: avg demand settled at ~43 units/week (P5-P7) following the February seasonal peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees a seasonal peak in early spring (February/March). History shows a clear surge in February (P2: 179, P3: 136) followed by a stabilization/tapering in March and early April (P5-P8 demand: 35, 52, 41, 99). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 57 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (392 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the February peak. With 392 units on-hand and 61 in-transit, we have sufficient stock to cover over 7 periods of demand at the recent average rate. Therefore, the OR backend should minimize further ordering. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect the current stabilized demand level (approx 57/week) and use default calculate for lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), the on-hand inventory is 390 units following the arrival of the large orders placed during the February peak. Demand has stabilized post-peak, with the last two weeks showing demand of 99 and 32 units, following a regime that averaged approximately 43 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9 arrivals all showing lead_time=4). With 390 units on hand and 31 units in transit (due to arrive in P10 or P11), the inventory position is significantly high relative to the current demand regime. The OR backend will likely calculate a base stock lower than the current pipeline inventory, resulting in a zero order, which is appropriate given the current surplus. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the post-peak stabilization (excluding the extremely volatile Feb data) and 'calculate' for lead time since observed data is consistent with the promised lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Historical data confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods is accurate (orders from P1-P6 all arrived with a 4-period lead time). The demand regime has transitioned from the February peak (avg > 100) to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 4 periods (P7-P10), demand has been 41, 99, 32, and 23, averaging approx 48.75 units. However, the sample of 99 in Period 8 appears to be an outlier or a brief spike compared to the surrounding weeks (32, 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 398 units with no further units in-transit. Given the stabilized demand and high on-hand inventory, the priority is to avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in a high inventory state with 374 units on hand and 0 in transit. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 7, demand has shifted into a lower, stable post-peak regime. In the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has been 32, 23, and 24 units, averaging 26.3 units per week. The previous 'stabilization' noted in the Carry-over (avg 43) has further declined. At the current demand rate, the 374 units on hand cover approximately 14 weeks of supply, which is significantly more than the (L+1=5) period target coverage. Since on-hand inventory is already high (374) and total pipeline required (base_stock) is likely much lower (~130-150 units based on recent demand), the OR backend will correctly result in 0 orders units (final order = min(base_stock - 374, cap)). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent downward trend in demand since the seasonal peak concluded (P8-P11), and 'calculate' for L to remain consistent with observed arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand has further stabilized to a lower level of ~26 units/week (P9-P11), down from the previous secondary baseline of ~43 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ankle-length jeans' is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a significant demand surge in February and March. Based on the most recent five periods (P8-P12), the demand has settled into a new lower regime with an average of approximately 40 units/week (specifically: 99, 32, 23, 24, 22). However, removing the outlier from P8 shows a very stable recent demand of ~25 units/week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high (352 units), which is sufficient to cover over 10 periods of current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed in the history. Given the high stock position and the holding cost ($1/unit), the primary goal is to allow current inventory to deplete naturally. Parameters are set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent stabilization at around 25-40 units/week while the OR engine's capped policy will result in zero new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). After the significant spring peak in February and March, demand has continuously tapered off. The last three periods recorded demand of 24, 22, and 8 units, indicating the end of the seasonal peak for this specific denim item. On-hand inventory is very high at 344 units, which is significantly more than the current demand run-rate of approximately 18 units/week (last 3 weeks avg). With zero in-transit and a promised lead time of 4 periods, existing stock covers nearly 20 weeks of demand at current levels. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this low-demand regime and lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observations. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) >> base_stock and will naturally order zero units, minimizing further holding costs while liquidating existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: significant drop to single digits (8 units), confirming the end of the spring seasonal cycle. Average demand (P11-P13) has dropped to ~18 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for these ladies' denim ankle jeans, with a peak in February followed by a gradual decline and stabilization. The most recent demand samples (P11-P14: 24, 22, 8, 23) indicate a current demand regime averaging approximately 19.25 units per week. The system is currently holding 321 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the current inventory level covers over 16 weeks of demand (321 / 19.25), which is far beyond the (L+1) horizon of 5 weeks. No new orders are needed. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime using a recent window (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation aligns with the post-peak environment, allowing the backend to naturally draw down existing stock before ordering more.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) has exited its spring seasonal peak. History shows a clear downward demand trend: from February's peak (>100 units), demand stabilized to ~43 units in March/April, and has settled into a low regime of ~18 units/week over the last 5 periods (P11-P15). Current on-hand inventory is 303 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a weekly demand of ~18, the current safety stock (303 units) covers approximately 16+ weeks of demand, which far exceeds the required inventory level for a 4-period lead time plus a cushion. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime using recent_N=5 (P11-P15 avg: 19 units) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we burn through significant existing excess stock. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~19 units/week (P11-P15) following the end of the spring seasonal denim cycle.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Ladies Denim) observed a sudden and significant demand spike in Period 16 (93 units), compared to the previous stabilization at ~19 units/week. This spike suggests a potential summer promotion or late-spring resurgence. The item is an 'Ankle-length' jean, which is seasonally appropriate for June. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is high (210 units) because of over-purchasing during the February peak. Current on-hand (210) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods), even accounting for the recent spike (5 * 93 = 465 is unrealistic, more likely a mean of 40-50). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since on-hand is already sufficient for at least 4-5 periods of demand at the high-end rate, no new order is required. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to mix the low baseline with the recent spike, and sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility to ensure reasonable safety levels in the OR calculation.

Carry-over insight: Inconsistent demand spike detected at Period 16 (93 units), interrupting the previous low-demand regime of ~19 units; monitoring to see if this represents a new summer sustained trend or a one-off hit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P16: 93 units, P17: 69 units) indicates a significant upward shift from the previous regime of ~19 units/week. This shift coincides with the transition into June, likely representing a summer retail surge for light-wash denim or ankle-length jeans. The on-hand inventory has dropped rapidly from 303 to 141. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sharp change in both mean and volatility. This helps the backend calculate a higher base stock level to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed at Period 17: weekly demand increased to avg ~81 units (P16-P17) from the previous May low of ~19 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a sustained summer demand surge that began in late May (Period 16). Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 93, 69, and 52 respectively, averaging approximately 71 units per week. This follows a significantly lower May baseline of ~19 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P6). With on-hand inventory currently at 89 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we are at risk of a stockout before the orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 arrive (expected P21 and P22). To capture this higher demand regime and ensure the OR backend generates sufficient replenishment orders, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to isolate the current summer surge (P16-P18). This prevents the lower historical data from depressing the forecast during this peak. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge sustained: Average demand for Period 16-18 is ~71 units/week, a significant increase from the May baseline of ~19 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late June (2019/06/24). A summer demand surge was confirmed starting in late May (Period 16), which has remained sustained through Period 19. The last four periods (P16-P19) show demands of 93, 69, 52, and 68 units, respectively, averaging approximately 70.5 units per week. This is a significant increase from the May low (~19 units) and reflects seasonal demand for 'Ankle-length jeans' during warmer weather. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 orders all arrived at L=4). Although in-transit inventory is high (235 units), these orders (placed in P17, P18, P19) are not due to arrive until P21, P22, and P23. With only 21 units on hand and a weekly demand average of ~70, there is a nearing stockout risk for the current period before the next batch arrives. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand summer regime, and maintaining the promised lead time of 4 as it is supported by historical evidence.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (skinny ankle jeans) is currently in a sustained summer demand regime that began around Period 16 (late May). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 76 units/week (93, 69, 52, 68, 99). The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 20 where demand (99) exceeded supply (21). While 334 units are in-transit, the first significant restock ordered during this summer surge (124 units from P18) is not expected until Period 22 conclude (visible in P23 decision phase), following the confirmed 4-period lead time. To address the current stockout and the ongoing high demand (average 76), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the summer trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this period (ranging from 52 to 99). Lead time 'L' remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Periods 16-20) documented with average demand of 76 units/week, significantly higher than the May baseline of 19 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained summer demand surge (Periods 16-21), with demand exceeding 100 units in the most recent period (P21: 132 units). The average demand over this 6-period regime is approximately 85 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P20 and P21, losing significant sales. The promised lead time of 4 periods is holding steady (P17 order arrived in P21). To rebuild inventory and match this high-demand regime while balancing the service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=6 to capture the entirety of the current summer surge. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at the current high demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Periods 16-21) average demand further increased to ~85 units/week, with the most recent sample at 132 units. Stockouts occurred in P20 and P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans. Recent demand (P16-P22) has averaged ~87 units/week (93, 69, 52, 68, 99, 132, 97). The stockouts in P20 and P21 indicate that recent demand likely would have been even higher if inventory had been available. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (P21 and P22 arrivals confirmed this). We currently have 27 units on-hand and 358 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22). The pipeline is already substantial (358 units) relative to the 5-period risk window (L+1). To stabilize at the current regime without incurring excessive holding costs once the summer peak ends, I will use a recent_N approach. N=7 covers the entire summer surge starting from the P16 shift. This will calculate the mean demand based on the 87 units/week average, while the OR backend's capping mechanism will prevent over-ordering if the pipeline is already sufficient to meet the base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 16 onwards) sustains an average of ~87 units/week, with high volatility and stockout incidents in P20-P21.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained summer demand surge for this denim item. Analyzing the demand regime from Period 16 to 23, the average demand is approximately 91.25 units per week (93, 69, 52, 68, 99, 132, 97, 126). The volatility is high (standard deviation ~26). We have experienced stockouts in Periods 20 and 21 due to late ordering relative to this new demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 21, 22, and 23. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), and there is a significant pipeline of 353 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels through the (L+1) period cycle (5 weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the start of the summer surge) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This method will calculate parameters based on the current regime (avg ~91 units), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers approximately 455 units (5 * 91) plus a safety buffer for the high volatility, while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a higher sustained average of ~91 units/week with significant volatility (std ~26).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained summer demand regime that began around Period 16 (late May). The average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 89.3 units per week, significantly higher than the May baseline of 19 units. The most recent demand was 74 units, following a peak of 126. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P21, P22, P23, and P24). Pipeline inventory is high (393 units), but given a 4-period lead time and high demand (L+1 = 5 periods of cover needed), we must ensure the base stock levels remain sufficient. I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the summer regime in P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the higher mean (89.3) and volatility (std ~26.4) of this period to minimize stockouts which occurred in P20-P21.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Based on demand history and carry-over insights, SKU 636323002 is in a sustained high-demand summer regime that began around Period 16 (late May). Analysis of the last 10 periods (P16-P25) shows an average demand of approximately 90.4 units per week, significantly higher than earlier months. Demand specifically for the most recent 10-week window (N=10) captures this summer trend effectively while smoothing out the volatility observed since June (range: 52 to 132). Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P21-P25). Given the item's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend base-stock calculation will target a high service level (~80th percentile). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples, we ensure the OR engine recognizes this elevated demand regime and volatility for the look-ahead period (L+1=5 weeks), avoiding the stockouts experienced in late June.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed summer demand regime average of ~90 units/week (P16-P25), significantly higher than May baseline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in a sustained summer demand regime that began around Period 16 (late May). Analysis of the last 11 periods (P16-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 91 units per week, significantly higher than the spring baseline. The most recent demand (P26) was 94 units, confirming this high-volume stage is still active as of early August. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consecutive arrivals (P22-P26). With only 1 unit on-hand and 403 units in-transit, the system needs to maintain a high base stock level to satisfy the current mean demand of ~91 units and account for the observed volatility (std ~24). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this entire summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L to utilize the consistent lead time history.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The 'Summer demand regime' (Period 16 onwards) is well-established, with demand consistently averaging around 90 units per week. The last 10 periods (P18-P27) show a mean of 92.1 units and a standard deviation of approximately 24. Since the lead time has stabilized at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P21-P27), I will use N=10 for both demand and inventory parameters to capture the high-volume summer trend while mitigating the influence of earlier low-demand months. Pipeline inventory is currently 396 units against an on-hand stock of 23, which is sufficient relative to the base stock needs for a 5-period horizon (L+1) (~460 units), but continued ordering is necessary to maintain the flow given the high turnover.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. The 'Summer demand' regime for this SKU (Ankle-length jeans) has been remarkably stable and sustained since Period 16 (mid-May). Analyzing demand from P16 through P28, the average weekly demand is approximately 88 units (Total 1144 / 13 periods). Recent demand (P24-P28) has shown slightly higher activity with levels of 74, 90, 94, 79, and 102. Given we are approaching the end of August, demand for ankle-length denim often transitions into autumn trends, but there is no statistical evidence of a slowdown yet; P28 recorded the second-highest demand of the summer at 102 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by every order since P17). I will set L to 4 using 'calculate'. For mu_hat, I will use a window of 13 samples (recent_13) to capture the entire summer regime, which averages ~88 units per week, providing the OR engine with a target based on the current sustained behavior. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 13 periods to capture the observed summer volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in its summer demand regime, which has been sustained since Period 16 (mid-May). The demand for the last several periods has been consistently high: P25 (80), P26 (94), P27 (79), P28 (102), P29 (80). The average demand over the last 14 periods (P16-P29) is approximately 88.5 units/week. Recent volatility is present but manageable. Looking at the calendar (September 2nd), we are entering the transition from summer to autumn. Historically, this SKU saw a significant drop in demand in May after a spring peak, suggesting seasonal sensitivity. However, for the immediate planning horizon (L+1 = 5 weeks), the current summer/back-to-school demand level is the most reliable predictor. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established high-demand regime while filtering out the older low-demand May data. This will ensure the backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover ~90 units/week while factoring in the high variance (std ~23) observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 16 to Period 29) remains stable with an average of ~89 units/week and consistent lead time of 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU 636323002 (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) has been in a sustained summer/early autumn demand regime since Period 16 (mid-May). From Period 16 through Period 30, the average demand is approximately 87 units/week. However, the most recent demand (Period 30) dropped to 57 units, and the average over the last four periods (P27-P30) is 79.5 units, suggesting a potential slight tapering as we move further into September. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals (P26-P30). I will use a recent window of 15 periods (N=15, covering P16-P30) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the sustained behavior better than the full history, while still providing enough data to smooth out the inherent volatility (~26 std). I will use the calculated lead time method since performance has been stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows that the summer demand regime (approx. 90 units/week) is winding down as we enter September. Demand in Period 30 dropped to 57 and Period 31 to 37, indicating the expected post-summer seasonal decline for Ladies Denim. Using the last 3 periods (P29-P31: 80, 57, 37) gives an average of 58 units/week, which is more reflective of the current downward trend than the full summer average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals in P21-P31). mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the recent deceleration in demand while still maintaining sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increasing volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Summer peak has concluded; demand has decelerated from ~90 units/week to ~47 units/week (avg P30-P31) as of mid-September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) is currently experiencing a post-summer demand deceleration. Comparing the summer peak average of ~90 units/week (Periods 16-29) to the most recent three periods (P30: 57, P31: 37, P32: 36), there is a clear downward shift to an average of ~43 units/week. This aligns with standard seasonal transitions for denim in mid-September. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. Current inventory position (On-hand: 191, In-transit: 217) is quite high (408 units) relative to the new demand levels. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat to match the current 3-period regime (approx 43 units/week, which is 215 for the 1+L window). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to adjust to this lower, less volatile stabilization level while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand deceleration confirmed starting Period 30: Average weekly demand dropped from ~90 to ~43 units (52% decrease) as the summer peak ended.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim has clearly decelerated as the summer season concluded in September 2019. Over the last four periods (P30-P33), weekly demand has dropped to an average of 42.5 units (57, 37, 36, 40), down significantly from the summer peak of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (245 units) due to the arrival of summer-sized orders (P28 and P29 shipments) during the demand downturn. With 245 units on-hand and another 123 units in-transit, our pipeline significantly exceeds the current demand requirements for the next (L+1) periods (approx 42.5 * 5 = 212.5 units). Therefore, I am maintaining the mu_hat and sigma_hat settings to reflect this new lower demand regime (using N=4) to prevent further overordering while the OR backend burns through the excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We have confirmed a significant demand deceleration starting in Period 30 (September), where demand dropped from a summer high of ~90 units/week to a steady average of ~37 units/week over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 57, 37, 36, 40, 34). This corresponds to the end of the summer denim cycle. On-hand inventory is currently high (286 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during the high-demand summer regime. Given that the current average demand is ~37 units and we have 286 units on-hand plus 48 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 334), we have approximately 9 weeks of stock at current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further bloating of inventory and minimize holding costs while demand remains in this lower-stabilized regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this post-summer stabilization (Avg ~37, Std ~9). This will likely result in zero orders until the pipeline inventory is absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed at Period 34: Average weekly demand has held steady at ~37 units (P31-P34) after the initial drop in Period 30.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime following a peak that ended in early September. The average weekly demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is approximately 36.6 units (37, 36, 40, 34, 36), showing very low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently high (298 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during the higher-demand summer regime. Given the current average demand and a lead time of 4, the total inventory pipeline needed (L+1 periods) is approximately 183 units (5 * 36.6). Since current on-hand inventory (298) already exceeds this requirement and there are no further in-transit units, the OR backend will naturally suppress ordering. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized lower-demand regime (P30-P35) while maintaining lead time at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout history.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a post-summer baseline of approximately 34 units/week based on the last 7 periods (P30-P36). Specifically, demand samples for P30-P36 are [57, 37, 36, 40, 34, 36, 24], showing a consistent decline then stabilization compared to the summer high of ~90. We are currently holding an on-hand inventory of 274 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a weekly mean demand of roughly 34 units, the current stock on-hand is sufficient to cover approximately 8 weeks of demand (274 / 34 \u2248 8). Since the total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock level (which covers 1+L = 5 periods), the backend OR engine will correctly calculate an order of 0 to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized post-summer regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime since early September. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand has averaged 34.6 units per week with a low standard deviation. Our current on-hand inventory is 239 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory level, we have enough stock to satisfy demand for approximately 7 weeks (239 / 34.6 \u2248 6.9). Since our pipeline inventory plus on-hand (239) is already greater than the expected base stock for a (4+1) window (which would be around 34.6 * 5 = 173 units), the OR backend will correctly result in zero new orders to avoid excess holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this stable post-summer regime (starting from P30) and 'calculate' for lead time as it remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the product (Ladies Denim Trousers) has stabilized significantly following the summer peak which ended around Period 30. For the last 8 periods (P31-P38), demand has averaged approximately 33.3 units per week, with a consistent downward trend toward late autumn levels of 25-35 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 214 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~33 units, our inventory of 214 units covers more than 6 periods of demand (214 / 33.3 \u2248 6.4). Therefore, no new order is required. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-summer stabilization regime for demand parameters and maintain the 'calculate' method for lead time as it remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P31-P38) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~33 units/week, down from ~90 units/week in the summer peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The demand for product 636323002 has stabilized at a 'post-summer' regime since Period 31 (Sept 9). Over the last 9 periods (P31-P39), the average weekly demand has been approximately 32.2 units (samples: 37, 36, 40, 34, 36, 24, 35, 25, 29). On-hand inventory is currently 185 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L) of 4 periods, the base stock target (mu_hat) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 32.2 = 161 units. Since our current on-hand inventory (185) already exceeds the required base stock for this regime, the OR backend will correctly result in an order of 0. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this stable post-summer demand regime and default settings for lead time and sigma, allowing for efficient inventory depletion while maintaining a buffer.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has remained stable in a post-summer regime since Period 31 (early September). For the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average demand is 32.0 units per week. Although the most recent sample (P40) was 24, the previous samples have fluctuated between 24 and 40 units. We are currently in a high-inventory state (161 on-hand) relative to this demand, but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a pipeline to cover future needs as on-hand stock depletes. The order for 55 units placed in Period 40 is scheduled to arrive in Period 44. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this stabilized post-summer demand level (~32 units/week), which results in a base stock target of roughly (1+4)*32 = 160 units. Since current on-hand (161) + in-transit (55) = 216, the OR engine will likely not place a large order this period, which is appropriate given the surplus.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a post-summer stabilization that began around Period 31 (Sept 9). Between Periods 31 and 41, demand has been extremely consistent, with an average of approximately 32 units/week (min 24, max 40). We are currently in the pre-holiday season, but the product (Ankle Queens High Waist Skinny Jeans) has not yet shown a significant 'Black Friday' or holiday spike in the most recent Period 41 data (demand = 31). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 130, and there are 55 units in transit (ordered P40, expected P44). Total pipeline inventory is 185. Given the stable demand of ~32/week and a lead time of 4, the (L+1) coverage requirement is roughly 160 units. With 185 units already in the system, we are slightly over-stocked relative to current demand, but close to the target. I will use the recent_N method (N=11, covering the stable period since P31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain this service level without over-ordering before confirmed holiday demand shifts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU shows significant seasonal shifts: a spring peak in Feb/Mar, a summer surge from June through August, and a stabilization period in the fall. The most recent demand at Period 42 was 62 units, a notable increase from the previous 8-week average of ~29 units. This likely signals the start of a holiday/winter demand increase for denim, similar to the surge seen in late spring. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across the entire history. With 68 units on-hand and 55 in-transit (ordered P40, expected P44), and a detection of a new upward trend, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent lift (avg ~39/week) while remaining cautious of over-ordering. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility (24, 31, 62).

Carry-over insight: New demand shift detected at Period 42: demand increased to 62 units from a 10-week average of ~29, likely signaling the start of a seasonal holiday/winter trend for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the December holiday period (Current Date: 2019/12/9). Historically, we saw a demand surge in Period 42 (62 units), followed by a lower realization in Period 43 (24 units). This suggests increased volatility typical of seasonal transitions. The 'Winter/Holiday' trend appears to be establishing a higher mean than the previous baseline (~30), but with significant noise. To account for this, I am using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat (covering Periods 41-43) to capture the recent spike while smoothing the individual period volatility. Calculation of N follows the rule: max(min(regime_length 3, 20), 3) = 3. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P22-P35). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect the increased holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand shift: Period 42 (62 units) and Period 43 (24 units) indicate a move away from the stable ~30 units/week baseline, with increased volatility (+100%/-60% swings).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the pre-holiday/winter period (mid-December). Demand has become more volatile as of Period 42, with a spike to 62 followed by drops to 24 and 15. The 'Carry-over Insights' suggest a shift in regime starting Period 42. Based on the 2019/12/16 date, we should expect potential holiday demand or a clearance cycle soon, though the most recent two weeks (24, 15) were lower than the spike in P42. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). To handle the recent volatility and the risk of a late December holiday surge while avoiding overstocking on a low-margin product ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the shift from the stable ~30 baseline to the new volatile state (P40-P44 average demand is ~31.2, but includes the P42 spike). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to bridge the previous stable period and the recent fluctuations.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the holiday season. Recent demand has been volatile (P42: 62, P43: 24, P44: 15, P45: 21). While P42 suggested a seasonal spike, the subsequent three weeks have returned to a lower range, averaging ~20 units/week (P43-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 63, and there are 135 units in transit (73 units from P43, 62 units from P44). Given a 4-period lead time, the P43 order is expected to arrive in Period 47 conclude, and the P44 order in Period 48 conclude. The total pipeline (198 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 6-7 weeks of demand even at a slightly elevated holiday mean of 30 units/week. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the recent volatility and the slight downward trend since the late November spike, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the single P42 outlier while maintaining a safe service level for the remainder of the holiday period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 47 (2019/12/30). Historically, this SKU (denim jeans) shows significant seasonal volatility. After the summer peak (avg ~90), demand stabilized at a lower level (avg ~30). Recent 'holiday' activity (P42=62, P43=24) suggested a potential upward shift, but the last three periods (P44=15, P45=21, P46=11) show a sharp decline, likely representing the typical post-holiday retail lull or the end of a winter cycle. In-transit inventory remains high (135 units) consisting of orders from P43 (73 units) and P44 (62 units), which are expected to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively. With 52 units on hand and 135 coming, my pipeline for the next 4 periods (L=4) is 187 units. Given the most recent 3-period average is ~15.7 units and the 5-period average (P42-P46) is ~26.6, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to cautiously account for the recent instability while avoiding over-ordering during the current downturn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: Demand has dropped to an average of ~15.7 units/week (P44-P46) after a brief holiday spike in P42.
