Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 685816001 (Ronny Reg RN T-Shirt). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are 36, 56, 33, 45, 42. Mean = 42.4, Std Dev = 9.13. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In the base stock model (L+1 periods), the backend uses (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 0. Initial parameters should reflect the known historical average and variance to establish a baseline. Since no arrivals have occurred, L='default' (promised 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all available samples (N=5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt. In Period 1, demand was 88 units, but since starting on-hand was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in 88 lost sales. An order of 58 units was placed in Period 1 (in-transit). Promised lead time is 4 periods, so this order is expected in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 36, 56, 33, 45, 42 (Mean approx 42). However, Period 1 demand spiked to 88. This might be a shift or a one-time outlier. Given we have a stockout, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (including the P1 spike) to be cautious. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean of (36, 56, 33, 45, 42, 88) = 50. Expected demand for 5 periods = 250. Standard deviation is roughly 19.5, so sigma_hat over 5 periods is approx 43.6. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the recent spike without over-correcting too aggressively while we wait for lead time arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because initial demand (88 in P1, 113 in P2) exceeded zero stock, resulting in lost sales. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Promised lead time is 4. Historical demand reflects a significant step up: the 5 historical samples averaged ~42, but P1 and P2 observed demand of 88 and 113. This suggests a regime shift or seasonality for this 'Men Underwear' T-shirt. I am setting L to default (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the higher demand levels seen in P1 and P2 (avg ~100.5), which results in a base stock covering (1+4)*100.5. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase detected starting 2019-02-11 (Period 1): demand rose from a pre-game average of 42 to 100.5 (+139%) in the first two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand but is currently showing a strong upward trend. Historical demand samples (avg ~42) have transitioned into significantly higher actual demand in Periods 1-3 (88, 113, 135). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 112, showing a clear growth trajectory. On-hand inventory is 0 due to the 4-period lead time; the first shipment (ordered Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Total in-transit is 272 (58+84+130). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime. Given the consistent growth (88 -> 113 -> 135), a simple average of 112 might slightly under-forecast, but the 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat will provide an appropriate safety buffer. Lead time is set to default as we haven't reached the promised 4-period delivery window for the first order yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 1nd (88), 2nd (113), and 3rd (135) show an average of 112, confirming a significant shift from the pre-game baseline of 42. No arrivals yet, consistent with promised 4-period lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The first order placed in Period 1 (58 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in the next conclude message. Current inventory is 0, with 423 units in-transit. Demand since the start of the game (Periods 1-4) has been 88, 113, 135, and 83, averaging 104.75 per period. This is a significant shift from the pre-game baseline of 42. Late February (Periods 2-3) saw a peak, while Period 4 showed a slight cooling (83). As we enter March, a jersey basic t-shirt often sees rising interest. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no arrivals have occurred yet to confirm or deny the promised lead time, I will stick to the default L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 105 (Periods 1-4) compared to pre-game avg of 42, showing significant increase for this Jersey Basic T-shirt.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first arrival occurred in Period 5: 58 units ordered in Period 1 arrived exactly after 4 periods (promised lead time). This confirms the lead time L=4. Demand history shows a clear regime shift from the pre-game average (~42) to the game periods (88, 113, 135, 83, 69). The mean demand over the five game periods is 97.6. However, demand has trended downward in the last two periods (83, 69) as we move further into March. This product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which usually sees stable demand but can fluctuate with early spring seasonality. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 50%, making it essential not to overstock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the game-time average while reflecting the recent cooling, and L=4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand regime during game (P1-P5) averages 97.6, significantly higher than pre-game baseline, but showing recent normalization in P4-P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). This matches the promised lead time. The demand regime has shifted significantly since the start of the simulation. Pre-game demand averaged 42.4. In-game demand (P1-P6) has averaged 90.8 (88, 113, 135, 83, 69, 57). However, there is a clear cooling trend over the last three periods (83, 69, 57), where the average has dropped to 69.7. We are currently holding 27 units on-hand with 404 units in the pipeline (orders from P3-P6). With a lead time of 4, our 'at-risk' period is L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=6 captures the entire in-game performance to stay responsive to the higher-than-baseline mean while acknowledging the recent volume reduction. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures we capture the high variance seen during the first few weeks of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend: Average demand for P4-P6 is 69.7, compared to the P1-P3 average of 112. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the demand for the Ronny Reg RN T-shirt continues to settle into a lower-intensity regime compared to the initial game peak. The demand for the last three periods (P5-P7) was 69, 57, and 55, averaging 60.3 units per period. This is a significant drop from the average of 112 seen in P1-P3. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived with L=4). However, with 298 units in-transit (P4=151, P5=101, P6=22, P7=24) and 102 units on-hand, we currently have a pipeline of 400 units. Against a forecast of ~60/period (covering L+1=5 periods which equals 300 units), the pipeline is already over-saturated. Holding cost is high ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is only 50% (z=0). My parameters aim to prevent further over-ordering while the seasonal peak subsides. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the cooldown trend while acknowledging the slightly higher baseline compared to pre-game data (42).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further downward: P5-P7 average demand is 60.3, a 46% decrease from the initial P1-P3 peak (avg 112).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (concluded), demand spiked to 104 units after a period of downward cooling (avg ~60 in P5-P7). This 'Men Underwear | Jersey Basic' item is showing volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as seen in arrivals for orders from Periods 1 through 4. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 149 units, with 147 units in transit (101 from P5, 22 from P6, 24 from P7). Given the recent demand jump, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture both the low period and the recent spike (average demand P4-P8 is 73.6), providing a more responsive buffer than the long-term average while accounting for current stock-on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility detected: Demand spiked from an average of 60.3 (P5-P7) to 104 in P8, suggesting the cooling trend may be reversing or fluctuating.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' has shown a significant surge, spiking to 187 in Period 9, following a spike of 104 in Period 8. This indicates a second growth phase, possibly seasonal as we approach late April. The average demand for the last two periods (P8-P9) is 145.5, which is significantly higher than the previous 'cooling' average of 60.3 observed in P5-P7. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 63 and a target coverage for L+1 (5 periods), I need to account for this higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this immediate surge while setting L to 'calculate' based on confirmed historical performance. Sigma_hat is set to the recent period to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge detected starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): 2-period average jumped to 145.5 units (+141% from the P5-P7 average of 60.3).

LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand surge that began in Period 8. The recent 3-period demand average (P8-P10) is 129.7, compared to the previous cooling period (P5-P7) average of 60.3. This second demand surge is likely driven by the transition into spring for this basic jersey t-shirt. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). However, the system is currently under-supplied because the orders placed during the 'cooling' phase (P6, P7, P8) were small (22, 24, 0 units respectively). Consequently, arrivals in P11 (the P7 order) and P12 (the P8 order) will be minimal. I must maintain a high mu_hat based on the current surge regime (N=3) to ensure that the large orders placed in P10 and P11 cover future demand, while the OR backend's cap mechanism prevents over-ordering relative to long-term pipeline capacity. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * ~130 = 650.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge confirmed: P8-P10 average demand is 129.7 (+115% vs P5-P7 baseline of 60.3). Supply gap imminent in P11-P12 due to low order volumes in P7-P8.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a significant second demand surge starting Period 8 (2019-04-01) for this Jersey Basic T-shirt. The average demand from Periods 8-11 is 136.25 units, which is a massive increase over the previous cooling period (approx 60). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and have been losing sales in Periods 10 and 11 because arrivals from previous low-order periods (P6 and P7) were insufficient to meet this resurging demand. The lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. Since we have a stockout and a high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current 4-period average of 136.25 units multiplied by (1+L), which is (5 * 136.25) = 681.25. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for the high volatility observed in this surge (range 98 to 187). This should trigger the OR backend to place aggressive catch-up orders to mitigate the current supply gap.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge (Period 8-11) confirmed at an average of 136.3 units (+126% vs P5-P7 baseline). Severe stockouts occurring in P10-P11 due to earlier under-ordering during the P5-P7 dip.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a second demand surge that began around Period 8. The average demand for the last five periods (P8-P12) is 138.6 units, compared to the initial baseline of 42 and the mid-game dip of 60.3. Currently, the SKU is facing a severe stockout (on-hand = 0) because of low order volumes in Periods 7 and 8. The stockout in Period 12 underscores a supply gap, as no units arrived (Period 8 order was zero). The Lead Time is confirmed as 4 periods (P11 arrival = P7 order). To recover service levels during this surge, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current high-demand regime. The L parameter's 'calculate' method is appropriate given the consistent 4-period lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P8-P12 average demand is 138.6 units (+130% vs P5-P7 dip). Supply chain recovery in progress as larger orders from P10-P11 are expected to arrive in P14-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 8-13) shows a high average of 131 units per period, with significant stockouts in Periods 10-12 due to earlier under-ordering. Period 13 saw a slight demand cooling to 94 units, but this still represents a higher baseline than the pre-game period. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0), but expect a large arrival of 243 units (ordered P10) in Period 14. To maintain service levels during this second high-demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P8-P13) to capture the current regime which averages ~131 units, resulting in a base stock targeted at (1+L) * 131. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (Period 8-13) maintains an average of 131 units, though Period 13 showed a potential softening to 94 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (April). The last 7 periods (P8-P14) show an average demand of 132 units. Although Period 13 saw a dip (94), Period 14 rebounded to 137. The current on-hand inventory is 106, with a large inflow of 212 units (ordered P11) expected to arrive during the current period (P15) and be visible in the next report. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stockouts experienced in P10-P13, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~132) while avoiding the lower demand seen in early March. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~130 unit/period consumption rate over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685816001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (early April). The mean demand from Period 8 to Period 15 is approximately 134 units per period (104, 187, 98, 156, 148, 94, 137, 147), which is significantly higher than both the pre-game average (42) and the Period 5-7 lull (avg ~60). Period 13 showed a slight dip (94), but the last two periods (137, 147) confirm that demand remains strong heading into June. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P11 ordered arrived P15). With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, because the OR engine uses total history by default, I must use recent_N to force the forecast to stay aligned with the current high-demand cycle. I'm choosing N=8 to cover the entire current regime since Period 8. Pipeline inventory (155+11+35+141=342) plus current on-hand (171) is 513 units. Expected demand over lead time + review period (5 periods) at ~134/unit is 670 units, suggesting we are currently slightly under-provided for the next month.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Period 8-15) confirmed with an average of 134 units per period. Retail seasonality for basic T-shirts is holding strong through May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt in June, which remains a peak demand period. Recent demand (Period 16) was 199, which is a significant spike above the already high average of 134 for Periods 8-15. The demand regime starting from Period 8 shows a mean of approximately 142 units (calculated over P8-P16). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical concludes from P1 to P12. On-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 344 (orders from P13-P16). mu_hat should reflect the current high-demand regime (L+1=5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the second demand regime (starting Period 8) while excluding the previous cooling period.

Carry-over insight: Second high-demand regime (starting P8-P16) maintains a high average of 142 units, with P16 peaking at 199. Seasonality for cotton T-shirts remains elevated in June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' (Jersey Basic cotton T-shirt) remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (early April). Demand in Period 17 was 143 units, following a peak of 199 in Period 16. The average demand for the most recent regime (P8-P17) is approximately 141.6 units. We are currently in June, a peak season for cotton T-shirts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). Despite recent arrivals, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to high demand exceeding the small P13 delivery (11 units). Large orders from P14 (35 units - expected P18), P15 (141 units - expected P19), and P16 (157 units - expected P20) are in transit. To maintain the service level during this sustained high-demand summer period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this regime accurately, and sigma_hat similarly to account for the increased volatility (e.g., the P16 spike).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P8-P17) confirmed with an average of 141.6 units per period, showing strong summer seasonality for basic cotton T-shirts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime driven by summer seasonality (June). Since Period 8, the average demand has been approximately 140 units. Periods 17 and 18 experienced stockouts (starting inventory was less than demand), indicating that our pipeline needs to be robust to capture this seasonal peak. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). Demand over the last 11 periods (P8-P18) averages 131 units, which is a better anchor for the current regime than the full history. We will use N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-volume summer baseline while acknowledging the volatility seen in recent weeks (ranging from 94 to 199). The goal is to maintain a high base stock to minimize further lost sales, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), requiring a 50% service level by default but the backend cap and our parameters will aim for higher availability during this peak.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (starting P8) remains stable through Period 18, averaging 131 units, confirming strong summer seasonality for basic cotton T-shirts. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). The SKU (cotton T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Since Period 8, demand has averaged approx 142 units per period (P8-P19), with recent spikes (P16: 199, P19: 201). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. An order from P16 (157 units) is expected to arrive during P20 resolution, potentially leaving us short again if the high demand sustains. The pipeline (in-transit) is 560, consisting of orders from P16-P19. For Period 20, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=12, covering P8-P19) which captures the current seasonal level better than the long-term average. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (SD \u2248 40 during this regime), sigma_hat is set to default to cover the calculated variance across the game history, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand summer regime (P8-P19) remains stable with an average demand of 142 units per period, showing significant spikes in June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for this Jersey Basic T-shirt. The average demand since Period 8 is approximately 144 units, and the most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) show an even higher average of 172 units, with a peak of 216 in the most recent period. Although there is currently 0 on-hand inventory, we have a significant pipeline of 569 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P19 and P20). To maintain a high service level given the recent demand surge and the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the base-stock formula, though the backend's capped policy will adjust this), I will set mu_hat based on the recent regime. Using N=13 (covering the period since the start of the second surge in P8) provides a stable estimate of the current high-demand level (avg ~144), which should be sufficient to recover from current stockouts while accounting for the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High-demand summer regime (P8-P20) average demand has shifted to ~144 units per period, with a specific peak in June (P16-P20) averaging 177 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08 (Period 22). The SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Recent demand from P16-P21 shows a volatile but high average (199, 143, 128, 201, 216, 158), averaging 174.1 units per period. The 'Carry-over Insights' also reflect this shift, with Period 21 noting a peak average of ~177 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (551 units) is high, reflecting aggressive orders placed in P18-P21 (171, 29, 166, 185) to meet this summer peak. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are identical, the engine targets a 50% service level. However, to avoid stockouts in a high-variance environment, I must accurately reflect the recent mean and volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering the June/July peak) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand distribution, while keeping L at 'calculate' as lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime (P16-P21) confirmed: average demand increased to 174.1 units (+20% vs P8-P15 average of 144).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 164.7 units, with significant peaks reaching over 200 units in June. Though Period 22 showed a dip to 108 units, this follows a high-demand period and often masks latent demand or reflects typical weekly fluctuations within a high-volume season. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 108 and in-transit at 614, we must account for the high average demand of ~165 units over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) captures this high-demand summer peak, while sigma_hat (N=7) accounts for the recent high volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers the expected demand during the replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime (P16-P22) average demand identified at 165 units, showing high volatility (range 108-216).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Jersey Basic Round-necked T-shirts' has transitioned from a summer peak (Avg ~174 in P16-P21) to a cooling trend in the last two periods (P22-P23: 108 and 99). This aligns with the natural end of the high-summer peak in mid-to-late July. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units, and pipeline inventory is 687 units. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. To prevent overstocking during this cooling phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent softening while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. I'll use recent_N with N=8 (covering P16-P23) for mu_hat to capture both the peak and the subsequent drop, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected post-summer peak: P22-P23 average demand fell to 103.5 units compared to the P16-P21 peak average of 174 units (-40%).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (2019/7/29), we observe a sustained demand softening following the summer peak identified in late June and early July. The demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) has averaged 103 units, a significant drop from the P16-P21 average of 174 units. This aligns with the end of the summer season for basic cotton T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P20 order in P24. Currently, there are 102 units on-hand and 579 units in-transit (orders from P21-P24). My strategy is to reduce mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime, preventing excessive inventory accumulation as the season winds down. This set of parameters balances the current stock-on-hand and high pipeline with the lower expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend post-summer peak: P22-P24 average demand is 103 units, a 41% decrease from the peak average of 174 (P16-P21). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has entered a significant cooling phase following the summer peak (June/July). Average demand from Period 22-25 is approximately 97 units, compared to the peak average of ~174 units (P16-P21). Period 25 specifically saw demand drop to 79 units, confirming a downward trend as summer ends. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (208 units), and with 394 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak), we are at risk of overstocking if parameters aren't adjusted to the lower demand regime. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new lower-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer in case the drop is less severe than the last few weeks suggest.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: average demand for P22-P25 is 97 units, a 44% decrease from the P16-P21 peak average of 174 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' (Jersey Basic) has clearly entered a post-summer cooling phase. Demand has dropped from a peak average of 174 units (P16-P21) to 86 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), with the most recent observation being 65 units. Current inventory status: On-hand is 377 units, and 160 units are in-transit (orders from P23-P24). Since lead time L=4, my base stock target (covering 5 periods of demand) needs to be reconciled against a projected demand of ~70-80 units/period. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 537 units. At an average demand of 80, 5 periods requirement is 400; at 70, it is 350. We are currently overstocked due to the high-volume orders placed during the July peak arriving now. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current downward trend and volatility, allowing the OR engine to pause ordering (by setting a high L and capturing the lower mean) until on-hand levels normalize against the lower late-summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase confirmed: Average demand for P22-P26 is 86.6 units, a 50% decrease from the P16-P21 summer peak (avg 174). System is currently overstocked with 537 total units relative to the new demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' is in a clear post-summer cooling phase. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P22-P27) is 90 units, a 48% decrease from the summer peak average of 174. At the start of Period 28, on-hand inventory is 392 units with 58 units in-transit (ordered P24, due P28), totaling 450 units. With an expected demand of ~90 units/period and a lead time of 4 periods, we need approximately (4+1)*90 = 450 units to satisfy the pipeline and protective stock. Since we already have 450 units (392 on-hand + 58 in-transit), the current inventory is sufficient for the next 5 periods. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this cooling regime accurately. This will prevent further over-ordering while the system burns through existing stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/8/26 (Period 29). We are in a post-summer cooling phase for this men's basic T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the June/July peak (avg ~174). The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 85.25. On-hand inventory is 340 units, and there are 0 units in-transit (as the last order was placed in P24 and arrived in P28). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~85, the total required stock is approximately 425 units. Since we currently have 340 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have a slight deficit relative to the anticipated 5-period demand plus a safety buffer. However, because holding costs are equal to profit ($1), the OR engine's critical ratio (q = 0.5) will target the median demand. I am setting L to the consistent actual lead time of 4, mu_hat to the recent average of the last 7 samples (P22-P28, avg 93.3) to capture the full cooling regime, and sigma_hat to the recent volatility of those 7 samples.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase confirmed: Average demand for P22-P28 is 93.3 units, compared to the P16-P21 peak average of 174 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ronny T-Shirt has transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 174 units/period) to a stable post-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last 8 periods (P22-P29) has averaged 93.5 units, with the most recent sample at 98. This confirms a sustained regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 242 units, and in-transit is 121 (ordered in P29), totaling 363 units. Given the new demand mean (~93.5) and the coverage requirement for L+1 (5) periods, the target base stock is approximately 467 units. The current total inventory (363) is below this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the current cooling regime's statistics while filtering out the summer peak volatility, allowing the OR backend to recalculate the optimal order balance for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P22-P29) confirmed: average demand is 93.5 units, a 46% reduction from the summer peak average of 174 units (P16-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ronny RN T-Shirt has finished its summer peak (avg ~174 in P16-P21) and has settled into a post-summer regime. For the last 9 periods (P22-P30), demand has averaged 93.1 units with relatively low volatility. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures this current state accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current total inventory (On-hand: 152 + In-transit: 226 = 378 units) is being managed down from a surplus and now aligns with covering approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~93/period). No immediate aggressive ordering is needed, but we provide consistent parameters to the OR backend to maintain the base stock level for the current 93-unit regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has transitioned into a post-summer cooling phase. From Period 26 to 31, demand has been remarkably stable, averaging 91.5 units per period (65, 87, 110, 98, 90, 89). This is a significant drop from the summer peak average of 174 units. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture this recent stability while smoothing the transition from the peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the history. On-hand inventory is currently low (63), but the in-transit pipeline (314 units) is substantial, including orders from Periods 29-31. Setting L=4, mu_hat with N=10, and sigma_hat with N=10 will allow the OR backend to target a base stock of roughly (1+4)*92 = 460 units, which is appropriate given the current pipeline and the need to prevent overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P22-P31) is stable at an average of 92 units, approximately 47% lower than the summer peak. Seasonal cooling is fully confirmed.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has stabilized in a post-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P22-P32) is approximately 91.5 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak of 174. Period 32 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 401 units in-transit. The orders arriving in the next few periods (from P29-P32) are expected to fulfill the backlogged and upcoming demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the base stock policy handles by setting the target inventory to approximately (L+1) * mean_demand. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable cooling regime while ignoring the previous summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Following the significant cooling trend from the summer peak (avg ~174), demand has settled into a steady range over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), averaging approximately 92.5 units per period. The recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~93.4 units, confirming this consistency. On-hand inventory is currently low (11 units), but arrivals are now resuming after the strategic ordering pause between P25-P28. The P29 order arrived in P33 (lead time = 4), and the P30 order (105 units) is expected in P34. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 333 units, covering roughly 3.6 periods of the current demand regime. To maintain a safe stock level and avoid stockouts as previously experienced, I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the stable autumn regime, while keeping L at the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P22-P33) remains stable at an average of 92.5 units per period, consistently ~47% lower than the summer peak (avg 174). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ronny Regular RN T-Shirt has remained stable within the 'post-summer cooling phase' established in Period 22. From Period 22 to 34, the average demand is 91.8 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak of 174 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of Period 30's order exactly 4 periods later in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 33, with 346 units in transit (specifically, orders from Periods 31, 32, 33, and 34). Summing pipeline + on-hand (33 + 88 + 87 + 53 + 118 = 379), the inventory position is roughly 4.1 periods of the current average demand (91.8). Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 covering the entire post-peak regime (P22-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level targets this lower, stable demand while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility within this regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' (Jersey Basic) has stabilized into a post-summer cooling regime. Since Period 26, demand has consistently averaged approximately 93 units per week, which is a significant drop from the summer peak average of ~170. The current date (Oct 14, 2019) suggests we are firmly in the autumn season, where demand for basic cotton T-shirts typically remains steady or slightly declines before any holiday-related shifts. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. The current total inventory position (On-hand: 23 + In-transit: 337 = 360 units) provides approximately 3.9 periods of coverage at the current demand rate (~93 units/period). To maintain a base stock level that covers L+1 periods (5 periods) and buffers against volatility, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering demand from P22 onwards) to capture the current stable cooling regime while ignoring the previous summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), the demand regime for the Men's Jersey Basic T-shirt has stabilized in its post-summer cooling phase. Since Period 22, demand has averaged approximately 92.5 units, which is a consistent and sustained shift from the summer peak (avg 174). The most recent period (P36) saw 61 units, and the last five periods (P32-P36) average 86.4 units, suggesting a potential further softening as we move into late October. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P29-P32 orders). On-hand inventory is 49, and pipeline inventory (arrivals for P37-P40) is 350 units (P33: 53, P34: 118, P35: 79, P36: 100). Total inventory (399) covers approximately 4.3 periods of recent average demand (~92). To avoid overstocking in a cooling market while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent window (N=15) for demand mean and volatility, which captures the post-peak stability (P22-P36). Using L=default matches the proven 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime (P22-P36) is stable with an average demand of 91.3 units, approximately 48% lower than the summer peak (P16-P21). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) remains in a stable post-summer cooling regime. Since Period 22, the demand has averaged approximately 91-92 units per period, showing significant but expected reduction from the summer peak (avg 174). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in recent arrivals from P29-P33). Inventory is currently well-managed with 22 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit (P34-P37 orders). Since demand is stable and the mean is consistent over the last 16 periods (P22-P37), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to capture this entire cooling regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/4 (Period 39). The product is a Men's Basic T-shirt reaching the end of the game (Period 47). Since Period 22, demand has transitioned from a summer peak (~174 units) to a stable post-summer cooling regime, averaging 91.3 units (P22-P36). Most recent demand (P34-P38) has been slightly lower, averaging 77.4 units. On-hand inventory is 65, with 307 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 9 periods remaining in the game (P39-P47) and a 4-period lead time, orders placed now will arrive in P43, leaving only 4 periods of sales to recover costs. I will set L to 'calculate' (stable at 4). I am using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire post-summer cooling regime (P22-P38) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this normalized lower demand. This will help the OR backend avoid over-purchasing as the game concludes, minimizing holding costs for ending inventory while maintaining sufficient service levels for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling regime (P22-P38) is confirmed stable with an average of 90.1 units, effectively half of the summer peak. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' remains in the post-summer cooling regime, which has been stable since Period 22. Over the last 18 periods (P22-P39), the average demand is 88.3 units. More specifically, the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) show an average of 82.0 units with relatively low volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Current inventory position: 80 units on-hand + 299 units in-transit = 379 units total pipeline. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~82, the total requirement is approximately 410 units. Our current pipeline of 379 is slightly below this, which is appropriate given the slight downward trend in the most recent samples. I will use a N=10 period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization while maintaining lead time at the calculated average.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). The demand for this jersey basic T-shirt is in a clear post-summer cooling phase. Comparing recent intervals: the P16-P21 summer peak averaged 174 units, while the P22-P40 period has averaged 86.8 units. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show a deeper softening (75, 64, 30), with P40 being particularly low at 30 units. This suggests we are moving from a steady 'cool' regime into a late-autumn/winter 'low' regime. Total inventory (on-hand 150 + in-transit 230 = 380) already covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand (~87 units). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. To prevent overstocking during this seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10, covering P31-P40) which captures the downward trend (avg ~75 units) while filtering the noise of the single ultra-low P40 result. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle moderate volatility around this new baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensified at Period 40: Demand dropped to 30 units, the lowest since the game began. The 10-period average (P31-P40) is now 75.2 units, down from the earlier post-summer average of 93 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT (Men's Underwear/Jersey Basic) reflects strong seasonality. We are currently in early December (Period 43). After a significant cooling period in November (P40-P41 demand avg ~34), Period 42 saw a massive spike to 150 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday and the start of the holiday shopping season. Given this is a basic cotton T-shirt, another spike for Christmas/year-end gifting is probable. On-hand inventory is 90 units with 257 in-transit (orders from P39-P42). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during the late December/early January period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the start of the holiday surge) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the holiday season. The OR backend will use these to adjust the base stock to meet this renewed demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected at Period 42 (2019-11-25): demand jumped to 150 units (+341% vs P40-P41 average of 34), signaling the end of the post-summer cooling phase and the start of holiday seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-69.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility likely linked to early holiday retail events. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 150 units (corresponding to Black Friday week), followed by a sharp drop to 46 in Period 43. This pattern is typical for basic items where demand pulled forward into major promos can be followed by a temporary lull before the pre-Christmas peak begins. Since we are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), we anticipate a sustained high demand regime for basic cotton T-shirts through the Christmas gift-giving season. The average demand over the last two periods (P42 and P43) is 98 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding cooling phase average (~34). To capture this holiday shift while managing the volatility of specific promo spikes, I will use a 3-period average (P41-P43) for mu_hat to bridge the gap between the low pre-holiday and high holiday demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (115) and pipeline (203) are relatively healthy, but we need to ensure enough stock is arriving for the final weeks of December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed starting Period 42: P42-P43 average is 98 units, a 188% increase over the P40-P41 cooling period average of 34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has shown high volatility recently: a sharp holiday spike in P42 (150 units), followed by a significant drop in P43-P44 (46 and 49 units). This pattern is consistent with early holiday shopping followed by a pre-Christmas lull or the tail end of a promotion. However, we must remain prepared for potential late-December or year-end spikes for basic T-shirts. The current on-hand inventory is 97, with 244 units in-transit (orders from P41-P44). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the recent demand surge and subsequent drop, I will use a 3-period average (P42-P44) to capture the current holiday regime (average ~81.7), which is higher than the pre-holiday cooling period (avg ~34) but accounts for the recent softening. Setting N=3 for mu_hat captures this specific holiday window. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Following a peak of 150 in P42, demand averaged 47.5 in P43-P44. The overall holiday window (P42-P44) average is 81.7 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching Christmas and New Year's. Historical demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt jumped in P42 (Nov 25) with 150 units, signaling holiday seasonality. While recent demand fluctuated (P43: 46, P44: 49, P45: 107), the average for the P42-P45 window is 88 units. However, basic apparel often sees another surge late December. I am forecasting a mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4, avg ~88) to capture this holiday volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to account for the high variance (std ~49). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 312 in-transit (P42-P45 orders), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap today.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand window (P42-P45) average established at 88 units with high volatility (range 46-150).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30th, the final week of the year. The historical demand data (P42-P46) reflects holiday seasonality for this Jersey Basic T-shirt, with demand spikes in P42 (150) and P45 (107) interspersed with lower values. The current holiday regime average is approximately 88 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P42 order arriving in P46). On-hand inventory is 71 units, with 285 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Specifically, the P43 order (17 units) and P44 order (72 units) are due to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively. We use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current holiday regime (avg ~88, high volatility). This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the expected demand during the lead time + review period, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonality (P42-P46) average demand established at 87.2 units (+156% vs P40-P41 floor) with high volatility (range 46-150). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
