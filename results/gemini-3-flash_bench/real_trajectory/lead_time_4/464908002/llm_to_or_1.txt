Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have 5 historical demand samples (83, 59, 64, 50, 36). The demand is showing a clear downward trend over the last 5 weeks. The item is 'Womens Lingerie - Thongs', which usually has stable demand but can be influenced by post-holiday lulls (February often sees a drop after January sales or pre-Valentine's spikes, though the data shows a decline leading into Feb). I will use the recent 3 samples to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~50) while the system stabilizes. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Since there are no concluded arrivals yet, I will stick to the promised lead time. The OR engine will use these parameters to set a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) based on the recent downward trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we placed an order for 74 units. According to the promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 start message. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we had a stockout in P1 (demand=32, sold=0). The product is 'Womens Underwear (Thong 3pk)', which typically has steady demand but can be influenced by basic retail cycles. Demand samples (83, 59, 64, 50, 36, 32) show a downward trend over the last 6 weeks (from ~80 down to ~30s). Using the most recent 3-4 weeks for mean/variance calculation is more appropriate than the full history to avoid over-ordering based on the high January numbers. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (~35-50 range) while maintaining the default promised lead time (L) as there are no completed lead-time observations yet to suggest a drift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's lingerie item (3-pack thongs). Historical demand samples show a downward trend from January (83, 59, 64, 50) into early February (36). The most recent concluded periods (P1: 32, P2: 40) confirm a lower demand regime compared to the January average. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from P1 and P2 are correctly still in transit (464908002: In-transit 144 = 74+70). Stockouts occurred in P1 and P2 because we started with 0 inventory and lead time is 4. I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=5: P2, P1, and the last 3 historical samples) to capture this lower post-Holiday/early-Spring demand level (averaging ~44 units/week). This balances the need for stock once arrivals begin in Period 5/6 without overstocking during a lower demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's 3-pack thong. Initial demand samples show a downward trend (83, 59, 64, 50, 36), and the observed demand in Periods 1-3 (32, 40, 42) suggests a relative stability around 35-42 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (74), P2 (70), and P3 (66) are currently in-transit (total 210 units). The P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at P6 START). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts/lost sales. Since the total pipeline (210) covers approximately 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (~40/week), and we are still within the promised lead time window for the first order, I will maintain the default lead time setting. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods (32, 40, 42) are more representative of the current 'in-game' environment than the pre-game samples. Thus, I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized demand phase, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Lingerie (3pk thongs). Historical demand samples are 83, 59, 64, 50, 36 (Avg ~58), but recent realized demand in Periods 1-4 was 32, 40, 42, 40 (Avg ~38.5), suggesting a lower regime than the seed data. Inventory is currently 0 because reached promised lead time (4) has not passed since the first order in Period 1. The order from Period 1 (74 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, 210 units are in-transit (P1: 74, P2: 70, P3: 66). Since these orders cover nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate and the pipeline is full, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend of ~39 per week. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 39 = 195. Given we have 210 in transit and 0 on hand, the OR engine (base_stock - pipeline) will likely order a very small amount or zero, which is appropriate until we confirm the first arrival and lead time stability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is Women's Underwear (Thongs 3pk). The historical demand samples (83, 59, 64, 50, 36) and the observed demand in the game (32, 40, 42, 40, 24) show a downward trend or stabilization around 35-40 units per period. The average demand over all 10 available data points is 47 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the first arrival (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 5) confirms an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, L+1 = 5 periods. With 50 units on hand and 136 in transit (orders from P2 and P3), our current pipeline is 186. At an average demand of 40-47, 5 periods of demand is ~200-235 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent behavior which is slightly lower than the initial high samples. Lead time is stable at 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's thong underwear. Current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a downward trend: early Jan samples were 50-83, while the last 6 weeks (Periods 1-6) averaged ~35. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Pipeline inventory is currently 86 (orders from P3 and P6). With an on-hand stock of 87 and an average weekly demand of ~35, the current inventory position (173 total) covers nearly 5 weeks of demand, which aligns with the (L+1) coverage required. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~35) rather than the higher initial samples. Lead time is confirmed at 4, so I will stick with the default (promised) method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: From early January average of 58.4, demand has stabilized at an average of 35.1 units/week over the last 6 periods (P1-P6). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The product is a 3-pack of women's lingerie (thongs), which shows a clear demand stabilization post-January. After initial high demand in early January (avg 58.4), the last seven periods (P1-P7) show a consistent regime with an average demand of 35.5 units (32, 40, 42, 40, 24, 33, 38). Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on concluding shipments from P1, P2, and P3. In-transit inventory (48 units) consists of orders from P6 (20) and P7 (28). On-hand inventory is 115. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) = 163. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~178 units. We are slightly under-stocked relative to this forecast, but given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target (0.95) will push for higher safety stock. I will use N=7 to capture the full stable regime since the February drop.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is 'Liza Thong Low (Malva) 3pk', which shows a stabilized demand regime. Initial January high demand (~64 avg) has transitioned to a lower, stable level; over the last 8 periods (P1-P8), the average demand is 36.6 units/week. Recent weeks (P7-P8) show a slight uptick (38, 44), but not yet a significant regime shift. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Order P4 was 0 units. We are currently observing a 1-period gap in arrivals in Period 8 (no order placed in P4), which is expected. Current on-hand is 71 units with 87 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To maintain a safety stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), I will use the mean demand from the post-January regime (P1-P8, N=8) which is 36.6. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * 36.6 = 183. sigma_hat will use the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's lingerie multi-pack (thongs). Previous carry-over insights identified a stable demand regime of ~35 units/week. However, the last four periods (P6-P9) show a consistent upward trend (33, 38, 44, 49), suggesting a new demand shift or seasonal acceleration towards spring. The current average over these 4 periods is 41 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). No orders were placed in P4/P5, explaining why 'arrived=0' was recorded in P8/P9. The next arrival (the order from P6) is expected in Period 10 resolve phase. On-hand is low (22) while pipeline is healthy (135). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current upward trend in demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock accounts for the recent growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand has increased from 35.1 to 41.0 (+17%) over the last 4 periods (P6-P9), showing a steady upward trend.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' (Women's thongs) is entering late April/early May, where demand is showing a significant upward trend. The carry-over insights and game history show demand has increased from an average of 35.1 to 41.0 (+17%) and the last three periods (P8-P10) show demand of 44, 49, and 53, indicating current weekly demand is likely around 50+. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline (In-transit: 168) includes orders from P7 (28), P8 (39), P9 (48), and P10 (53). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since current demand is significantly higher than the long-term historical mean, I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this growth (weeks P6-P10: 33, 38, 44, 49, 53, mean = 43.4). Multiplying by (1+L=5) gives 217. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Demand has risen for 5 consecutive periods (P6:33 to P10:53), with the last 3 periods averaging 48.7 units/week, significantly higher than the 35-41 range previously observed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' (thong briefs) is experiencing a sustained growth phase throughout April. Demand has risen steadily from 32-40 units in February to 60 units in the most recent period (P11). The last four historical periods (P8-P11) show demands of 44, 49, 53, and 60, averaging approximately 51.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) because recent arrivals (20, 28) were insufficient to cover the escalating demand, leading to lost sales. Current in-transit inventory (197) represents orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals. To address the stockout and the clear upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~51.5) while allowing the OR engine to scale this by (1+L) to cover the pipeline window. I will use the last 6 periods for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend confirmed: Weekly demand has risen for 6 consecutive weeks, reaching 60 units in P11. Four-week average (P8-P11) is now 51.5 units/week, a +47% increase from the March stable mean of 35.1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Lingerie/Thongs) is experiencing a sharp demand surge spanning 7 consecutive weeks (P6: 33 units to P12: 81 units). The most recent demand (81) is significantly higher than the previous 4-week average used in earlier periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of lost sales/stockouts, the current pipeline needs to be aggressively managed to catch up to this growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the rapid acceleration (44, 49, 53, 60, 81 in recent periods), mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest peak (avg ~65 units/week) rather than the long-term stable mean of 35. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflecting the current high-demand regime of (1+L)*65 = 325.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive demand acceleration confirmed: Demand increased for 7 consecutive weeks, reaching 81 units in P12 (a 130% increase from the March baseline of 35). Current 3-period average is 64.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $812.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 464908002 (Womens Lingerie) shows significant volatility. While there was a sustained upward trend from Period 6 to Period 12 (peaking at 81 units), Period 13 saw a sharp drop to 43 units. This suggests either a peak depletion or high variance around a new higher mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there is a large pipeline (268 units) following aggressive ordering in recent weeks. Given the drop in Period 13 demand, using a short-window average (recent_N=4) for mu_hat will capture the current higher activity (average of approx 59 units/week) while dampening the singular peak of 81. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this growth phase compared to the stable March baseline. L remains at the promised 4 units based on consistent arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 13: Following a 7-week growth trend to 81 units, demand dropped 47% to 43 units, indicating a move from a linear trend to a high-variance high-mean regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' (Women's Thong 3pk) is in a growth phase typical of late spring/pre-summer. After a volatile peak of 81 units in Period 12 followed by 43 units in Period 13, demand recovered to 55 units in Period 14. This confirms a new, higher demand regime compared to the early spring baseline of 35. The current 4-period mean (P11-P14) is 59.75 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory is critical: on-hand is low (3 units), but the pipeline is full (291 units), and we are receiving orders placed during the growth acceleration phase. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean (~60) and the recent variance observed in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility stabilized into a high-mean regime at Period 14: Four-week average (P11-P14) is 59.8 units (consisting of 60, 81, 43, 55), confirming a shift from the previous 35-40 range to a sustained level near 60 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (3pk thong). Demand has stabilized into a high-mean regime after a period of rapid growth; the last five periods of demand are 60, 81, 43, 55, and 52, resulting in a mean of 58.2 units/week. While there was a spike to 81, the last three weeks (43, 55, 52) suggest the mean is currently around 50-60. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 11 order in Period 15. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), but the pipeline is substantial (298 units) due to aggressive ordering during the recent trend. To avoid over-ordering as the trend flattens, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture the current high-mean, high-volatility regime (P11-P15), while sticking to the calculated lead time which reflects the stable 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~58 units/week (P11-P15 average: 58.2), shifting from the previous growth trend to a high-mean, high-variance state.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/03. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime has transitioned from a sharp growth phase to a high-mean, high-variance state. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 57.5 units/week (60, 81, 43, 55, 52, 54). Although there was one outlier (81), the recent consistency around the 50-55 range suggests the growth has plateaued. On-hand inventory is low (22), and pipeline inventory (268) is substantial, including large orders from P13 (90) and P14 (76) that are expected to arrive in the coming periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-mean regime (approx. 57.5 units) while filtering out the earlier, lower-demand periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the significant volatility observed since P11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2008.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-06-03 (P17) spiked to 106 units, nearly double the recent average of ~58 units/week. This aligns with early June, likely a seasonal peak for lingerie/underwear. Despite the high demand, sales were fully satisfied due to the arrival of 90 units (from P13). Current on-hand is low (6 units), but 223 units are in-transit. Observations from P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16, and P17 consistently confirm a lead time of 4 periods. Given the sharp demand spike in P17, I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation with N=4 to capture the current high-demand momentum (averaging ~66.5 units/week: 52, 54, 106 plus historical context) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the increased volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed at Period 17: Demand reached 106 units (+82% vs previous 5-period average of 58), suggesting June seasonality for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Liza Thong Low (Malva) 3pk' is experiencing a significant demand surge in mid-June (P17: 106, P18: 139). This confirms a seasonal peak following the previously noted 'high-mean regime' of ~60 units/week. The last 3 periods (P16-P18) average 99.7 units, and the last 2 specifically average 122.5 units. Given the date (June 17), this likely reflects mid-summer seasonality. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 253 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit forecast to capture this spike and prevent chronic backorders. I will base the weekly mean on a 'recent_N' of 3 (99.7 units) but slightly weighted towards the most recent peak (139), setting the weekly forecast at 115 units. mu_hat = (1+L) * 115 = 575. Sigma_hat is set using a small N (3) to account for the current high volatility during this trend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand seasonal peak: Period 17-18 average demand reached 122.5 units, a 110% increase over the May mean of 58 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/06/24. Observations from the last three periods (P17-P19) confirm a significant seasonal demand spike for women's lingerie (summer seasonality), with demand values of 106, 139, and 84 units (average 109.7). This is a dramatic increase from the May average of ~58 units. The system is currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods) because the pipeline inventory ordered during the lower-demand regime is insufficient for this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P17, P18, and P19). To capture this seasonal peak and minimize lost sales, mu_hat must be set using recent demand data. I am selecting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent June peak heavily (P17-P19), which will set a base stock level capable of handling the current high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak fully confirmed: average demand for P17-P19 is 109.7 units/week, a 90% increase over the May mean (58 units).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 21 (July 1), demand context shows that we are likely at the tail end or just past the peak of a significant June seasonal trend. Historical demand for P17-P20 averaged 106.8 units (106, 139, 84, 98), compared to the May average of ~58 units. The period date of July 1 suggests a potential slight cooling from the June peak, but demand remains high. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts over the last three periods (P18-P20) due to the demand surge outstripping past replenishment. Given lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. While June was very high (avg ~107), I will use an N=4 average for mu_hat to capture this recent seasonal peak, but I will monitor for a July decline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P16 order arriving in P20.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak plateaued at ~107 units/week (P17-P20 average: 106.8), representing a 1.8x increase over the May mean.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th. The June seasonal peak has been confirmed with demand averaging ~108 units/week over the last 5 periods (P17-P21: 106, 139, 84, 98, 112). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because arrivals from the lower-order Period 17 (45 units) were insufficient to meet demand (112 units). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With high demand sustained into early July, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this elevated regime (107.8 * 5 = 539). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 575 units (from P18: 106, P19: 186, P20: 156, P21: 127), which is largely sufficient to cover the expected demand of 539 over the next (L+1) periods, but the backend's capped policy will moderate any unnecessary excess ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for July: Average weekly demand remains at 107.8 units (P17-P21), confirming the June peak has extended into the first week of July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand seasonal peak corresponding to the summer season (June/July). The demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged 108.8 units (106, 139, 84, 98, 112, 114), showing a stabilization around 110 units/week. This represents a confirmed regime shift from the May average of ~58. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand exceeding current arrivals, I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this summer peak level while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility of this high-demand period. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the remainer of the summer peak (L+1 = 5 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak stabilized: Average demand for P17-P22 is 108.8 units/week, maintaining a consistent high-mean regime (+87% vs May) for 6 consecutive weeks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand summer seasonal regime. Demand for the last 7 periods (P17-P23) has averaged 108.6 units/week (106, 139, 84, 98, 112, 114, 107), confirming a significant jump from the May baseline. Analysis of the lead time indicates a consistent performance of exactly 4 periods (P19 ordered 186, arrived P23 conclude). Current on-hand is 79 with 426 units in-transit. Since we are in a stabilized high-demand regime, I will use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific summer period's mean (approx 108.6) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand level plus a safety buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1405.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464908002 (Lingerie/Thongs) is currently in a summer seasonal peak. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-mean regime that began around Period 17 (early June). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is 105.25 units/week. However, the most recent demand (P24) was 82 units, suggesting we may be moving past the absolute peak toward a slightly lower but still elevated late-summer level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory has recovered to 153 units due to large arrivals from orders placed during the peak. In-transit inventory stands at 370 units (orders from P21-P24). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels as the peak potentially tapers, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the high-demand summer window) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high average of the last two months with the recent slight softening in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high summer mean: Period 17-24 average is 105.3 units/week, with a slight tapering observed in Period 24 (82 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that this SKU (thong briefs) experienced a significant seasonal peak starting in early June (Period 17), with demand jumping from ~58 units/week to over 100 units/week. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the average demand is 104.2 units/week. However, the last two weeks (P24-P25) have shown slightly lower demand (82 and 94 units), suggesting the summer peak might be beginning to stabilize or taper. Given that we are in early August, a high but stable demand profile is expected before the end of summer. I will use a recent_N of 9 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-summer regime while tempering it slightly with the most recent observations. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 186 on-hand and 314 in transit.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak tapering: Demand for the last 2 periods (P24-P25) averaged 88 units, down from the June/July average of ~110 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August, showing a clear tapering from the summer peak (June/July avg ~107). Demand has dropped from 94 to 61 units over the last two periods, following the trend noted in the Carry-over Insights. The 4-period lead time remains stable and confirmed. Given the significant shift from the peak regime, I am using a recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend (avg of P24-P26 is ~79 units/week) while maintaining a safe buffer for volatility. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is currently 523 units, which covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate, so the OR backend will likely throttle ordering to avoid overstocking during this cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods (94 to 61) from the summer peak mean of 107. P24-P26 average is 79.0 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 is currently in a post-summer tapering phase. The high-demand peak observed from Period 17 to Period 23 (averaging ~107 units/week) has significantly subsided. Over the last four periods (P24-P27), demand has been 82, 94, 61, and 60, averaging 74.25 units/week. The most recent two periods (61 and 60) suggest that demand may be stabilizing at a level approximately 40% lower than the summer peak but still higher than the spring baseline of ~35. With lead time stable at 4 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward shift while ensuring enough safety stock to cover the L+1 period demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=4 to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility in this new regime. On-hand plus in-transit inventory (208 + 255 = 463) is currently high relative to the projected 5-period demand (74.25 * 5 = 371.25), so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to optimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-summer peak: Demand for P26-P27 has leveled at ~60 units/week, down from the June/July mean of 107 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits clear seasonal behavior. Demand peaked in June/July (P17-P23) with an average of ~108 units/week. Since P24, demand has moved into a established tapering phase. The last three periods (P26-P28) show remarkable stability with demand values of 61, 60, and 61 respectively. This indicates a new post-summer regime centered around 61 units/week. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 247 and in-transit at 155, the pipeline (402 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 6.5 periods of the current demand regime (61 * 6.5 = 396.5). Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods), we are currently well-stocked. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this post-peak stabilization accurately.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand has converged to a tight range of 60-61 units/week over the last 3 periods (P26-P28), following the July peak tapering.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September after a sustained summer peak (June-July) and a clear tapering phase in August. Demand has stabilized at approximately 60-70 units/week over the last 4 periods (P26-P29: 61, 60, 61, 71). The average demand for these 4 periods is 63.25 units. While Period 29 showed a slight uptick to 71, the overall post-peak regime remains consistent. Lead time is reliably 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (P20-P29). Currently, on-hand inventory is 247 with 84 in-transit (Total pipeline: 331). At a forecast of ~63 units/week, this covers roughly 5.2 periods, which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized post-summer mean while allowing for the slight upward variance seen in the most recent week.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization at Period 29: Demand remains steady in the 60-70 range (4-period average: 63.3), confirming the end of the summer peak tapering phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. We have completed the summer seasonal peak (June-July avg ~107) and the subsequent tapering phase. Demand has now stabilized in a post-summer regime; the last 5 periods (P26-P30) show demand of 61, 60, 61, 71, and 61, resulting in a mean of 62.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is high at 270 units, which is approximately 4.3 weeks of current demand coverage. Pipeline inventory is nearly empty (5 units in transit), which is appropriate given the current stock level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stable post-summer mean (approx 62.8 * 5 = 314) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (2019-09-16). Historical data and carry-over insights show that the summer seasonal peak (June-July, ~107 units/week) has fully tapered. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime starting around Period 26. Recent demand for the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has been 61, 60, 61, 71, 61, 43, resulting in an average of 59.8 units/week. Period 31's drop to 43 might be a low outlier or the start of a further decline toward early-year levels (~35-40). Given the high inventory on-hand (227), which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate, and an 'in-transit' of 61 units (total coverage ~4.8 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average to avoid over-ordering while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to capture recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed post-summer peak: Average weekly demand for P26-P31 is 59.8 units, a significant reduction from the 107 units/week summer average.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (P33). Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization after the summer peak (June/July ~107 units) to a much lower regime. Specifically, the last two periods (P31-P32) have shown a further decline to 43 and 38 units respectively, significantly lower than the post-summer average of 60-70 units observed in P26-P30. This suggests a secondary downward shift or the return to the early Spring baseline (approx 35-40 units). On-hand inventory is healthy at 189 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P28-P32) to capture this downward trend (averaging ~50.2 units/week). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Average weekly demand has decreased from 63 units (P26-P30) to 40.5 units (P31-P32), returning towards the early Spring baseline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' has transitioned from its high-demand summer seasonal peak (which averaged ~107 units/week in June/July) to a lower demand regime. Since Period 31, demand has stabilized at a lower mean; the last three periods (P31-P33) show demand of 43, 38, and 56, averaging 45.7 units/week. This represents a significant drop from the post-summer stabilization level of ~60 units/week observed in August. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With 133 units on-hand and 136 in-transit (orders from P30-P33), the total pipeline inventory is 269 units. Given the transition and current mean, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to quickly reflect this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking as we enter October.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 34: Demand has decreased from the post-summer mean of ~60 to an average of 45.7 units/week over the last 3 periods (P31-P33), returning toward early Spring levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong 3pk) has stabilized into a low-demand regime following the summer seasonal peak (June-August). For the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged 44.75 units (43, 38, 56, 42), which is consistent with the early spring baseline and a significant reduction from the post-peak mean of ~60 units observed in early September. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34 resolution). Current inventory levels are relatively high: On-hand is 96 units and In-transit is 131 units (orders from P31, P32, and P33 totaling 131), while expected demand over the next lead time plus review period (5 weeks) is approximately 224 units (44.75 * 5). The pipeline is sufficient, but I will transition mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=4 to reflect the current demand floor of ~45 units/week. This prevents over-ordering as the game moves into mid-October.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~45 units/week: For the 4-period window P31-P34, demand has averaged 44.75 units, returning significantly toward the early seasonal baselines after the summer peak and initial tapering.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October (P36), where demand has stabilized following the summer peak and the subsequent tapering in early autumn. Over the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 46.2 units/week (43, 38, 56, 42, 52), which aligns with the 'Spring' baseline observed earlier in the year. The inventory position is currently healthy with 100 units on-hand and 101 in-transit, totaling 201 units. This pipeline covers roughly 4.3 weeks of the current demand mean. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-summer' regime while filtering out the high volatility of the July/August period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low 3pk) has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Following the high summer peak (June/July ~107 units) and a subsequent mid-range plateau (August/September ~60 units), demand has settled around 45 units/week over the last 6 periods (P31-P36 average: 44.5 units). Current on-hand inventory is 107 units with 116 units in transit (orders from P33, P35, P36). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 captures this latest stable regime precisely. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. These parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain a buffer that accounts for the current demand level while gradually clearing excess stock from the previous higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized: Average demand for the 6-week window P31-P36 is 44.5 units/week, establishing a consistent lower baseline following the summer peak and August tapering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 has stabilized at a lower post-summer baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand has averaged 44.7 units/week (43, 38, 56, 42, 52, 36, 48), successfully reverting from the summer peak (~107) and the subsequent August tapering (~63). There are no new significant seasonal drivers identified for late October. On-hand inventory is 91 units and the pipeline is 113 units, providing comfortable coverage against current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P30 arrived in P34, P31 in P35, P32 in P36, P33 in P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong 3pk) has stabilized into a post-summer baseline. Over the last 8 periods (P31-P38), demand has averaged 44.75 units per week, with a consistent range between 36 and 56. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this specific post-peak regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in P37 of the P33 order. Current on-hand is 48, and there is a significant pipeline of 161 units (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). While the P34 order was 0, the substantial in-transit volume covers approximately 3.6 weeks of demand at the current rate. Setting L to calculate and using recent demand statistics will allow the OR backend to maintain the target stock level without over-ordering during this stable period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of thongs, which has shown significant seasonality: a summer peak (P17-P25) averaging ~105 units/week, followed by an autumn stabilization phase. Since Period 31, the demand has entered a lower-mean regime. Over the last 9 periods (P31-P39), demand has averaged 43.0 units/week (range 29-56). The most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) averaged 40.0 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P35 order arriving in P39). On-hand inventory is 45, with 175 units in-transit. Given the entry into late autumn/early winter, demand for this staple lingerie item is expected to remain stable at the lower baseline observed in early Spring. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this post-summer baseline (P31-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default lead time (4).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P31-P39) stabilized at 43.0 units/week, similar to the early Spring baseline (P1-P9 mean of 41.5).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The SKU 464908002 (3-pack thong underwear) has stabilized into a post-summer demand regime that mirrors its early Spring baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is 40.2 units/week, with the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 32.2 units/week. This downward drift suggests we should focus on the most recent demand window to avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (78) plus in-transit stock (143) totals 221 units. Based on a 5-week lead+review period and a mean demand of ~35, we need approximately 175-200 units on-hand+in-transit. The current pipeline is slightly high, so a conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) is appropriate to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P36-P40 average demand is 32.2 units/week, representing a continued slight decline from the P31-P39 mean of 43.0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level since the post-summer tapering. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand samples are [48, 43, 29, 25, 25], averaging 34.0 units/week. This aligns with the transition into late autumn/early winter for this lingerie SKU. The most recent three samples [29, 25, 25] show a further drop to 26.3 units/week. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 82 and in-transit at 135 (total 217), and demand averaging ~30, we are currently overstocked relative to the (L+1) window (which would require ~150-180 units). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 periods) to capture the lower winter demand baseline while providing enough buffer for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower winter baseline: P37-P41 average is 34.0 units/week, with the last 2 weeks (P40-P41) holding steady at 25 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Based on historical data, demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) follows a strong seasonal pattern: it was low in early Spring (~35-40), peaked significantly in June/July (110+), and has since stabilized at a lower winter baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P37-P42), demand has averaged 31.7 units/week. Specifically, the last 3 samples are 25, 25, and 38. This indicates a stable low-demand regime typical for the end-of-year period before potential holiday or clearance events. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 92 and 87 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41 scheduled to arrive in P43, P44, P45), the pipeline is well-stocked relative to current demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6, covering P37-P42) to catch the current stable lower mean (approx 31.7) and set the OR parameters to maintain stock levels without accruing excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit versus $19.0 profit).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P37-P42 is 31.7 units/week, reflecting a return to the lower baseline observed in early Spring, following the summer peak and autumn tapering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Thong Low' has significantly dropped as we enter December, with Period 43 recording a low of 10 units. This is consistent with the 'Winter demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights, where demand has stabilized at a lower baseline (averaging ~31.7 over P37-P42). Currently, on-hand inventory is 122 units and in-transit is 78 units (orders from P40, P41, and P43), totaling 200 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods and the current demand rate, this protects the stock-out risk for more than 5 periods (200 / 31.7 \u2248 6.3 periods). To prevent excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am using recent_N (N=7: P37-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current winter baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a low-demand winter regime as of December 16th. Over the last five periods (P40-P44), demand has been significantly lower than previous months, averaging 22.6 units/week (25, 25, 38, 10, 15). The most recent two weeks show even lower demand (10, 15), likely reflecting a pre-holiday lull for this specific category or a shift in purchasing patterns. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high at 133 units, and with 56 units in-transit, the current stock covers over 8 weeks of current demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect this stabilized lower baseline while the system holds enough safety stock to handle the nearing end of the game (Period 47). This avoids over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized at lower level: P40-P44 average is 22.6 units/week, down from the October/November mean of ~43 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $566.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Demand for this womens lingerie SKU has transitioned from a stable winter baseline (P40-P44 average ~22.6 units) to 36 units in Period 45. Historically, we saw a massive seasonal peak in summer (June/July ~107 units), but winter demand has been significantly lower. With only 1 period remaining in the game (P47), we must avoid over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 118 units, which is more than triple the most recent demand (36 units) and far exceeds any reasonable forecast for the final period. The OR backend uses a base stock policy that considers (L+1) periods of demand; by using a recent 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, we capture the low winter baseline while acknowledging the slight uptick in P45. This will result in a base stock level well below our current inventory, leading to a zero-order recommendation for the final stretch of the game to maximize profit and minimize holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final period of 2019 (2019/12/30). A significant demand regime shift was detected around Period 40, where demand stabilized at a lower winter baseline. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P40-P46) is 25.4 units/week, with the most recent Period 46 showing 29 units. Inventory is currently high with 89 units on-hand and 52 units in transit (expected to arrive from previous orders P43, P44, P46). Given that the profit margin is high ($19) compared to holding cost ($1), a service level of 95% is appropriate. I will use the established low-demand regime (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current winter baseline, ensuring we don't over-order as we likely enter the post-holiday January period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P40-P46) confirmed at a mean of 25.4 units/week, significantly lower than the autumn baseline of 43 units.
