Historically (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand has averaged approximately 68 units per week (min 48, max 81). Given it's a sports/fitness item, demand typically remains steady or increases slightly heading into spring as outdoor activities resume. Period 1 is 2019-02-11. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be available for demand in Periods 5 and beyond. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To avoid lost sales, I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 periods). Forecasted weekly demand is ~70 units. Total coverage needed = 70 * 5 = 350 units. Since I have 0 inventory, I will place an initial order of 350 units to establish stock and buffer against lead time.",

Demand for 5 periods @ 66 units/week = 330 units. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 350 in-transit, totaling 350. This covers the next 5 periods of expected demand. However, since the order placed in P1 won't arrive until P5, I will experience stockouts in Periods 2, 3, and 4. I should place small supplemental orders or maintain the pipeline. Since the current in-transit (350) already exceeds the 5-period requirement (330) and the holding cost is relatively high ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit), I must be careful not to overstock once the initial large order arrives.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 678691002 (High Support Sports Bra) experienced a massive demand spike during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (Period 42), reaching 123 units, which depleted all on-hand inventory. Following this, Period 43 demand returned to a 'normal' Q4 level of 22 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is an order of 220 units placed in Period 43 (in-transit). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, this 220-unit shipment is expected to arrive in Period 47 (the final period of the game). No other orders are currently in-transit. For the remaining periods (44, 45, 46, 47), demand is expected to remain in the late Q4 regime (average ~25 units) possibly with a slight pre-Christmas lift. Since the game ends at Period 47, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, placing an order now is useless as it will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the total reward. The 220 units already in transit will arrive exactly for the final period's resolution.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 678691002 is a 'Carina High Support Bra'. We are currently at Period 45 (2019/12/16). Demand has historically shown regime shifts: Q1 (~60 units/week), Q2 (~52 units/week), and Q3 (~35 units/week). In Q4, demand dropped to ~25 units/week, with a significant Black Friday spike of 123 units in P42 (Nov 25), which completely depleted inventory. Observations in P43 (22 units) and P44 (9 units) show demand cooling rapidly after the spike. A large order of 220 units was placed in P43 following the stockout, which is expected to arrive in P47 (due to the confirmed 4-period lead time). With 220 units already in transit and the game ending in Period 47, this pipeline is sufficient to cover the remaining periods at the current depressed demand rate (averaging <20 units in the last two weeks). Placing further orders would only incur holding costs on remaining stock at the game's conclusion without providing additional sales benefit, as any new order would arrive after the final period (P45 + 4 = P49).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a high-support sports bra. Demand analysis shows a significant surge in December, with Period 45 recording 211 units (Dec 16), likely driven by pre-Christmas shopping or New Year's resolution-related fitness purchases. This follows a previous spike during Black Friday (P42: 123 units). The current status is 0 on-hand inventory with 220 units in-transit (ordered in P43). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the 220 units ordered in P43 are scheduled to arrive during Period 47 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible at the start of Period 48. Given that we are currently at the start of Period 46, we are facing stockouts in P46 and P47. The primary goal is to ensure stock for the post-holiday/January 'New Year, New Me' fitness surge, which typically sees high demand for sports bras. Historical demand in Q1 (P1-P8) averaged 63 units/week. Combined with the recent Dec 16 spike, I expect robust demand in early 2020. I will place an order now (P46) which will arrive in P50 to maintain the pipeline and prevent continued stockouts after the P43 order is depleted.",

This aligns with New Year health and fitness resolutions. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed substantial demand in P45 and P46. There are 370 units in-transit: 220 units ordered in P43 (expected arrival P47 arrival resolution, visible P48) and 150 units ordered in P46 (expected arrival P50). Period 47 is the last period of the simulation based on the date (Dec 30). In Step 1, I place an order for P47. However, with a lead time of 4 periods, this order would only arrive in Period 51, which is likely beyond the simulation scope. Nevertheless, following standard policy to cover (L+1) future demand: Demand is currently very high (~200 units/week). Total pipeline needed for 5 weeks at a conservative post-peak average of 100 units/week would be 500 units. Current pipeline (including P43 and P46 orders) is 370 units. I will order 130 units to bring the total pipeline to 500, though the primary constraint is the delay in arrivals from P43.",
