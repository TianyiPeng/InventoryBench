Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 1 (2019/2/11). We are managing 'Kanta slacks RW', women's ankle-length cigarette trousers. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks ranges from 74 to 101, with a mean of 91.6 and standard deviation of approx 9.4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. There is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or demand regime changes. Given the Profit/Holding ratio of 1.0/1.0, the implied service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should aim for the median demand. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (N=5). The parameters will lead the OR backend to set a base stock covering approximately (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and 109 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. Demand in Period 1 was 106, but since no inventory was available, 0 were sold. The product is 'Ankle-length cigarette trousers', which is a standard 'Womens Everyday Collection' item. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows an average of approximately 92 units per week (74, 101, 98, 91, 94). Period 1 demand (106) is slightly higher than the previous average but consistent with the general scale. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for bridge period (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the last 5 historical samples plus Period 1 (N=6) to estimate demand. Lead time is kept as the default 4 until observed otherwise. The goal is to establish a base stock that accounts for the current 109 units in transit while protecting against stockouts during the lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is 'Kanta slacks RW', a women's clothing item. Historical weekly demand averaged ~92 units in Jan/Feb (Period -4 to 0). However, demand spiked significantly in Period 1 (106) and doubled in Period 2 (207). This sharp increase likely correlates with the transition into spring fashion cycles or a specific promotion. Demand for Period 3 is expected to remain high. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from Period 1 & 2 are still in transit and won't arrive until Period 5/6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. To mitigate this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples (mean ~156) to capture the recent surge and setting L to 'default' (4). The OR engine will factor in the 222 units already in transit. Because holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the service level target (q) will be 0.5, but the capped policy protects against excessive over-ordering while trying to meet the heightened demand.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 2 (Demand=207, vs Jan avg ~92), potentially seasonal for spring collection.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU 'Kanta slacks' is a women's everyday ankle-length trouser, which is highly seasonal for the spring collection. Demand has surged significantly starting in Period 2 (P1: 106, P2: 207, P3: 260), moving well beyond the January average of ~91. We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 sold vs high demand) because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (placed P1) is not expected until Period 5. Total in-transit is 496 units (P1: 109, P2: 113, P3: 274). Current demand regime (last 3 periods) average is ~191, but the most recent sample (P3) is 260. Given the spring seasonality, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or continue to climb. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this shift. Since no orders have arrived yet (L=4), I will use the default lead time method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Spring surge began Period 2, with demand increasing from ~92 to an average of 191 (+107%) over the last 3 weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (March 11). The product is 'Kanta slacks' for women, which is experiencing a significant demand surge likely due to the spring collection season. Historical demand has shifted from ~94 in Jan/early Feb to an average of ~240 in the last three weeks (P2-P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 816 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at P5, the order placed in P1 (ordered 109) is expected to arrive during P5's resolution phase (N+L = 1+4=5). Therefore, we should see it reflected in the next period's status. There is no evidence yet to suggest lead time drift or lost orders. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime and and recent_N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the increased variance during this surge. L remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18). The product is 'Kanta slacks RW', a women's everyday cigarette trouser. Historical demand confirms a significant regime shift starting in mid-February (Period 2), aligning with spring collection seasonality. Demand has jumped from a Jan/Early Feb average of ~92 to an average of ~250 over the last three weeks (P3: 260, P4: 254, P5: 278). Regarding lead time, Period 5 saw the arrival of the Period 1 order with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, due to the rapid demand surge and zero starting stock, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0 in P5). The current in-transit pipeline (996 units) includes orders from P2 (113), P3 (274), P4 (320), and P5 (289). We expect the P2 order (113 units) to arrive this period (P6), which will still likely result in a stockout given the current demand trend (~270+). To stabilize, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime (avg ~264) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. L remains default as the lead time of 4 is currently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels (avg ~264) from Period 3-5, confirming the seasonal spring collection surge.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Kanta slacks RW', a women's ankle-length trouser, which is highly seasonal for spring. Period 7 (March 25) is the heart of the spring shopping peak. Historical demand confirms a massive regime shift: Jan avg was ~91, but last 5 weeks (Periods 2-6) average 262.2, with the most recent week peaking at 312. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (312) significantly far outstrips the small early-season arrivals (113). Since the seasonal surge is confirmed and growing, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new elevated regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using L=default (4) as the data confirms the promised lead time holds.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak: Period 6 demand (312) confirms ongoing acceleration of the spring seasonal surge; last 5-week average is 262 (approx 3x January levels).

Daily Reward (R_t): $274.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st (Period 8). The product is 'Ankle-length cigarette trousers', which is experiencing a classic spring fashion surge. Recent weekly demand shows a massive acceleration: P5=278, P6=312, P7=423. The carry-over insights correctly identified this trend, but the intensity is exceeding previous estimates. On-hand is zero because demand (423) significantly outstripped arrivals (274) in Period 7. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). I have 1037 units in the pipeline (ordered P4-P7). My strategy is to set a high base stock to capture this peak. Since demand is currently accelerating, using the last 3 samples (avg ~338) plus a buffer is safer than long-term averages. I'll use recent_N with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture this recent high-volatility, high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in March, peaking at 423 in P7 (Period 7), which is a 52% increase over the previous three-week average. Current regime (P5-P7) avg: 338.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Kanta slacks RW' is in a massive seasonal surge associated with the spring/Easter shopping period (early April). Demand has exploded from ~92 in January to 609 in the most recent period (P8). On-hand inventory remains 0 because arrivals (based on orders from 4 weeks ago when demand was lower) are consistently being cleared immediately by current high demand. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Pipeline inventory (1180 units) represents orders from P5 (289), P6 (285), P7 (143), and P8 (463). The expected arrival for P9 is the P5 order (289 units), which is still far below the latest demand of 609. To prevent continued stockouts, mu_hat must capture this exponential trajectory. I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat based on the most recent demand (609) projected over the lead time + review period (1+4=5), setting it to 3045. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed as super-linear: P8 demand (609) is a 44% increase over P7 (423), and more than double the average from just three weeks ago. Stockout cycle persisting due to lead-time lag in order volume adjustment.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Kanta slacks RW' (Women's Everyday Collection), which is experiencing a significant seasonal surge as we progress through spring (April 15). Demand has been extremely high, though Period 9 saw a slight dip to 442 from Period 8's 609. Despite this dip, the current regime (P7-P9) average is 491 units\u2014substantially higher than early March. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We are currently in a persistent stockout state (on-hand is 0) because arrivals are based on much lower order volumes from 4 weeks ago. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (approximately 491 units per period). Because the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, this will forecast demand for the 5-period window (P10 to arrival of P10 order). I will use a high sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to maintain a high service level given the volatility and the 1:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio, which normally justifies a 50% service level but warrants buffer in a trending growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels in April; P7-P9 average is 491, compared to P4-P6 average of 281 (+75% growth). Significant stockout cycle continues due to 4-period lead time lag.

The product is 'Kanta slacks RW', a women's ankle-length trouser from the Everyday Collection. We are currently in late April (2019/04/22), which is the height of the spring retail season. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 7, moving from an average of ~260 to peaks over 600. The last four periods (P7-P10) show demand values of 423, 609, 442, and 422. This suggests a stabilized high-demand regime averaging approximately 474 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (all observed shipments P1-P6 arrived exactly in 4 periods). Since we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and demand remains more than double January levels, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) to capture this new high-demand plateau for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 weeks) at the current velocity.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for late spring (April): average demand has stabilized at ~474 units (P7-P10), up from ~260 in March. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Kanta slacks RW' is in a high-demand spring plateau in late April. Demand has stabilized around an average of 480 units over the last 5 periods (P7-P11: 423, 609, 442, 422, 535), significantly higher than earlier months. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on order arrivals from P1-P7. Currently, the system is in a deep stockout cycle due to the 4-period lead-time lag; however, substantial replenishment (2227 units in-transit) is set to start arriving from P12 onwards (P8's order of 463 is expected now). To maintain service levels for this high-demand period while accounting for the inventory catch-up, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current plateau average (~486 units per period), resulting in a base stock requirement for (L+1) = 5 periods. This ensures we order enough to sustain the current peak once the pipeline backlog clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for April/May peak: 5-week average (P7-P11) is 486 units, up from ~260 in March. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Kanta slacks' is in its peak demand phase (Late Spring/Early May). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) shows a stable, high-demand plateau with an average of approximately 510 units (P8: 609, P9: 442, P10: 422, P11: 535, P12: 544). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all concluded shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1968 units in-transit. The OR engine needs to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Since demand has plateaued at this higher level, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this specific regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility at higher demand levels. Setting L to calculate confirms the 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for peak spring season (May) confirmed at avg ~510 units/week (P8-P12). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573716012' (Kanta slacks) is in its peak spring season (mid-May). Demand has stabilized at a high plateau; the average demand for the last five periods (P9-P13) is 471.6 units per week. Period 13 demand (415) was slightly lower than the recent peak, but still significantly above the March baseline, suggesting the plateau is holding. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in every shipping conclusion since Period 5. With a current on-hand inventory of 434 and a large in-transit pipeline of 1703 units (from orders placed in P10-P13), we are finally emerging from a prolonged stockout cycle. Using recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 (demand) captures the current stabilized spring plateau (~2358 units over L+1 periods) while recent_N=5 for \u03c3\u0302 reflects the volatility observed during this peak. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period historical average.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks' (Womens Everyday Collection) has transitioned from a sharp spring surge to a stable high-demand plateau. Over the last 5 weeks (P10-P14), demand has averaged approximately 459 units, showing much lower volatility compared to the earlier growth phase. Lead times are consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P14, where the P10 order arrived). We currently have 616 units on-hand and 1264 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 1880). With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. A base stock of approximately 2300 units (5 * 460) is recommended. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this stable high-level demand while ignoring the earlier hyper-growth spikes, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility of this plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for peak spring/early summer season (May) confirmed at avg ~460 units/week (P10-P14), showing lower volatility than the initial March/April surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer demand for the 'Kanta slacks RW' has transitioned from a high-growth spring surge to a stable early summer plateau. The demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 468 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 50.7, indicating significantly reduced volatility compared to the initial March/April acceleration. The lead time remains highly consistent at exactly 4 periods. Current inventory levels are finally sufficient to meet full demand (on-hand 399 + pipeline arrivals), following a long period of stockouts. I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P11-P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current plateau mean and lower volatility, ensuring the base stock level (managed by the OR backend) aligns with this stabilized demand profile while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Kanta slacks RW' (a spring/summer everyday collection item) shows a slight downward trend as we enter June (Period 17), with demand dropping from a peak of ~540 to 382 in the latest period. The average demand over the last four periods (P13-P16) is 436.75 units. I am moving to a more responsive forecast by using a shorter window (N=4) to account for this potential post-peak softening in the summer transition. Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals (P1-P12 orders all arrived at L=4). Pipeline inventory is high (1841 units), ensuring that we are well-covered for the lead-time window plus current period demand (L+1 = 5 periods). A 4-week mean of 436.75 implies a mu_hat (L+1 demand) of approximately 2184, which is largely covered by the current on-hand (221) and in-transit (1841) totals of 2062. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the backend stabilize orders as the demand regime potentially cools from the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in late May/early June: 3-period average dropped from ~450+ to 382 in P16, suggesting post-peak spring collection stabilization.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Kanta slacks' (Womens Everyday Collection) has clearly passed its spring peak (which averaged ~510 in late April/early May) and is now entering a summer stabilization/softening phase. The demand for the last three periods (P15-P17) was 472, 382, and 358 respectively, showing a clear downward trend. The average of the most recent 3 periods is ~404, which is a significant drop from the ~460-510 levels seen in May. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods since the start of the simulation. With 447 units on hand and 1379 in-transit, the pipeline is quite full relative to the current softening demand. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this downward trend quickly and avoid overstocking as the peak season ends. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current (lower) volatility in this regime. L remains at the promised/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed: Late May/early June demand (P16-P17) dropped to an average of 370, down 20%+ from May peak (avg ~470). Entering post-peak summer stabilization phase.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Kanta slacks' (Womens Everyday Collection) is currently in a softening phase following the spring peak. Demand has decreased from a May average of ~460 units to a 3-week average (P16-P18) of 354 units, representing a ~23% drop. Lead time remains stable and consistent at 4 periods across all 14 concluded order cycles. With current on-hand inventory at 346 and in-transit at 1352 (total 1698), and a 3-week average demand of 354, the inventory position covers roughly 4.8 periods of demand. Given the current softening trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower demand mean (~354) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to adjust order volumes downward to prevent excess holding costs as we move further into the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend solidified: 3-period average (P16-P18) is 354 units, a 23% decline from the May peak of ~460.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Kanta slacks RW' (Women's Trousers) has shifted from its peak April/May demand (~480 units) to a significantly lower summer baseline. The current trend (P16-P19) shows demand levels of 382, 358, 322, and 305, clearly indicating a sustained decline as the peak spring season ends. The 4-period moving average is now approximately 342. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (order placed in P15 arrived in P19). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trajectory while maintaining enough safety stock for the lead time + review period (5 periods total). sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect recent volatility. With On-hand inventory at 555 and In-transit at 910 (total 1465), we are well-covered relative to our lead-time demand (~1710 for 5 weeks), but the OR engine will throttle new orders to prevent accumulating excess stock during this downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression confirmed (Summer phase): Demand has declined for 4 consecutive weeks (P16-P19), with the average dropping from ~460 to ~342 (-25%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Historical data confirms that the 'Kanta slacks' experienced a strong seasonal spring surge that peaked in April/May (avg ~500) and has been in a sustained decline throughout June. The last four periods (P17-P20) show demand of 358, 322, 305, and 214. This confirms the product is shifting into a lower summer demand regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is ~280, but the most recent observation of 214 suggests further softening. To avoid overstocking while holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the entirety of the June decline (Average ~300). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 16 observed arrivals, so I will continue using the 'default' promised lead time. This conservative forecast (mu_hat for 5 periods) reflects the current downward trend while preventing excessive inventory accumulation as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression into Summer phase (July): Demand has declined for 5 consecutive weeks (P16-P20), with the 3-week average falling to 280 units (a 40% decline from the May peak of ~460).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a clear seasonal decline following its spring peak. Demand has decreased for six consecutive weeks, with the most recent demand (Period 21) falling to 175 units. The average demand over the last three weeks (P19-P21) is 231 units, and the 5-week average (P17-P21) is 275 units. Given the transition into mid-summer (July), a further softening or stabilization at these lower levels is expected. We have 810 units on-hand and 514 units in-transit (total 1,324), which is more than sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 total periods) at the current demand rate of ~231. To prevent excess inventory and high holding costs during this regression phase, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-week window (N=4) to capture the accelerating decline, and setting L to calculate based on the very consistent 4-period lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression into Summer phase (July) continues: Demand has declined for 6 consecutive weeks (P16-P21), with the most recent 3-week average (P19-P21) dropping to 231 units, a 50% decline from the May peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Collection Ankle-length cigarette trousers) has entered a clear summer decline phase after peaking in May. Demand has decreased consecutively for 7 weeks (P16-P22). The most recent demand (P22) was 139 units, continuing the downward trend. Given the current date (2019/07/15), we are in the peak summer period where interest in 'stretch weave ankle-length' autumn/spring-style slacks typically hits a seasonal low before potential late-summer/pre-autumn recovery. Currently, on-hand inventory (865) and in-transit units (320) totaling 1185 are significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), assuming the 3-period average of ~176. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since my current inventory covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current decelerating rate, and profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), I must avoid accumulating excess inventory which would incur high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to catch the lower demand regime and use the default L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression into Summer phase (July) continues: 7 consecutive weeks of decline (P16-P22), with Period 22 demand dropping to 139 (-37% from the P19-P21 average). High inventory surplus developing.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573716012' is in a clear end-of-season decline phase as of late July. Demand has decreased for 8 consecutive periods (P16-P23), dropping from a May peak of ~500 to just 116 in P23. The current 3-period average (P21-P23) is 143 units, while the most recent demand is only 116. On-hand inventory is very high (821 units) compared to this declining demand, and we have another 248 units in-transit (P20 and P21 orders). Total pipeline plus on-hand (1069) covers over 7 weeks of current demand, which is excessive given the downward trend. To stop the accumulation of holding costs, I am setting parameters to prevent further ordering. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current (lower) demand regime, which will result in a base stock level significantly below our current inventory, triggering zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression into Summer/Late Summer phase confirms a sustained collapse: 8 consecutive weeks of decline (P16-P23), with Period 23 demand (116) representing a 75% drop from the May peak (~460).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573716012 continues its steep decline from the spring peak, now entering late July. Demand has fallen for 9 consecutive weeks, with Period 24 demand reaching 90 units, returning back to the initial January levels. Current on-hand inventory is 975 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~10 weeks of coverage at present levels). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to stop all new ordering to allow the system to bleed off the excess inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P21-P24) to reflect the significantly lower demand regime (average ~130 units), which will naturally result in zero orders until inventory levels drop significantly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression into late summer phase: 9 consecutive weeks of decline (P16-P24). Period 24 demand (90 units) has returned to the baseline levels observed in January. Average demand for the last 3 weeks is 115 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573716012' (women's stretch trousers) has completed its seasonal cycle. Demand peaked in May (avg ~510) and has since collapsed over a 10-week period to baseline January levels (~80-90 units). Period 25 demand was 81 units. On-hand inventory is currently 898 units, which covers approximately 10-11 weeks of current demand. With a lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory surplus, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand floor (P22-P25 average ~81), and keeping L at default (4) as arrivals are consistent. The backend will naturally zero out orders because on-hand inventory far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor reached in late July: Demand has returned to Jan/Feb baseline of ~80-100 units (Last 3 weeks avg: 82 units). Significant inventory overshoot (898 units) will prevent new orders for multiple periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-746.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks' has returned to its initial baseline after the spring/early summer seasonal peak. Current demand (Period 26: 76 units) reflects the late summer floor, which matches the January/February levels. We have an extreme inventory surplus of 822 units on-hand with no further incoming shipments. Given that the mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~82 units and we hold over 10 times that amount in stock, the priority is to avoid ordering and minimize further holding costs while waiting for this inventory to deplete. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this floor regime (approx. 90 units/week) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The backend will naturally generate zero-unit orders because the on-hand inventory (822) far exceeds the calculated base stock for the 4+1 period lead time window (approx. 450-500 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573716012' (Women's ankle-length cigarette trousers) has completed its seasonal cycle, transitioning from a heavy spring surge (peaking in May at ~510 units/week) to a summer baseline. Currently, in late August (Period 28), demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 80 units/week, mirroring January levels. The 3-week average demand (P25-P27) is 80.6 units with very low volatility. On-hand inventory is significantly high at 737 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 9 weeks of supply. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, minimizing excess inventory is critical to avoid erosion of total reward. We should stick to the 'recent_N' method (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand floor and prevent the OR engine from reacting to the high historical spring averages. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No new orders are to be expected as on-hand inventory far exceeds the required base stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks RW' has stabilized at its baseline level of approximately 80 units per week following the spring/summer peak. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is 81.5 units, confirming a return to the early-year regime. Current on-hand inventory is 653 units, which is significantly higher than the required base stock for the current demand level given a 4-period lead time. With a total pipeline + on-hand inventory already covering over 8 weeks of baseline demand, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized baseline and using the default lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: Post-summer demand has stabilized at Jan/Feb levels (~80 units/week) for 4 consecutive periods (P25-28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks' has settled into a low-volume stability phase typical of the late summer/post-peak season. For the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged approximately 77 units (81, 76, 85, 84, 57). Current on-hand inventory is 596 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for this demand level (approx. 5 periods of demand ~385 units). Consequently, no new orders have been placed since Period 21. Given the persistent stability at this floor level, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this 'new normal' and maintain sigma_hat based on the same stable window to avoid carrying excessive safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-summer demand floor, with demand stabilizing at a low baseline (average of ~65 units over the last three weeks, P28-P30). Significant excess inventory remains (537 units on-hand), which is sufficient to cover over 8 weeks of current demand levels. Given the 4-period lead time, no new orders are required. The OR backend will naturally calculate a zero order because the base_stock (calculated from the current low demand regime) will be significantly lower than the existing on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the most recent stabilized floor and ensure the parameters reflect the current low-season reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: Late summer/early autumn demand (September) has stabilized at a lower level (~65 units/week) compared to the January baseline (~80 units/week).

Since the total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the base stock requirements for lead time L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand), no new orders are necessary. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=7) to reflect this stabilized post-peak regime and avoid over-ordering while the inventory naturally depletes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable post-summer demand floor, with demand consistently ranging between 57 and 85 units over the last 8 weeks (P25-P32). The average demand for the most recent 3 weeks (P30-P32) is approximately 64 units, which is slightly lower than the January baseline of ~80. On-hand inventory is 403 units, which at the current burn rate covers approximately 6 periods of demand. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the required base stock levels. No new orders have been placed since Period 21. For Period 33, I will maintain the mu_hat based on the recent N=8 periods to reflect the stabilized autumn demand, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4. High on-hand inventory still dictates zero ordering, which the OR backend will correctly execute given the base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-151.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last period (P33) spiked to 126 units, which is a significant increase from the previous 4-week average of ~63 units. This suggests the start of a new demand regime, potentially related to an Autumn collection or a promotional event as we move into October. On-hand inventory is currently at 277 units with zero in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 34 and the subsequent 4-period arrival window (Total 5 periods). A simple 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat would be slow to react to this spike, while 'default' would be skewed by the heavy spring/summer peak. We will use an explicit forecast to account for this potential trend reversal. Assuming a new baseline around 120-130 units, the mu_hat for the (L+1) window should be approximately 650 units (5 * 130). Sigma_hat is set to a higher value to account for the increased volatility seen during transition phases. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand trend reversal detected at Period 33: demand spiked to 126 units after 4 weeks of stabilization at ~63 units, likely signaling the start of an autumn seasonal shift.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks' is exhibiting volatility as we transition into the autumn season. While Period 33 showed a spike to 126 units (hinting at a seasonal reversal), Period 34 saw a sharp drop to 39 units. The 3-period average (P32-P34) is approximately 76 units, which is consistent with the late-summer baseline. Given the product's description (stretch weave trousers) and the current date (early October), we expect moderate demand for the autumn professional/everyday collection. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Inventory is currently well-balanced: on-hand (238) plus in-transit (241) totals 479 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the recent average of ~80 units/week. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the autumnal stabilization while smoothing out the volatility of the P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal transition: Demand in late Sept/early Oct is showing high volatility (39 to 126 units) but averaging ~75 units, consistent with the pre-spring baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks RW' (Women's Everyday Trousers) has retreated significantly from its mid-year spring peak and is currently fluctuating at a lower baseline. Following a brief autumn spike in Period 33 (126 units), demand has dropped to 39 and 35 units in the last two weeks, respectively. This suggests the autumn transition is weaker or more volatile than the spring surge. Current on-hand inventory (203) plus the large in-transit shipment (241 ordered in P34) totaling 444 units is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate (~35-60 units/week). My objective is to prevent further inventory growth while maintaining a buffer. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P33-P35 avg = 67) to capture both the spike and the subsequent drop, ensuring the system doesn't over-order as the P34 shipment approaches. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in Oct: periodic spikes (P33: 126) followed by low baseline (P34-35 avg: 37). Overall autumn trend is significantly lower than spring peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks RW' is currently in a post-summer low-demand phase (Sept/Oct), with recent demand (P34-P36) averaging ~40 units/week. While P33 saw a spike to 126, it has not been sustained. On-hand inventory is 156, and an order of 241 units placed in P34 is scheduled to arrive in P38 (Lead Time = 4). Total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 397 units, which covers approximately 10 weeks of current average demand (~40 units). Given the high inventory levels relative to recent demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current lower demand level while acknowledging the P33 volatility, and maintain default lead time settings as deliveries have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed for Oct/Autumn: Following the P33 spike (126), demand has returned to a low baseline (P34-P36 average: 40 units), roughly 50% of the Jan/Feb baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October, where demand has stabilized at a low baseline (P34-P37 average: 48 units) following a brief volatility spike in September. The on-hand inventory (86) plus in-transit stock (241 from P34) totaling 327 units is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime across the 4-period lead time. The in-transit shipment ordered in P34 is expected to arrive in P39 (Period 34 + 4 + 1 for visibility), which matches the promised lead time. Given the high holding cost equal to profit and the current inventory surplus relative to the ~50 units/week demand, I will maintain parameters that prevent further ordering until the current stock is absorbed. I am using recent_N (N=4) for demand and variance to capture the most recent stabilized autumn floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-211.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low late-autumn baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 49.8 units (39, 35, 47, 70, 58), significantly lower than the Jan/Feb baseline of ~90 units and the spring peak of ~460 units. The Period 33 spike (126) appears to have been an outlier or a very brief seasonal flicker rather than a sustained trend. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the P34 order arriving in P38). On-hand inventory is currently 269 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time L=4, the pipeline coverage needs to account for 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~50 units/period, 250 units are sufficient. The backend OR logic for base stock (targeting profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5) will naturally aim to minimize inventory when profit equals holding cost. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this current low-demand regime, ensuring the system does not over-order based on historical spring/summer highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Late Autumn): Demand has stabilized at a low baseline of ~50 units/period (P34-P38 average), which is lower than the January baseline of ~80-100 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) has been 35, 47, 70, 58, 61, resulting in an average of 54.2 units. This confirms the 'Late Autumn' regime identified in the carry-over insights, where demand has stabilized at roughly 50-60 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 208 units with no units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, the total system inventory (on-hand + in-transit) must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~55 units per period, the required base stock is approximately 275 units. However, because the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning it aims for the median demand. With 208 units on hand and a demand rate of ~55, we have roughly 3.8 periods of supply. While slightly below the 5-period target, the specific OR logic (base stock = mu + z*sigma, where z=0 for q=0.5) will likely not trigger a large order yet. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P35-P39) to capture this stable late-autumn baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573716012' (women's slacks) has transitioned from a high-demand spring/summer peak into a stable low-demand autumn/winter baseline. Since Period 34, demand has fluctuated slightly but stabilized around an average of 52 units/period (P37-P40 demand: 70, 58, 61, 52). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 156 units, with 63 units in-transit (ordered P40), totaling 219 units of pipeline inventory. Given the stable demand regime and high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 each), a base stock model using the most recent stable N=7 periods (P34-P40) is appropriate to avoid inventory build-up while maintaining service for the winter baseline. Target inventory (1+L) * avg_demand \u2248 5 * 52 = 260. With 219 pipeline units already present, new orders will be minimal or zero until inventory depletes further.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a winter baseline of ~55 units/week in November (P38-P40 average: 57).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kanta slacks' has stabilized into a winter baseline. As of Period 42 (late November), the demand over the last four periods (P38-P41) has been 58, 61, 52, and 41 units, averaging 53 units/week. This confirms the winter regime identified in previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P38. My inventory position is currently 115 on-hand + 103 in-transit = 218 total. Given the low demand and 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend will target a base stock roughly equal to 5 units of lead-time demand (L+1=5). With \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 53, the base stock target is ~265. Since pipeline inventory (218) is below this, orders will likely be triggered. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stability of the current Nov/Dec winter baseline for both mean and variance.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A localized demand spike occurred in Period 42 (Demand=431), which corresponds to the Black Friday / Cyber Monday retail window (late November). This significantly depleted on-hand inventory to zero. However, given the product (Womens Everyday slacks/trousers) and historical evidence from early 2019, this is likely a temporary promotional peak rather than a regime shift. In Jan-Feb 2019, demand was ~80-100 units. The current winter baseline (P38-P41) was ~57 units. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend while partially accounting for the spike, but I will cap the volatility estimate (sigma_hat) using explicit to prevent excessive over-ordering for what is likely a one-off event. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Pipeline inventory is 150 units (orders from P40, P41, P42). Setting parameters to ensure replenishment starts now that on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (431 units); treated as a transient seasonal event rather than a sustained regime shift.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout situation following a massive demand spike during Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday, 431 units) and Period 43 (250 units). On-hand inventory is 0. 389 units are in-transit, ordered in Periods 40 (63), 41 (40), 42 (47), and 43 (239). The Period 40 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 44 (Lead time = 4). Demand has moved past the Black Friday peak but remain elevated compared to the early November baseline (approx 55 units). Given we are approaching the holiday season (mid-December), I expect demand to stabilize at a level higher than the October baseline but lower than the Black Friday pulse. I will use the most recent 3 periods (P41-P43) excluding the massive P42 outlier to forecast current demand, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this transitional period. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging P41, P42, P43) technically includes the spike, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43: 250 units) remains significantly higher than the November baseline (~55 units), indicating a potential December holiday elevation.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45), heading into the peak Christmas/New Year sales period. Demand analysis shows a significant holiday elevation: after the Black Friday spike (P42: 431) and cyber week (P43: 250), P44 demand dropped to 34, which likely reflects a stockout at the start of the period (starting on-hand was only 63, demand realized might be capped by visibility or reflects a post-peak lull before Christmas). However, looking at the product (Women's Everyday Trousers) and the calendar, we expect a second holiday surge in late December. Total pipeline inventory is 888 units, with significant arrivals expected from orders placed in P41 (40 units), P42 (47 units), P43 (239 units), and P44 (562 units). Given lead time is 4 periods, these will arrive in P45, P46, P47, and P48 respectively. My base stock needs to cover the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (total 47 periods). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the high-velocity holiday average (~187 units/period across P41-P44) while L remains at the promised 4 periods to ensure the OR engine recognizes the pipeline coverage. sigma_hat is set explicitly higher than the baseline to account for the volatility seen during the holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: December holiday elevation confirmed: Average demand shifted from ~55 units (Nov) to ~187 units (Dec, P41-P44), representing a 3.4x increase due to Black Friday and holiday shopping.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Dec 23). Period 42 saw a massive spike (431 units) for Black Friday, followed by 250 in P43 and 239 in P45. The demand in P44 dipped (34), likely due to a temporary stockout effect or post-peak lull, but the lead-up to Christmas remains strong. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 876 units in-transit. The orders placed in P42 (47 units) and P43 (239 units) are expected to arrive in P46 and P47 respectively based on a 4-period lead time. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the Dec elevation regime (P42-P45) while normalizing for the stockout in P45 where we only sold 69 against 239 demand. Demand average for P42-P45 is approx 238 units. Thus, mu_hat = (4+1) * 238 = 1190. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture holiday volatility. This aggressive mu_hat ensures that despite currently being out of stock, the pipeline of 876 units is supplemented if needed to reach the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak demand (P42-P45) is averaging ~235-250 units/week, a 4x increase over the November baseline, driven by Black Friday and Christmas shopping.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573716012 is entering Period 47 (late December/early January context). Historical evidence shows a massive holiday demand spike in December (P42-P46 averaging ~214 units/week), peaking at 431 units during Black Friday (P42). However, demand is now likely to transition from the holiday peak back toward the January baseline observed in early 2019 (Jan avg ~92). The 'In-transit' pipeline is currently very high (1143 units), primarily due to large orders placed during the December stockout periods (P43-46). Specifically, the order of 239 units (P43) is expected to arrive in Period 47 resolve phase. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the elevated holiday demand while acknowledging that the pipeline already significantly exceeds the expected demand for the next L+1 periods (Approx 200 * 5 = 1000 units). The OR backend will likely zero out new orders this period due to the high pipeline inventory. No method changes are needed given lead-time stability.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak completed: Average demand (P42-P46) was ~214 units, peaking at 431 units. Expected transition to January baseline (~90-100 units) beginning P47.
