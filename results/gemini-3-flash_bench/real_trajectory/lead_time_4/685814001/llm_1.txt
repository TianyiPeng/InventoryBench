It is a staple item, but typically sees higher demand in cooler weather. b) Seasonality/Calendar: Current date is 2019/02/11. We are in the tail end of winter/early spring. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a significant upward trend (61 -> 41 -> 106 -> 145 -> 133), suggesting a transition or a specific seasonal shift. c) Demand Forecast: The average demand over the last 5 weeks is 97.2, with a recent acceleration toward 130-145 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1 through Period 5 inclusive (5 periods total). d) Lead Time/Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am starting from zero for a product that currently demands ~130-140 units per week. e) Inventory Strategy: Target stock level should be (L+1) * Forecasted Demand + Safety Stock. With L=4, Forecast \u2248 135, and some safety stock to account for the increasing trend, I'll target 135 * 6 = 810 units. However, since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each), I must be careful not to over-order. I will place an initial order of 700 units to establish the pipeline without excessive risk of overstocking if demand plateaued at the 130-140 range.",

To maintain a pipeline covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at ~103 units/period, I need a target inventory position of roughly 515-600 units (plus safety stock). Since I already have 700 units in transit, my current pipeline (0 on-hand + 700 in-transit) is sufficient to cover the next several periods once arrivals begin. Ordering more now would only increase holding costs when the initial large shipment arrives, especially since the holding cost is high ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0). I will wait for the first shipment to arrive or for more demand data to justify a higher stock level.",

As we move into late May (Period 15, May 20), demand for heavy hoodies in the northern hemisphere typically drops significantly due to warmer weather. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 8-14) has averaged roughly 50 units per period (46, 26, 15, 90, 90, 49, 36), showing some volatility but a general downward pressure compared to Q1. On-hand inventory is currently 624 units. With no in-transit orders and a lead time of 4 periods, my current stock covers approximately 12 periods of demand at the recent average consumption rate. Holding costs are $1/unit while profit is also $1/unit, making excess inventory extremely expensive. Given the seasonal transition into summer, it is highly likely that demand will remain low or decrease further. There is no risk of stockout in the next 5 periods, and my primary objective is to liquidate the current high inventory to minimize holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'RICHIE HOOD', a cotton-blend hoodie, which exhibits strong seasonal demand. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), post-Black Friday. Historical data shows a massive spike in Period 42 (690 units) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a return to a winter baseline of 156 units in Period 43. Late December and early January typically maintain higher demand than the early autumn baseline due to colder weather and holiday gifting. The average demand post-peak (P39-P41) was ~192 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 81. In-transit inventory consists of 200 units (ordered P42, expected P46) and 400 units (ordered P43, expected P47). There is a gap in arrivals for P44 and P45 because no orders were placed in P40 and P41. Demand for P44-P47 (the arrival window for an order placed now) is estimated at ~200 units/period. Total pipeline requirement for P44-P48 (5 periods) is approximately 1,000 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 81 + In-transit 600) is 681 units. To cover the remaining demand through P48 and prevent stockouts during the late-December window, an order of 350 units is necessary.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Winter demand baseline (post-Black Friday) is approximately 160-200 units/period, roughly 15-20% higher than the pre-peak late autumn average of 170 units.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The recent demand of 249 in P44 and the Black Friday spike in P42 indicate a high-demand winter regime for hoodies, exacerbated by holiday shopping. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to a stockout in P44. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline consists of: P42 order (200 units) arriving in P46, P43 order (400 units) arriving in P47, and P44 order (350 units) arriving in P48 (not reachable within game limits). In the immediate Period 45, no arrivals are scheduled, meaning another stockout is unavoidable. For periods P45-P47 (the remaining actionable horizon), total expected demand is approx 600-750 units (based on a mean of ~200-250 per period). Current in-transit for P46-P47 is 600 units. To minimize the risk of inventory shortages in the final periods while acknowledging that any order placed now (P45) won't arrive until P49 (past the game end in P47), no units should be ordered to avoid unnecessary holding costs on the final balance sheet.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Final season demand regime (P43-P44) averages ~202 units/period, excluding the P42 Black Friday outlier. Inventory pipeline for P45-P47 is capped at 600 units (expected arrivals in P46 and P47).",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is in its peak winter demand season. Period 45 demand was 257 units, confirming a winter baseline of ~200-260 units (excluding the Black Friday spike). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 44-45. Total in-transit inventory is 950 units: 200 units (ordered P42, expected P46), 400 units (ordered P43, expected P47), and 350 units (ordered P44, expected P48). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the game concludes shortly (this is period 46/47, though the timeline typically follows a full year or specific run), and we have 950 units arriving over the next three periods against an expected demand of ~250 units/period, the pipeline is sufficient to recover from the stockout. Period 46 is Dec 23rd; demand usually tapers off significantly after the Christmas/New Year week (as seen in early 2019 data: Jan demand was ~40-100). Therefore, I will not place additional orders to avoid high holding costs and excess inventory as the season ends.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Winter peak demand confirmed (P44-P45): demand stabilized at ~250 units/period, consistent with pre-Christmas seasonal highs. Historical data from Period 1 (Feb) suggests demand will drop sharply once the mid-winter clearance/spring transition begins.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019. Historically, demand for this hoodie (a seasonal winter item) follows a clear pattern: a sharp peak in September/October (Autumn), a massive outlier for Black Friday (late Nov), a sustained high winter regime through December (approx. 200-250 units), and a forecasted sharp drop-off in February based on the very first periods of history. We are currently at Period 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 (late January/early February), exactly when seasonal demand for heavy hoodies typically collapses as retailers transition to spring inventory. Currently, we have 42 units on-hand and 750 units in-transit (400 ordered in P43, 350 ordered in P44). Based on the 4-period lead time, 400 units will arrive in P47 (visible P48) and 350 will arrive in P48 (visible P49). This total pipeline of 750 + 42 = 792 units is sufficient to cover the next 3-4 weeks of winter demand (approx. 200-250 units/period) without risking significant overstock as we enter the low-demand spring season. Minimal or zero ordering is required to maximize profit and minimize holding costs for the end-of-season transition.",
