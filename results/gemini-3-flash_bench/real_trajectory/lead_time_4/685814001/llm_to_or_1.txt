Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a Men's Hoodie. Looking at the five pre-game demand samples (61, 41, 106, 145, 133), there is a clear upward trend in demand as we move into February. The average demand across these five weeks is approximately 97.2 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given this is the first period, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0. Historically, February/March can see sustained demand for basic hoodies like this (Jersey Basic). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the recent growth while maintaining the default L=4. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic jersey hoodie. Historical demand (5 samples provided: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133) and Period 1 demand (91) show a mean of approximately 96 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (91 units). A shipment of 172 units was ordered in Period 1 and is in-transit (promised lead time is 4). Since current on-hand is 0 and we have a 4-week lead time, we need to maintain a robust pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (including Period 1) to capture the current demand level, which appears to have stepped up from the early Jan lows. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat uses all available data to ensure we cover volatility during this stock-out phase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a Men's Hoodie. Looking at the demand history provided: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133 (pre-game) and 91, 151 (Periods 1-2), the demand has trended upward significantly compared to the early January figures, likely due to late winter seasonality or product launch momentum. On-hand inventory is 0, and all demand in Periods 1 and 2 was lost (242 units). We have 172 units ordered in P1 and 163 units in P2 (Total 335 in-transit). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the timing rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 START decision. Because we are out of stock and demand is higher than the early January average (approx 104 vs 51), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on the last 5 samples (145, 133, 91, 151, and assuming a similar level for the current period) to better capture the current regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the stockout recovery.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is a Men's Hoodie. Promised lead time is 4 periods. My game history shows orders placed in Period 1 (172 units), Period 2 (163 units), and Period 3 (168 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand occurred (P1: 91, P2: 151, P3: 79). History demand samples (61, 41, 106, 145, 133) plus game history demand (91, 151, 79) show a mean demand of approximately 100 units per week. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~500 units). Total in-transit is 503, which aligns with this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available data points including pre-game samples) to capture the current demand mean and variance while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. The product is a men's hoodie, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (61, 41, 106, 145, 133) and game history demand (91, 151, 79, 58) show significant volatility (mean ~96, range 41-151). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first arrival (from P1) is expected during Period 5's resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (ready for Period 6 decision). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 505 (sum of orders from P1-P4: 172+163+168+2 = 505). We have missed all demand so far due to zero starting inventory and the 4-period lead time. We need to set parameters to cover the next (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the recent demand levels more accurately than the full history, which includes lower initial samples. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the OR engine's critical ratio q = 0.5 will target the median demand, which is appropriate to avoid excessive stock-outs while minimizing holding costs.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The product is a jersey hoodie (Richie Hood). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period (samples: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133, 91, 151, 79, 58, 101). Recent demand (last 4 weeks) is slightly lower (avg 72.25) than the preceding month, suggesting a potential post-winter cooling. On-hand is 71, and there is a significant pipeline of 340 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total demand over 5 periods is ~490 units. Current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) = 71 + 340 = 411 units. This is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility and set L to default since the 4-period lead time was confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. We are managing a Men's Hoodie (Jersey Basic). Historical demand samples (before P1) were 61, 41, 106, 145, 133 (mean ~97). Since starting simulation (P1-P6), demand has been 91, 151, 79, 58, 101, 64 (mean ~91). The demand appears relatively stable with moderate volatility, though P2 was an outlier. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P5 show P1 arrival; P6 shows P2 arrival). On-hand is 170, and we have in-transit orders from P3 (168), P4 (2), P5 (7), and P6 (69) totaling 246. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the live simulation demand trend (avg ~91 per period). For L=4, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st, 2019. The product is a basic jersey hoodie. Historical demand from January to early February (pre-game) showed a spike (up to 145), but in-game demand (Periods 1-7) has stabilized at a lower level (mean \u2248 86). Specifically, the last four periods (P4-P7) show even lower demand (mean \u2248 70.5). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, and P3. Under the current base stock logic, we need to cover L+1 periods (5 periods). Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) accounts for the recent stabilization while acknowledging the seasonality of hoodies, which often see a slight decline moving into Spring (April). Sigma remains relatively stable. On-hand plus in-transit (279 + 116 = 395) is currently healthy relative to a 5-period demand forecast of ~350 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/08). Reviewing history, the actually observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The demand for this hoodie SKU shows a decelerating trend: initial historical samples [61, 41, 106, 145, 133] were followed by game periods [91, 151, 79, 58, 101, 64, 59, 46]. The mean of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 67.5, compared to the overall game average of 81.1 and the combined history+game average of 95.7. Since it is now April, moving further away from peak sweatshirt season, a lower demand mean is expected. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent cooling demand trend (P4-P8 mean = 65.6). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level q = 0.5; however, given lead time risk and volatility, maintaining a moderate safety stock via the OR engine's robust logic is appropriate. On-hand (235) + In-transit (114) = 349 units, which covers over 5 periods of recent demand (~328 units), suggesting minimal ordering is needed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a basic hoodie (Jersey Basic). Evaluation of the historical demand shows a clear declining trend as we move from late winter/early spring into mid-spring: demand has dropped from a peak of 151 (Period 2) down to 26 (Period 9). The last four periods show demand of 64, 59, 46, and 26. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 216 and demand dropping significantly, we have sufficient stock for the next several periods (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using a recent_N of 4 to capture this downward trend/seasonal shift, and \u03c3\u0302 similarly. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while demand cools off for this seasonal jersey item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: Demand has entered a sustained downward trend (avg ~49) compared to Periods 1-5 (avg ~96), likely due to seasonal warming.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). We are managing a hoodie (seasonal apparel). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has significantly declined due to seasonal warming, moving from an average of ~96 to ~42 over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). In the most recent week, demand dropped further to 15. We currently have 270 units on-hand and 38 in-transit (ordered P7). With an expected demand of ~42-50 units per week and a 4-period lead time, our inventory position (OH + Pipeline = 308) covers roughly 6-7 weeks of demand. Given the seasonal drop, we are currently overstocked. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. Mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the lower demand regime since the seasonal shift began. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to align volatility with the current lower-volume regime. This will likely result in zero orders until inventory depletes further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for P6-P10 is 42 units/period, down from 96 in P1-P5 (-56%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences a seasonal decline in demand as the weather warms up in the spring. Carry-over insights confirm a demand regime shift starting around Period 6. Recent demand (P6-P11) averages 43 units, significantly lower than the P1-P5 average of 96. Specifically, over the last 6 periods, demand has been 64, 59, 46, 26, 15, and 90 (mean = 50). The spike in Period 11 (90) is an outlier in the downward trend but suggests we shouldn't cut the forecast too aggressively. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory (218) is very high relative to recent demand (approx 4-5 weeks of cover). With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods. Current inventory (218) divided by recent average (approx 43-50) gives roughly 4.4 to 5 periods of cover. The OR backend will likely order nothing or very little given the high on-hand and declining trend. I will set L to 4 (default) and mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the post-shift average, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU is a 'Hoodie in sweatshirt fabric', which naturally sees lower demand as the weather warms into May. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-5 (pre-March 18) averaged 96 units, whereas Periods 6-12 (mid-March to end of April) averaged 55.7 units. The most recent two periods (P11 and P12) showed a spike to 90 units, contrasting with the very low demand in P9-P10 (26 and 15 units). This volatility suggests moving away from a global average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 128 units on-hand and 32 in-transit (P12 order arriving P16), total pipeline is 160. Total inventory covers nearly 3 weeks of the recent 'high' demand (90 units) or 5-6 weeks of the post-shift average (around 50). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility (90 vs 15). This prevents over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for the recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April: P11-P12 averaged 90 units compared to P9-P10 average of 20.5 units, though still below the P1-P5 winter average of 96.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the hoodie is entering late spring/early summer. Demand has been highly volatile: Periods 11-12 spiked to 90 units, but Period 13 dropped back to 49. The overall average since the Period 6 seasonal shift is 50.4 units, which is lower than the early winter average of 96. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P8-P11 were zero, which explains why no arrivals occurred in P12-P13. We are currently expecting arrivals from P12 (32 units) and P13 (104 units). On-hand inventory is 79. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand to capture the post-winter regime while accounting for the recent late-April spikes, ensuring we don't over-order as temperatures rise in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in May: following a spike of 90 in P11-12, P13 dropped to 49. Post-regime shift (P6-P13) average is 50.4 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are managing a hoodie (RICHIE HOOD), which typically sees declining demand as summer approaches. Historically, demand was high in Feb (~96 units/week) and dropped significantly in late March/April (down to ~20 in P9-10). However, demand spiked back to 90 units in P11-12 before settling into a more moderate range (49 and 36 units in P13-14). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P6-P14) is 53.1 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P11) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in P12, P13, and P14 (totaling 196 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P16, P17, and P18 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. To prevent overstocking as we enter summer, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture the post-winter regime while smoothing the late April volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to account for this recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 (2019/05/27). The product is a Richie Hood (hoodie), which typically faces declining demand as we enter summer. Looking at the history, demand has transitioned from a high winter average (~96) to a lower, more volatile spring/early summer regime. The last five periods (P11-P15) show demand of 90, 90, 49, 36, and 39. The most recent three periods (P13-P15) average 41.3 units, suggesting a stabilization at lower levels. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P1-P7 orders confirmed this). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) due to no arrivals from recent small/zero orders (P8-P11 orders were 0 or very small). However, the 'In-transit' quantity of 221 units reflects orders placed from P12-P15 (32, 104, 60, 25), which will start arriving in P16 (today) and subsequent periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (average of 60.8) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility of this transition period using the same N=5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Period 13-15 average demand is 41.3 units, significantly lower than early May peaks, confirming seasonal cooling for the hoodie category.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. We are managing a hoodie (seasonal item). Demand has stabilized at a lower level as we enter summer; the average demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 37.75 units. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived at P16). Total pipeline inventory is 268 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16), while on-hand is low at 9 units. Since L=4, my target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). Based on recent demand (~38/period), the required coverage is ~190 units. The pipeline of 268 units is already significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods. Therefore, the OR backend should minimize or skip ordering this period to avoid high holding costs as summer continues. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the current low-demand summer regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We are selling hoodies in June, which typically sees the lowest seasonal demand for heavy cotton-blend garments. The carry-over insights and historical data confirm this: demand has significantly dropped from a winter average of ~96 to a recent average of ~27.7 over the last 3 periods (P15-P17). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P16 and P17). With an on-hand inventory of 96 and in-transit of 164 (total 260), we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime. At an average demand of ~28, we have over 9 weeks of supply. Therefore, the OR backend should target a much lower base stock to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early June: Period 15-17 average demand is 27.7 units, reflecting peak summer seasonality for hoodies.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, 2019 (Period 19), we are in a low-demand regime for the Richie Hoodie, consistent with summer seasonality. The last three periods (15-17) showed an average demand of 27.7 units, and the most recent demand (Period 18) was 20. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (136 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 104 units in-transit (arriving in P20, P21, and P22). The sum of on-hand and in-transit (240 units) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable lead-time history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the summer demand floor (approx 26 units/period). This will likely result in zero orders this period due to the high inventory position, which is appropriate to avoid further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed for summer: Period 15-18 average is 26 units/period, down from early May spikes and winter averages.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in the heart of summer for this Richie Hood SKU. Demand has shown a clear downward trajectory: Period 15-19 demands have been 39, 27, 17, 20, and 9 respectively, confirming the summer seasonality previously identified. The current average demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 18.25 units. We have 152 units on hand and 79 units (from Period 16) in transit, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) = 5 period window given the current low-demand summer regime. Holding costs are significant ($1.0/unit), and the current inventory levels are high relative to demand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that reflect the current low-demand, low-volatility summer trough to avoid over-ordering, while relying on existing high on-hand stock and the incoming 79 units to satisfy the 95% service level goal. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent summer cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: July/June demand is significantly lower than spring, with P17-P19 averaging 15.3 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1, 2019, the demand for the RICHIE HOOD SKU has reached its seasonal minimum. Recent demand (P17-P20) has been extremely low: 17, 20, 9, and 7 units respectively, averaging 13.25 units per period. This aligns with the 'Summer demand trough' noted in the carry-over insights for a heavyweight sweatshirt product. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 224 units with zero in-transit. With the promised and observed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At the current consumption rate of ~13 units per period, the pipeline requirement is roughly 65 units. Since we have 224 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked for the current summer regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to reflect this trough in both mean and variance, which will result in no new orders being placed by the OR backend, allowing the excess inventory to be drawn down while minimizing holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand trough for hoodies (Period 22, July 8th). Looking at the history, demand has consistently declined from winter highs (~96 units) through spring, stabilizing at very low levels in late June and early July. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P19-P21) was 9, 7, and 29 units, with the previous several periods also staying low. On-hand inventory is currently 195 units with zero in-transit, which at the current average demand (approx. 15-20 units/period) represents roughly 10 periods of stock. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a target service level/quantile of 0.5), we are significantly overstocked. I will use the most recent 5 periods (N=5 from P17-P21) to capture this summer demand regime (average ~16.4 units). I will continue using the promised lead time of 4 as it remains stable in all observed 'conclude' messages. My parameters will lead the OR engine to place zero orders, allowing inventory to wind down towards the lower summer base stock level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), it is mid-summer, a traditionally low-demand period for hoodies. Demand has significantly decreased from the winter/spring peaks (which reached near 150 units/period) to a summer average. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), the average demand is approximately 21.8 units, compared to much higher historical levels. On-hand inventory is currently 151 units with zero units in-transit. This stock covers roughly 7 periods of demand at current rates, which is well above the (L+1=5) target. Because the Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making it even more important to avoid excessive holding costs in a low-demand season. I will use the recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to set mu_hat, reflecting the summer trough, and use default settings for lead time as the 4-period arrival remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (July): P18-P22 average demand is 21.8 units/period, roughly 15-20% of peak winter demand for this SKU.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22, which is the height of summer. The product is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodie), which typically experiences its lowest demand during these months. Recent demand reflects this seasonality, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 26 units. The on-hand inventory is 110 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, my base-stock needs to cover demand for Period 24 through Period 28 (L+1 periods). Based on the summer average of ~26 units/period, the total expected demand over those 5 periods is approximately 130 units. Since on-hand is already 110, I am slightly below my required stock level to maintain service levels if demand remains at this summer floor. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand regime and use the promised lead time (L=4) as it has remained stable.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (Period 25, 2019/07/29). The product is a hoodie, which is currently in its seasonal trough due to summer weather. Recent demand (P21-P24) has slightly increased (avg ~35) compared to the June/early July trough (avg ~15), but remains far below winter levels (~96). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (last arrival in P20 confirmed lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is 84 units, and 20 units are in-transit (ordered P24), totaling 104 units of pipeline inventory. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 periods (P20-P24) captures the current stabilized summer demand regime (avg 29.4). I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent stabilization and prevent over-ordering as we remain in the low-demand summer season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a hoodie (RICHIE HOOD). We are currently in the late summer 'trough' before the expected back-to-school/autumn demand spike. Recent demand has shown a significant uptick in Period 25 (78 units) compared to the previous summer average of ~20-30 units, suggesting the seasonal pivot has begun. As a hoodie is a cold-weather item, demand will likely increase through August and September. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units) relative to recent demand, and while 63 units are in-transit (ordered P24-P25), they won't arrive for 4 periods. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P16 order arrived P20). To capture the beginning of the autumn ramp-up and avoid stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging ~48 units/period) to reflect the recent demand surge while maintaining high volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against larger spikes.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand ramp-up detected: Period 25 demand (78) is significantly higher than the P18-P24 summer average (27.7), indicating the end of the summer trough for the hoodie category.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is entering its autumn ramp-up phase. Historically, demand was high in Feb/March (approx. 100/week) and fell to a summer trough in June/July (approx. 20/week). The last two weeks (P25: 78, P26: 70) show a clear and sustained breakout from the summer floor, aligning with back-to-school and cooler weather transitions. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 26 (demand 70, sold 6). The pipeline contains 146 units ordered recently (P24-P26), but with a lead time of 4 periods, these won't arrive for 2-4 more weeks. To capture the increasing seasonal demand and rebuild safety stock, I am moving to an 'explicit' forecast that reflects the current high demand regime (avg ~74 over the last two weeks) and setting lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period historical average. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 75 = 375 to account for the incoming 5-period demand window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up confirmed: Period 25-26 demand averaged 74 units/period, compared to P18-P24 average of 27.7 (+167% increase).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a confirmed Autumn ramp-up for the Richie Hood SKU. Demand in Period 25 (78), Period 26 (70), and Period 27 (130) shows a rapid increase from the summer trough (avg ~22). This aligns with back-to-school and cooler weather preparation. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (268 units) consists of orders from P24 (20), P25 (43), P26 (83), and P27 (122). Following the 4-period lead time, P24 (20 units) arrives in P28, and P25 (43 units) arrives in P29. However, current demand is exceeding these levels (reaching 130), meaning the pipeline is likely insufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon. I am shifting to an explicit forecast to capture this seasonal surge. I estimate the mean demand for the next 5 periods at approximately 120 units/period (based on the P27 spike and seasonal trend), totaling 600 for mu_hat. Volatility is also increasing, so I'm setting an explicit sigma_hat of 120 to provide a buffer against stockouts during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn surge confirmed: Period 27 demand spike to 130 units marks a clear transition from the ramp-up phase into a high-demand regime, nearly 500% increase over summer averages.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (hoodie) is experiencing a sharp seasonal autumn surge. Demand has spiked from a summer average of ~22 to 130 units/period over the last two weeks (P27-P28). This matches the transition from late August into September. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is backordered/missing demand. Total in-transit is 457 units (orders from P25-P28), with the next significant arrival (P25 order) expected in P29 (observed in P30). To capture the current high-demand regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to cover the ramp-up (P26: 70, P27: 130, P28: 130), resulting in an average of 110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Period 27-28 demand stabilized at 130 units/period, up from the ramp-up phase (avg 74) and summer trough (avg 22).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand Autumn regime for the Richie Hood SKU. Demand in Period 27-28 was 130 units, though Period 29 showed a dip to 58. Looking at the broader trend since the Autumn ramp-up (P25-P29), the average is approx 93 units/period (78, 70, 130, 130, 58). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are missing demand significantly. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 507, consisting of orders from P26 (83), P27 (122), P28 (209), and P29 (93). These are expected to arrive in P30, P31, P32, and P33 respectively. To ensure we meet the sustained Autumn demand and recover from stockouts, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent regime shift accurately. sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to account for the high volatility seen during this transition (stdev of ~33).

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime is volatile: P25-P29 average is 93.2 units, but individual weeks vary between 58 and 130.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9), entering the peak autumn demand season for hoodies. Demand has surged dramatically, with Period 30 showing a massive spike to 242 units, confirming that the autumn regime is significantly more aggressive than the initial August ramp-up. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and the in-transit pipeline (424 units) is primarily composed of orders from Periods 27-29, which should start arriving in Period 31 and 32. Given the seasonality and the recent demand spike, the prior average (P25-P29 avg ~93) is likely too low to reflect the current peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering the high-growth phase from P27-P30) to capture this surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using these recent samples will push the OR backend to place larger orders to recover from the stockout and prepare for sustained autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand surge: Period 30 demand spiked to 242 units, indicating the high-demand regime is significantly stronger than the initial August ramp-up (avg ~150+ vs ~93).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime for the hoodie SKU. Demand in Period 31 was 217, following a peak of 242 in Period 30. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 155.4 units, which is a massive increase over the summer trough. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand 0) due to this surge. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 568 (which includes orders from P28, P29, P31), we must ensure the 'in-transit' pipeline and any new order cover the (L+1)=5 periods of forward demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this new high-demand level (avg ~155/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility (ranging from 58 to 242) during this ramp-up phase. The backend will calculate the base stock for 5 periods of demand (~775 units) and order enough to cover the gap between that and our current 568 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime confirmed: Period 27-31 average demand is 155.4 units/period, a significant increase over the early Autumn ramp-up (avg 74) and summer trough (avg 22).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Richie Hood) has entered its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) has averaged 163.7 units, with the last three periods showing massive spikes (242, 217, 205). The current on-hand inventory is essentially depleted (4 units). While in-transit inventory is high (568), current demand is consistently hitting the 'cap' imposed by the OR backend, which is based on historical averages including the summer trough. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to meet this sustained high demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (P27-P32), which reflects current cold-weather seasonality. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn/Winter peak: Demand for P30-P32 averaged 221 units, confirming a significantly higher ceiling than the early Autumn ramp-up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RICHIE HOOD' has surged significantly as we enter late September, reflecting peak autumn/winter seasonality for hoodies. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike of 374 units, far exceeding the previous high-demand regime average (~155) and the more recent three-period average (~221). This suggests the 'Autumn peak' is intensifying. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and demand outstripping recent arrivals, we are currently stock-out limited. To maximize the base stock calculation and capture this accelerating trend while minimizing stock-outs, I am applying the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand weeks (Periods 31-33). For sigma_hat, I am using N=5 (Periods 29-33) to account for the increased volatility seen during this ramp-up. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn/Winter demand intensification: Period 33 demand reached a new high of 374 units, moving the 3-period average (P31-P33) to 265 units, up from the P27-P31 average of 155 units (+70% increase).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak Autumn/Winter demand regime for the RICHIE HOOD SKU. The demand in Period 33 reached 374 units and remained high at 259 units in Period 34. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 259.4 units, representing a massive seasonal shift from the summer trough. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1173 units in transit (ordered in P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the current date (October 7), we expect this high demand regime to persist or intensify as winter approaches. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full extent of this peak regime (averaging ~260 units/period). I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the high volatility seen in this period (peaks of 374 vs 217). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1=5) periods of high demand, aiming to refill the pipeline and mitigate the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand regime (P30-P34) average is 259.4 units/period, with high volatility (current max 374). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October), entering the peak autumn/winter season for the RICHIE HOOD SKU. Demand has intensified significantly, with the P31-P35 average at 267 units/period and high volatility (range 205-374). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Our pipeline inventory is currently 1031 units, reflecting large pending orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35. Period 34 saw arrived=0 because no order was placed in Period 30, but the P31 order arrived as expected in P35. To manage the high demand and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's default logic. This ensures we cover approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand (L+1) minus what is in transit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand regime (P31-P35) average demand is 267 units/period, significantly higher than earlier autumn ramp-up (P27-P30 avg 140). High volatility persists.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019, which is deep into the Autumn/Winter high-demand season for hoodies. Recent demand has stabilized at a very high level: the average demand of the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is 244 units, with P33 peaking at 374. However, Period 36 showed a slight cooling (169), suggesting we may have moved past the initial extreme surge into a more stable high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 66, and the pipeline is substantial (1060 units), primarily due to large orders placed in P33 (247) and P34 (451) which are expected to arrive in P37 and P38 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (post-September surge) while accounting for the recent moderation. Setting mu_hat to the average of this period ensures we maintain coverage for the L+1 window without over-ordering against the massive incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime stabilization: Period 31-36 average demand is 244 units/period, showing significant sustained volume compared to the August ramp-up (avg 74).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (685814001 - Richie Hood) is in its peak Autumn/Winter demand season. Recent demand (P31-P37) shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average of approximately 235 units per period. Although the most recent three periods (P35-P37) show a slight cooling from the late September peak of 374, demand remains robust (avg 198 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full breadth of this high-demand regime (since P31), providing a stable but responsive forecast. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to account for the significant volatility observed during this peak season. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during the current high-demand phase while accounting for the lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand regime (P31-P37) average demand is 235 units/period, showing sustained volume with a slight cooling from the 374-unit peak in P33.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter high-demand regime for hoodies. After a peak of 374 units in Period 33, demand has stabilized between 150-240 units. The last three periods (P36-38) show demand of 169, 185, and 152, suggesting a cooling trend from the peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 427 and in-transit at 599, we have a total pipeline of 1,026 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) covers the period since the major surge began in P31, capturing the current high-demand level while acknowledging the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to account for the high volatility seen in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand stabilization: Period 36-38 average demand is 168.7 units, reflecting a cooling from the 240+ unit peaks in early October but remaining well above summer levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019/11/11), the demand for the RICHIE HOOD SKU has transitioned from its extreme October peaks (up to 374 units) into a more stable late-autumn/winter pattern. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 184 units, significantly lower than the P31-P35 average of 267 units. This cooling suggests that the initial seasonal surge has leveled off. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory currently high at 376 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 575 units (total inventory positions covers roughly 5 weeks of current demand), I will shift the demand parameters to reflect this more recent, lower-volume regime. Using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to react to this stabilization and prevent excessive overstocking as we move deeper into the season.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in November: P35-P39 average demand has slowed to 184.2 units/period, compared to the October average of ~260-270 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter high-demand season for hoodies, but the initial extreme peak seen in late September/early October (P30-P34 avg ~265) has stabilized to a lower but steady level (P35-P40 avg ~185). Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 174, 185, 152, 175, 189, demonstrating consistency around the 185-unit mark. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 425 units, with 337 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39). Specifically, 94 units from P37 are expected to arrive in Period 41, and 143 units from P38 in Period 42. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand 425 + In-transit 337 = 762) is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average rate of 185 units/period. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the stabilized November demand regime (N=6, encompassing P35-P40), which helps prevent over-ordering as we move deeper into the season and avoid excessive holding costs from the previous high-order phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained November demand regime: Period 35-40 average demand has stabilized at 184.8 units/period, down from the October peak (P31-P34 avg 267).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (hoodie) is in its peak seasonal regime (late November). Demand has stabilized after the October peaks, with a most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) of approximately 183 units. While P41 saw a slight increase to 213, the overall November pattern (P35-P40) is consistent at roughly 185 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand 306 + In-transit 406 = 712) is high relative to the mean demand, but consistent with maintaining a high service level during the winter peak. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7, covering Oct-Nov stabilization) and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the P33 374-unit peak.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime confirmed: P35-P41 average is 188.3 units/period, showing stabilization below October peaks (~265) but well above early Autumn ramp-up levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike to 690 units (Date: 2019/11/25), which coincides perfectly with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This spike cleared out all 449 units of on-hand inventory, resulting in 241 lost sales. Historical data from Period 42 confirms the item is currently out of stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 496 units consists of orders from Period 39 (100 units, expected now in P43), Period 41 (163 units), and Period 42 (233 units). Given the date (Dec 2), we are entering the December holiday peak. The 690-unit spike is a seasonal outlier, but demand is expected to remain significantly elevated above the November average of ~188 units. To recover from the stockout and prepare for holiday demand, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I will set the per-period demand forecast to 250 units (reflecting a post-Black Friday but high-holiday level) which, over the 5-period horizon (L+1), results in mu_hat = 1250. This aggressive setting will signal the OR backend to place a substantial order to replenish stock and cover expected December sales.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 690 units, causing a stockout. December holiday demand regime expected to stay elevated above the November average (188 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 saw a massive spike of 690 units (Black Friday), followed by 156 in Period 43. Historically, December demand for hoodies remains elevated. The November stabilization mean was ~188 units, but the holiday spike significantly skews immediate averages. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a pipeline of 965 units (orders from P40-P43: 0, 163, 233, 569). The Period 40 'ordered=0' means no arrival is expected in Period 44 conclusion (visible in P45). However, significant arrivals are due starting Period 46. Given we are near the game end (P47) and currently stocked out, I will set mu_hat to capture the elevated December regime (avg of P41-P43 is ~353) to ensure the backend attempts to cover the remaining periods while managing the risk of overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: December holiday regime: Demand is highly volatile with a massive Black Friday peak (690 units) followed by a moderate week (156 units). Avg demand for P41-P43 is 353 units, reflecting sustained holiday interest compared to November's 188 avg.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the critical December holiday period (Period 45). Demand has been extremely volatile, with a massive Black Friday spike (690 units) and a moderate following week (156 units). The most recent demand was 249 units, which aligns with expected elevated December shopping activity. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to back-to-back stockouts from high demand and the 4-period lead time delay. In-transit inventory is high (1765 units), including large orders from Period 43 (569 units) and Period 44 (800 units) triggered by the stockout and holiday forecast. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (Period 39 order arrived in Period 43). To manage the remaining weeks of the year, I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the post-November surge (Avg demand P41-P44 is 327 units). Given the high volatility (690 to 156), I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for this uncertainty and ensure the OR backend target a robust base stock that prioritizes service level during the potential Christmas peak.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime confirmed: Period 41-44 average demand is 327 units/period, characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~246) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday spikes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the week of Christmas. Historical demand shows a massive peak during Black Friday/Cyber Monday (P42: 690 units) followed by a sustained high-demand December holiday regime averaging 327 units (P41-P44). Period 45 demand was 257. Given the SKU is a hoodie, high demand is expected to continue through the winter months. Total units in-transit is 1602, with a major order from P43 (569 units) expected to arrive in Period 47 conclude (visible P48) and an P44 order (800 units) expected in Period 48 conclude. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent stockout, the inventory strategy must cover the high holiday mean and volatility. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current high-demand December regime (Periods 41-45), which averages ~313 units per period. This balances the extreme Black Friday spike with more recent localized demand levels.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime (P41-P45) average is 313 units/period, reflecting high winter seasonality and holiday shopping peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the end of December (Period 47). Historical context shows a massive Black Friday spike (690 units) and a subsequent December holiday regime averaging approximately 313 units/period (P41-P45). The most recent demand (P46) was 158 units, suggesting the core holiday peak is passing. However, January typically retains higher demand for hoodies than summer months. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 75 units on-hand and 1369 in-transit (reflecting large orders from P43 and P44 arriving soon), the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts while being mindful of potential post-holiday cooling. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the holiday regime (P41-P46 avg ~270) and calculate for lead time as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling detected: Period 46 demand (158) is significantly lower than the P41-P45 holiday average (313). Monitoring for a shift to a lower-volume Winter/Spring regime.
