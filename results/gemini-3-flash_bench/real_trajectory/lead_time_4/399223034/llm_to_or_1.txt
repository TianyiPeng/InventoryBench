Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU 'Jeggings H.W'. Historical demand data shows five weeks: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11. There is a visible downward trend in demand from roughly 20-28 units/week to 11 units/week over the last two weeks. The product is 'Jeggings', which are generally staple items, but demand in early February may be seasonally lower before the spring uptick. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the order needs to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of all history (approx 18.2) for \u03bc\u0302 might be too aggressive given the recent drop to 11. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current average (18.2) but monitor for a confirmed regime shift if demand stays at 11. For the first period, I will stick to default lead time and standard deviation calculation methods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. History shows demand for the last five weeks (from external samples) was: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11. Demand in Period 1 was 12. There is a clear demand regime shift from an average of ~23 in Jan to ~11 in Feb. The current on-hand is 0 because the first order (31 units) is still in transit (Promised Lead Time = 4). We lost 12 units of sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the lower Feb demand (avg ~11.25) to avoid over-ordering, as the holding cost is significant ($1/unit). L is set to default (4) as we have no 'conclude' data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0 due to the 4-period promised lead time; no orders placed in P1 or P2 could have arrived yet. Demand in the first two weeks (12, 10) is consistent with the early February historical samples (11, 11). Product is 'Jeggings', a staple item, with no immediate seasonal demand spikes expected in late February. Recent historical demand (last 5 samples including P1 and P2) are: 21, 11, 11, 12, 10. This suggests a demand regime shift downward from the January peak (approx 23 units/week). I will use the last 4 samples (11, 11, 12, 10) to forecast future demand, setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate the base stock for the (L+1) exposure period (5 periods total). For L, I will use the promised lead time of 4 until we have arrival data to confirm otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is Jeggings (Ladies Denim), which usually has stable demand but can be seasonal. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (31 units), Period 2 (22 units), and Period 3 (4 units), totaling 57 units in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). However, current demand is being lost (sold=0) due to 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand samples (28, 20, 21, 11, 11) and recent in-game demand (12, 10, 6) show a declining trend. Averaging all 8 demand points gives ~14.8 units/period. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the lower demand regime seen in Feb/March) to reflect the recent slowdown and avoid over-ordering while waiting for the initial large shipments to arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is Jeggings, a staple item. Looking at the historical demand (28, 20, 21, 11, 11 from the pre-game samples and 12, 10, 6, 5 after the start), there is a clear downward trend in demand from the beginning of the year towards March. The average demand of the last 4 periods is 8.25 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order was placed in Period 1 (31 units). According to the lead time definition, an order with L=4 placed in P1 should arrive during P1+4=P5. Since we are at the start of Period 5's decision phase, it is expected that we haven't seen an 'arrived' message for the P1 order yet (it will appear in the Period 5 conclude message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 57 units in-transit. Given the wait for the first shipment and the declining demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent lower demand levels (N=4) to avoid over-ordering higher levels seen in January, while maintaining L at the default promised lead time until evidence suggest otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Jeggings. Current on-hand is 29, with 26 units in transit (ordered in P2 and P3). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Historical demand shows a declining trend: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11 (pre-game), and 12, 10, 6, 5, 2 (periods 1-5). The mean demand over the last 5 weeks is 7 units/week. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using a recent mean of 7, mu_hat should be approximately 35. The standard deviation of recent demand (12, 10, 6, 5, 2) is approx 3.9. Sigma_hat (sqrt(5) * 3.9) is approx 8.7. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to explicit (35) to reflect the low recent demand, and sigma_hat to explicit (10) for safety against the downward trend stabilizing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 order arrival in P5. Demand regime has shifted significantly downward from an average of ~18/week in Jan/Feb to ~7/week in Mar.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/25. We are seeing a sustained downward demand trend for the Jeggings SKU. The initial demand (Jan-mid Feb) averaged ~18 units/week, but the last four weeks (Periods 3-6) have shown significantly lower demand: 6, 5, 2, and 3 respectively (average of 4.0). This suggests a shift in seasonal demand or a 'cool down' for this specific style. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). We already have 48 units on hand and 4 in transit (total pipeline = 52). Given current demand levels (~4/week), we have approximately 13 weeks of supply, which is well above our target base stock for a 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime (4.0 * (1+4) = 20) and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the reduced volatility at this volume. No new orders are expected or needed this period as pipeline significantly exceeds forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Moving average dropped from ~18/week to ~4/week (77% decrease) over the last 4 periods (P3-P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Ladies Jeggings) has experienced a sustained and sharp demand drop. The initial sessions (Jan-Feb) saw demand between 11-28 units/week, but the last 5 periods (P3-P7) show a new low-demand regime: 6, 5, 2, 3, 7 units (average ~4.6). The inventory on-hand is currently 45 units, which is roughly 10 weeks of inventory at the current demand rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (confirmed as actual lead time in P5, P6, and P7), we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Current demand is approx 4.6 units/week, suggesting a target base stock of ~23 units. Since on-hand (45) + in-transit (0) = 45, no new orders are necessary. The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering, but I will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the significant downward shift in demand, avoiding bloated inventory targets while holding costs apply.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Jan/Feb averaged ~18 units (from provided samples), but the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have dropped to an average of 3.5 units (2, 3, 7, 2). The Carry-Over Insights already flagged this drop. Total on-hand inventory is 43 units, which is significantly high given the current demand rate and the promised lead time of 4. With L=4, the system covers 5 periods of demand. At the current rate of ~3.5 units/period, we need ~17.5 units in the pipeline; we have 43. No orders are currently in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product (Jeggings) has experienced a significant demand drop since March. Historical demand in January was ~20, February was ~10, and March/April (P5-P9) has crashed to an average of ~3.2 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders from P1, P2, and P3. Currently, there are 41 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the current demand pace (3.2 units/week). With L=4, the pipeline and on-hand should cover 5 periods of demand (approx 16 units). Since 41 > 16, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order to burn off excess inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime of the last 5 periods (P5-P9) to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low levels: Average demand since Period 5 is 3.2 units/week (March/April), compared to ~18 in January.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product 'Jeggings H.W' is in a low-demand regime. Historical demand in Jan/Feb averaged ~18 units, but since March (Period 4 onwards), it has dropped and stabilized at a mean of ~3.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 37 units with 0 in-transit. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Given the current inventory (37 units) and the low demand rate (forecasted ~16.5 units over the L+1 window of 5 weeks), the system is significantly overstocked relative to current sales. The OR backend needs to recognize this downward shift to halt ordering and allow inventory to deplete through natural demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' (which defaults to the observed 4 periods) and using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high early-year volume.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings'. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Jan/Feb averaged ~18 units (from historical samples), while the March/April period (P4-P11) has averaged ~4.1 units per week. Specifically, the last 4 weeks of demand have been 2, 2, 4, 5. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. With an average demand of ~4 units and a lead-time horizon of 5 periods (L+1), the current inventory (32) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (~20 units). Consequently, no new orders should be triggered. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7 covers the low-demand regime since March) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend realizes the forecast has dropped significantly, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Jeggings H.W', a denim product. Current date is May 6, 2019. Historically, demand was high in January/February (avg ~18) but dropped significantly in March/April. However, the last two periods (P11-P12) show a slight upward trend (5, 8 units) compared to the previous low average of ~3 units. This may indicate a stabilizing or slightly recovering demand regime as we move further into spring. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. With 24 units on-hand and zero in-transit, and a mean demand of roughly 5-6 units lately, 24 units covers about 4-5 weeks of supply. Given the lead time is 4, we are approaching the reorder point. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the low-regime and current slight uptick) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend captures the recent stability while being responsive to the slight increase in sales.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Jan/Feb averaged ~18 units/week (samples 28, 20, 21, 11, 11), while the period since March (Periods 4-13) has averaged only 4.2 units/week (5, 2, 3, 7, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8, 4). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in Periods 5, 6, and 7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 20 units with 2 units in transit, totaling 22 units of coverage. At the current demand rate of ~4.2 units/week, the 22 units provide over 5 weeks of coverage (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have sufficient stock for the lead time plus the review period, no aggressive ordering is needed. To allow the OR backend to stabilize around the current low-demand regime, I am choosing N=10 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, which encompasses the stable period from Period 4 to Period 13. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This product (Jeggings) experienced a significant demand drop after February, stabilizing at a much lower regime. Analyzing recent history (Period 5 to 14), the mean demand is approximately 3.7 units per week, compared to the January average of ~18. The last five periods show a slight uptick (avg 4.2) compared to the March/April lows, but demand remains low. With on-hand inventory at 20 units and in-transit at 5 units (total 25), and given an expected lead time (L) of 4, the total coverage is roughly 6.7 periods of demand (25 / 3.7). The OR backend's target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) suggests a safety stock profile. However, since inventory is already sufficient for more than L+1 periods, the OR engine will likely order 0 or very small amounts. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand regime since March, and 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time has been consistent in all observed arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Jeggings H.W', a denim product. Current date is late May (Period 16). Historical demand shows a significant decline from the initial Jan/Feb levels (~18 units/week) to a stabilized low-demand regime starting in March (~4 units/week). In the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 4.8 units/week, with fluctuations between 0 and 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 13 units, and 5 units are in-transit (ordered P13/P14), totaling 18 units of pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). At an average of 4.8 units/week, expected demand over 5 periods is 24 units. Since pipeline inventory (18) is below this requirement, the OR backend needs to place an order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the stable regime since Period 5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this best reflects the current low-demand environment while acknowledging recent slight volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17 (June 3, 2019). The product is denim jeggings, which usually sees stable demand outside of major seasonal shifts. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 4, 0, 7, 13) shows an increasing trend as we enter summer, with an average of 6.0 units/period, up from the spring average of ~3.2. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 12 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 13, 14, and 16). The order from Period 13 (2 units) is expected to arrive this period (Period 17) based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, and the Period 14 order (3 units) in Period 18. Given the stockout in Period 16 and the rising demand trend (moving average increasing), I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current upward momentum in demand while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. This helps the OR engine set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand regime of ~6 units/week across the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13: Average demand increased from ~3.2 to 6.0 units/week (+87%) moving into June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18 (June 10). There has been a massive demand spike in Period 17 (demand=98), likely due to a seasonal event or promotion involving skinny jeggings in early June. Historical data from Period 17 (2 units arrived) and on-hand (0) resulted in a major stockout, missing 96 units of demand. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P14 (3 units, expected P18), P16 (7 units, expected P20), and P17 (16 units, expected P21), totaling 26 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sudden regime shift from ~6 units/week to a high-demand state (98 last week), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent volatility and upward pressure, though the OR engine will cap the order based on safety stock logic. I use N=3 because the regime shifted definitively in Period 17, and including too much older data (May) would underestimate the current June demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike detected in Period 17 (98 units), likely seasonal for June. Previous estimate of 6.0 units/week is now obsolete; demand regime is highly volatile/peaking.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June). The product (Jeggings) has experienced a massive demand surge in June: 98 units in P17 and 73 units in P18, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This is a dramatic shift from the spring average of ~3-6 units/week. While we have 147 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed in P17 and P18), the earliest significant arrival (from P16's order of 7) is expected next period (P20), and the largest orders (124 units from P18) won't arrive until P22. Demand is currently averaging 85.5 over the last two weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these peak summer volumes over the next 5 periods (L+1). L is stable at 4. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=2) to reflect the high volatility seen in the June spike.

Carry-over insight: High-summer demand spike confirmed: Demand increased from ~6 units/week to 85.5 units/week avg in early June (P17-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for Jeggings (SKU 399223034), with recent weekly demand figures peaking at 98, 73, and 41 units (avg ~70.7). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by history (P13 and P14 orders arrived in P17 and P18). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 262 units in-transit (ordered P16-P19). The orders from P15 (0 units) and P16 (7 units) are expected to arrive in P19 (already concluded, 0 arrived as expected) and P20. However, P19 demand was 41 and we sold 0 due to stockout, indicating a significant inventory gap. To capture this high summer demand while managing the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P17-P19) to capture the spike average (~70.7 * 5 = 353.5). L is set to calculate as 4 is stable. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike confirmed (P17-P19): Average demand shifted to ~70 units/week from previous low of ~6 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for Jeggings starting in early June (Period 17). The demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) has been 98, 73, 41, and 34, averaging 61.5 units/week. This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~6. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (last observed arrival from P16 in P20). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 373 units in-transit. The substantial in-transit volume (ordered in P17, P18, P19, P20) is designed to meet this high demand, with the P17 order (16 units) expected to arrive in Period 21. Since the late-June demand shows a tapering trend (98 -> 73 -> 41 -> 34), I will use the average of these 4 periods to set mu_hat for the (L+1)=5 window. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific summer spike characteristic while acknowledging the recent deceleration.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for jiggings, though demand has tapered off from the peak of 98 units (P17) to 27 units (P21). The last five periods (P17-P21) show an average demand of 54.6 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 357 units in-transit (P18 order of 124 units is expected to arrive in P22, P19 order of 115 in P23, etc.). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), the backend's base-stock logic (q=0.8) will naturally attempt to keep service levels at 80%. I'm using a recent window (N=5) to capture this specific summer demand surge while allowing for the recent downward trend in the spike to reduce over-ordering risk, as we have significant inventory currently in the pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Ladies' Denim Jeggings) experienced a significant demand spike in June (averaging ~61 units/week across P17-P20), which has since cooled off during July to an average of 25 units/week in P21-P22. The inventory situation is improving: the P18 order of 124 units arrived in P22, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 101 units. In-transit inventory stands at 233 units (orders from P19 and P20). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In this regime, the target base stock needs to account for the L+1 window (5 periods). Using recent_N with N=6 captures the high-demand volatility of the summer season while incorporating the recent normalization. mu_hat should reflect the (1+L) period demand which spans the transition from peak summer to late summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime normalized in July (P21-P22) to ~25 units/week following the June peak (~61 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. The product is Jeggings, which saw a massive demand spike in June (averaging ~61 units/week) and has recently settled into a 'post-peak summer' regime. Average demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) is 40.6 units, but this is heavily skewed by a P23 spike of 72. Excluding that spike, demand was ~25 units. Looking at the broader July context (P21-P23), mean demand is ~40.6 with high variance. On-hand inventory is 144 and in-transit is 118 (from the Period 20 order, which is expected to arrive in Period 24 based on the stable 4-period lead time). Total inventory position is 262. Given the high summer volatility (sigma) and the risk of another spike like P23, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P20-P23) which average 39 units/week, to cover the (L+1) window. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen since the June spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in July: while early July demand averaged ~25, Period 23 saw a jump back to 72. Current July average (P21-P23) is 40.6 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (Ladies Jeggings) experienced a significant sales peak in June (average ~70 units/week), which has since transitioned into a lower but volatile July regime. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 220, In-transit: 0) following the arrival of large orders placed during the June peak. Analysis of June and July demand shows that while Period 17 and 18 were extreme (98, 73), the four most recent periods (P21-P24) show demand levels of 27, 23, 72, and 42 respectively, averaging 41 units per week. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (220 units) relative to recent demand, the goal is to stabilize inventory levels without over-ordering. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak July behavior (average ~41 units/week), which ensures that the base stock level remains sensible as the summer peak fades. No additional orders are likely to be triggered by the OR engine this period due to the high current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: July demand (P21-P24) averaged 41.0 units/week, significantly lower than the June peak (~70) but higher than the spring baseline (~6).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early August (Period 26). Historical data shows a massive demand spike in June (avg ~70) that moderated in July (avg ~41). The latest demand in Period 25 was 55 units, indicating that while the peak has passed, demand remains significantly elevated compared to the spring baseline (~6). With 165 units on hand and 27 in transit, and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The July average demand (P21-P25) is 43.8 units/week. Using N=5 for the most recent demand regime (July) balances the high volatility seen in the last few weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: August entry: July demand regime stabilized at an average of ~44 units/week, down from the June peak of ~70 but well above earlier levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for Jeggings remains high and volatile through late summer, with a recent spike to 97 units in Period 26, significantly higher than the July average of ~44. In-transit inventory (93 units) represents orders from Period 25 and 26, which are expected to arrive in Periods 29 and 30 given the confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods. With only 68 units on-hand and high recent demand, we need to maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts during the lead time. Given the recent volatilty (97 units this week following 55), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering P21-P26) to capture the current late-summer demand regime (average ~52) which is more representative than the full history or the June peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand in August: Period 26 demand (97) significantly exceeded the July average (~44), indicating continued summer volatility or a new high-demand regime for late summer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a high-demand late summer regime, with demand in the last two periods spiking to 97 and 123 (average ~110). Current on-hand inventory is 0. However, there are 193 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 25-27), with the first batch (27 units) expected to arrive in Period 29. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and local history confirming L=4 consistently, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, the recent demand (last 2-3 periods) indicates a significant upward shift compared to the July average of ~44; N=3 is selected to capture this late-August surge (avg of 55, 97, 123 is ~91 per period). I will use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a high service level for this volatile peak while accounting for the significant pipeline already in place.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge confirmed: Period 26-27 demand averaged 110 units/week, a +150% increase over the July average (~44). Record as high-volatility summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. We are in a high-demand late summer regime. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has been 97, 123, and 103, averaging 107.7 units/week. This is a significant increase from the July average of ~44. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in P27-P28, while in-transit inventory is 342. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have entered a sustained high-demand phase likely related to late summer/back-to-school trends, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this 107.7 average, and L to 4. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 3 samples to account for recent high volatility. This setting aims to recover from the stockout and meet the current high demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge confirmed: Period 26-28 demand averaged 107.7 units/week, a sustained +145% increase over the July average (~44).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 30 (early September). Historical demand for this denim SKU shows a significant late summer surge (late August), with the last four periods averaging 108.2 units (P26: 97, P27: 123, P28: 103, P29: 110). While we are out of stock (On-hand: 0), there are 446 units in-transit, including orders from P26 (66), P27 (100), P28 (149), and P29 (131). The order from P26 (66 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P30) based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Given the high demand and the high critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8), we must maintain a high base stock to avoid lost sales during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use the recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained high-demand level seen in August.

Carry-over insight: Late August/Early September demand regime confirmed: Average demand (P26-P29) is 108.2 units/week, maintaining the +145% surge identified previously.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a sustained late-summer/early-autumn high-demand regime, with Period 30 demand reaching 126 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 112 units per week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 497 units are in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a 5-period window (L+1) to ensure coverage during the lead time plus the current review period. Given the high profitability ($4) vs low holding cost ($1), a stockout-averse approach is warranted. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (since the start of the August surge) to capture the current high-demand environment without including the lower July data.

Carry-over insight: Late August/Early September demand regime: Average demand (P26-P30) has increased to 111.8 units/week, maintaining a sustained high-demand pattern into September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 26). For the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has consistently ranged between 97 and 127 units, with an average of 114.3. Despite large arrivals in P30 (66 units) and P31 (100 units), the SKU ended both periods with 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand exceeding supply. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 483 units, which includes orders from P28 (149), P29 (131), P30 (117), and P31 (86). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the persistent high demand in September, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture this regime accurately. This provides a forecast for the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks) that accounts for the current 114 units/week average. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility of this summer/fall peak.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains high and stable: Average demand (P26-P31) is 114.3 units/week, a slight increase from the late August average of 111.8.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jeggings H.W' remains in a stable but high regime that began in late August. Since Period 26 (late August), the demand has averaged approximately 113 units per week, significantly higher than July (avg 44) or June (avg 70). The most recent 7 periods (P26-P32) show demand values of 97, 123, 103, 110, 126, 127, and 100, which suggests a sustained high level into September. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 49 and in-transit at 447 units (representing orders from P29-P32), the pipeline is currently recovering from the stockouts experienced earlier during the demand surge. I will continue to use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat that captures this high-demand regime (N=7 to cover P26 to present).

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains high and stable: Average demand (P26-P32) is 112.3 units/week, consistent with the late August surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has remained high and stable throughout September, with an average demand of approximately 112.3 units/week since Period 26 (late August). The most recent demand observations (P30-P33: 126, 127, 100, 102) reflect a consistent high-demand regime as we move into October. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 78 and significant in-transit quantities (406 units) expected to arrive over the next few periods (reflecting orders from P30-P33), I will maintain parameters aligned with this stable high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=8 (covering P26-P33) for mu_hat captures this sustained late-summer/early-autumn peak accurately. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the variance observed during this specific regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains high and stable: Average demand (P26-P33) is 111.0 units/week, extending the surge identified in late August.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) is currently in a high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 26). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 34 is 111.1 units/week, which is remarkably stable compared to the volatile transitions earlier in the summer. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P25 through P30. Moving into October, we expect this high demand to continue or slightly taper as we move past the peak summer/back-to-school season, but currently, there is no evidence of a slowdown. The current inventory position (On-hand: 93, In-transit: 384) must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At ~111 units/week, the target inventory is roughly 555 units. Total pipeline is 477, suggesting a small inventory gap. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the current regime at P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures the current high-demand stability while being responsive to the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Sept/Oct): Demand has maintained an average of 111.1 units/week over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) with low volatility relative to the mean.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) remains in a high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 26). Over the last ten periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 107.1 units per week. The most recent period (P35) showed a slight dip to 80 units, but this is within normal variance for this high-volume regime and doesn't yet signal a downward shift, especially given the fall/winter seasonality for denim. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 99 units on-hand and 394 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35), we are well-positioned. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current sustained high-demand level while ignoring the much lower spring/early summer data.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Sustained high-demand regime (late Aug - Oct) confirmed with 10-period average demand of 107.1 units/week (P26-P35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 36 was 56 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding 10-period average of ~107 units. This may indicate the start of a post-summer/autumn cooling trend as we move into late October. However, because this is only the first significant dip below 100 in several weeks (previous period was 80), I will use a slightly shorter window (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the model to react to the potential downward trend while still accounting for the high demand seen in September. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. This SKU (Jeggings) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since late August (P26). However, the last two periods (P36-P37) have seen a noticeable decline in demand, dropping to 56 and 69 units respectively, compared to the previous 10-period average of ~111 units. This suggests the autumn/winter transition may be cooling off the summer/back-to-school peak. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With 177 units on-hand and 261 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, P36), the pipeline is well-stocked. To avoid over-ordering during a potential downward shift, I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the recent lower demand points while still weighting the high-demand context of the last five weeks (approx avg: 81.8 units/week). Setting L to 4 based on perfect historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: demand in P36-P37 (avg 62.5) is significantly lower than the P26-P35 average (~107). Investigating if this is a sustained seasonal shift for late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), we are observing a clear deceleration in demand following the high-volume late-summer/early-autumn regime. Demand in the most recent three periods (P36-P38) averaged 58.3 units/week (56, 69, 50), which is approximately 48% lower than the preceding 10-period average of ~111 units/week. This suggests a seasonal cooling as the product moves into the late-autumn period. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 222), and with a lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to lean into the current cooling trend while maintaining sigma_hat on a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the residual volatility of the previous regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Late October/Early November demand (P36-P38) has stabilized at an average of 58.3 units/week, a ~48% decrease from the September peak (~111).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has entered a cooling phase following the summer peak. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P36-P39) is approximately 54.8 units, which is a significant drop from the ~111 units/week seen in September. The current on-hand inventory (274) plus the in-transit amount (80) totals 354 units, which is approximately 6.5 times the current weekly demand, comfortably covering the lead time + review period (1+4=5 weeks). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition to a lower demand regime for the November period, as using a longer window would overestimate current needs and lead to excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Moving average dropped from ~111/week in September to ~55/week (50% decrease) over the last 4 periods (P36-P39). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-174.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has significantly cooled since the September peak (~111/week), dropping to an average of 49.3 units/week over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). The current on-hand inventory (310) is substantial given this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, and a pipeline plus on-hand total of 320 units, current stock covers approximately 6.5 weeks of demand at the recent rate of ~49/week. Over-ordering now creates a high risk of dead stock and holding costs by P47. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) to reflect this cooler late-autumn demand (avg 49.3, std ~14). This will allow the OR backend to stabilize the inventory level without triggering unnecessary large orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained: Late Oct/Early Nov demand (P36-P40) average is 50.6 units/week, down from September's ~111 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Jeggings) has cooled significantly from its September peak (~111/week) to a late autumn average of approximately 50.6 units/week (P36-P41). Period 41 demand was 58, slightly above the recent average but still within the 'cooled' regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (252 units) because large orders placed during the September peak arrived after demand had already dropped. With an average demand of ~51 and L=4, the required base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 255 units. Given that on-hand (252) plus in-transit (10) equals 262 units, we are already sufficiently stocked for the current demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering the cooling period from P36-P41) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the lower demand level and avoids over-ordering while we bleed off the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained: Late Oct/Mid Nov demand (P36-P41) average is 51.8 units/week, confirming a stable lower-demand regime for late autumn.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a massive, unexpected demand spike of 338 units, which completely depleted the on-hand inventory (262 units). This spike occurred on 2019/11/25, likely corresponding to Cyber Monday or Black Friday week, a major retail event. This significantly impacts the recent mean. Period 43 (2019/12/2) is the week following this event, where demand typically remains higher than the autumn baseline but lower than the holiday peak. The current inventory status is 0 on-hand and 20 in-transit (ordered in Period 42). To recover and prepare for December demand, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this high-volatility period. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat would average the spike (338) with the previous cooling period (~51), resulting in a safer coverage level. L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Massive seasonal demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (338 units), coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This overrides the previous 'cooling' regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 338 units, and Period 43 demand remained elevated at 122 units compared to the pre-holiday 'cooling' average of ~50. I previously ordered 320 units in Period 43 to restock from a stockout. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 340 units in-transit (20 from P42, 320 from P43). Given we are in the lead-up to Christmas, demand is likely to remain high but potentially lower than the Black Friday peak. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this seasonal elevation, using an average of the last two periods (approx 230 units/week), which for a 5-period window (L+1) totals 1150. Sigma_hat is set high to handle the extreme volatility seen in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42-43 demand averaged 230 units/week, a 350% increase over the early November baseline (~51), driven by Black Friday and December holiday shopping.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday shopping season (Period 45). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (338 units), and demand has remained elevated (Period 43: 122, Period 44: 130). However, the system is currently stock-out (On-hand: 0) because recent orders from the 'cooling' phase (Periods 37-41) were small or zero. We have a large pipeline (791 units), including orders from P42 (20), P43 (320), and P44 (451). The P42 order is expected to arrive in Period 46. Given the holiday rush and the stock-out status, I will maintain high mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters using recent observations (N=3) to account for the pivot from autumn cooling to holiday peaking. I'll use 'explicit' for mu_hat to safely project the (1+L) demand requirement (5 * avg(122, 130, 130 effectively)), and set sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility seen in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P44) average is 196.7 units/week, characterized by extremely high volatility (Black Friday peak of 338 followed by sustained ~130 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday season (late December). Historical demand shows a massive surge starting at Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday at 338 units), followed by a sustained high-demand regime averaging approx. 179 units/week over the last 4 periods (P42-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there is a large pipeline (961 units), the next major arrival (from the P43 order of 320 units) is not expected until Period 47 conclude (meaning it arrives during Period 47, and we only observe/sell it in Period 47/48). To handle the holiday peak and immediate post-holiday demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current holiday regime (mean ~179). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain high service levels during this high-volume period without over-ordering as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P42-P45): Mean demand shifted to ~179 units/week due to Black Friday and December shopping, with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, post-Christmas and heading into the New Year. The holiday demand regime (starting P42) is characterized by a massive Black Friday spike (338 units) followed by sustained high demand averaging ~125 units over the last four periods (P43-P46). Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and although 1075 units are in-transit, the system has suffered stockouts since P42 because arrivals haven't caught up with the surge. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P42 order arrived in P46). To ensure we cover the remaining holiday tail and enter January with sufficient stock, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 'Holiday' regime (last 5 samples, P42-P46, avg ~168) and sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 122 to 338). L remains at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition (Jan 2020): Expect demand to mean-revert from the holiday average of ~168 towards earlier autumn levels (~50-100) as peak shopping ends.
