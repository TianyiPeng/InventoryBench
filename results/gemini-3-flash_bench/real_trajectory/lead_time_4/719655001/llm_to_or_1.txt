Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 719655001 (Women's cotton/lace underwear). Current on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0. Data from the last 5 weeks shows demand levels of [99, 127, 104, 87, 146], with an average of 112.6. The product description suggests a stable basic item, but the recent 146 (Feb 4) might indicate a slight uptick or volatility. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all 5 available historical samples provides the most reliable statistical base for this initial order to bridge the lead time gap and establish safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Demand history shows a steady trend (approx 113 avg) until a significant jump in Period 1 (173). Product description (Women's Lingerie/Briefs) suggests possible seasonal demand related to Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which explains the spike in the Period 1 conclude message (covering the week of Feb 11). Historical samples for Jan/early Feb averaged 112.6, while P1 was 173 (+53%). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 152 in-transit (ordered P1, promised L=4). Since the Valentine's spike has likely passed, demand should stabilize. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to include the spike while considering the base trend, and default for sigma/lead time as we have no evidence yet to deviate from promised values or historical volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is women's cotton lace underwear. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (99, 127, 104, 87, 146, 173, 199), with the most recent two weeks averaging 186 units. This demand growth aligns with the lead-up to early spring. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 (372 units of lost sales). A total of 333 units are in-transit from orders placed in Period 1 and 2. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the Period 1 order (152 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent high demand (avg ~162), and default for sigma_hat and L as there is no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or long-term volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs. Historically, demand has been: [99, 127, 104, 87, 146] (pre-game) and [173, 199, 147] (Periods 1-3). The mean demand across all 8 available samples is approximately 141.5 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (as expected given L=4). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 552 units (152+181+219). I will use the 'default' lead time method (promised L=4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent uptick in demand observed since the game started (averaging 164 over the last 5 samples) compared to the earlier samples. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's underwear (Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and will be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at the start of P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (P1-P4 are still in transit). Historical demand shows a peak in mid-February (weeks of Feb 11 and Feb 18) followed by a decline. Average demand across all 9 samples (5 historical + 4 game history) is 127.7 per week. Since the promised lead time is 4, base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent downward trend from the Feb peaks towards the pre-game baseline, while maintaining lead time at 'default' until actual arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster underwear. Historical demand shows a peak in February (Period 1-2: avg 186) followed by a cooling off in March (Period 3-5: avg 114.6). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the Period 5 conclude message confirms the Period 1 order arrived exactly on time (L=4). Currently, we have 51 units on hand and 609 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since demand has stabilized at a lower level after the initial February spike, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 4, as it was confirmed by the first arrival. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the lower March demand (avg ~115) rather than the higher initial levels. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster panties. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current inventory is 140 units on-hand with 428 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). Historical demand data suggests a decline from early February peaks (avg ~149) to recent levels (avg ~96 for the last 3 periods). Given that women's lingerie/basics often have relatively stable but seasonal demand, and we are moving away from the Valentine's period, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P2-P6: 199, 147, 96, 101, 92, avg=127) to capture this downward adjustment. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 4-period lead time. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6). Demand regime shift: early Feb highs (170+) have settled to an average of ~96 over the last three periods (P4-P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is women's cotton lace underwear. Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand regime in late February (avg >170 units) followed by a stabilization to a lower regime starting around early March (Period 4). The last four periods (P4-P7) show demand of 96, 101, 92, and 112, which averages to 100.25 units per period. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods (as seen in Conclude messages for P1, P2, and P3). On-hand inventory is healthy at 247, and in-transit is 276 (orders from P4, P5, and P7). To account for the shifted demand regime, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing the stable March data) and use the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: March demand (P4-P7) settled to a mean of ~100 units from the Feb peak (>170). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a pack of cotton hipster briefs, a staple item with fairly stable demand. Looking at recent history, demand has transitioned from a high of ~170 in early February to a steady mean of approximately 103 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8: 96, 101, 92, 112, 115). Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival pattern of orders from P1 through P4. Currently, we have 332 units on-hand and 76 units in-transit (67 from P7 and 9 from P5 - wait, P5 order was 9 units, P7 order was 67 units; both are still in transit). The base stock calculation for the OR engine with L=4 and demand mean ~103 should be roughly (1+4)*103 = 515. Our current pipeline (on-hand 332 + in-transit 76) is 408. The OR engine will likely place a small replenishment order. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the stable post-February 'regime'.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P10 (2019/04/15). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed from orders placed in P1-P5 arriving in P5-P9). Demand has shifted following the early February peaks (>170). Over the last 6 periods (P4-P9), demand has averaged approximately 94.8 units (96, 101, 92, 112, 115, 53). The drop in P9 to 53 units is a notable outlier compared to the previous stable range of 90-115, but it's too early to declare a new permanent regime. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this post-peak stabilization while accounting for the recent dip. This will set mu_hat based on (1+L) * ~95 = 475. With On-hand (288) and In-transit (175) totaling 463, the OR backend will place a small order to reach the calculated base stock level, maintaining a safe service level during this period of moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P9 (down to 53), but the post-peak mean (P4-P9) remains ~95 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the product (Women's cotton/lace hipster briefs) and history, we saw a demand peak in Feb (~170/week) which has since declined. Over the last 7 periods (P4-P10), demand has averaged 88.8 units, but the most recent 2 periods have been significantly lower at 53 units each. This suggests a potential new lower regime or a seasonal lull. Currently, we have 235 units on-hand and 187 in-transit (orders from P7, P9, and P10). With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, our 'pipeline' needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (avg 88.8) results in a base stock target of ~444. Our current inventory position is 422 units (235 on-hand + 187 in-transit). Given the latest demand drop to 53, I will use recent_N = 7 to weight the recent lower demand while acknowledging the volatility. This sets a conservative base stock target to avoid overstocking in a potential low-demand phase for basic lingerie.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift: P9-P10 demand dropped to 53 units, bringing the post-Feb average (P4-P10) down to 89 units from the previous ~100.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie) has shown a clear downward shift after the February peak. Over the last three cycles (P9-P11), demand has been 53, 53, and 67, averaging 57.7. This is significantly lower than the March average of ~100. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 11 conclude: P7 order arrived in P11). On-hand inventory is currently high (235 units), which covers approximately 4 periods of the current demand regime. With an additional 143 units in-transit (P9, P10, P11 orders), we are well-stocked. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (~58 units/period), and lead time L to the confirmed 4 periods. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), which implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), the backend base stock will target the mean, helping to burn off excess inventory while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P9-P11 demand averaged 57.7 units, a ~40% drop from the March average (~100).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Product demand for 'Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie) showed a sharp spike in February (147-199), stabilized in March (92-115), and then experienced a downshift in April (53-67) before a significant rebound in the most recent Period 12 (157). The carry-over insights correctly identified the April drop, but Period 12 suggests that either demand is volatile or a seasonal shift (approaching summer/warmer months) is occurring. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current on-hand (78) and in-transit (143) total 221 units. To account for the recent rebound while acknowledging the lower April baseline, I will use a recent_N of 4 (Periods 9-12) for mu_hat to capture the current volatility and average (approx 82/week), resulting in an expected 5-period demand (mu_hat) around 412. Given high Holding costs equal to Profit ($1.0), the OR backend's service level target (z*) will naturally be conservative (~50%).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in May: Period 12 demand (157) is nearly 3x the April average (57.7), ending the previously noted downshift regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending May 6 (Period 13) dropped back to 57, following a spike of 157 in Period 12. This suggests that Period 12 was likely a temporary outlier or a short-lived seasonal spike rather than a sustained new regime. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (Period 9 order arrived on time in Period 13). Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 with 200 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, and P13). Using a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat) captures the post-February stabilization and recent volatility without being overly skewed by the extreme highs of the first three periods. Lead time (L) is kept at the default promised value of 4, which aligns with all historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: P12 (157 units) followed by P13 (57 units) indicates high variance but no sustained shift from the post-Feb average of ~90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11, P9->P13, P10->P14). Demand has been highly volatile in May (P12: 157, P13: 57, P14: 59). Measuring from the end of the initial February peak (starting P4), the average demand over the last 11 periods is ~88.4 units. Since the April 'downshift' was followed by a massive spike in P12 and then a return to lower levels, the demand is best modeled by looking at this entire post-peak window (P4-P14, N=11). This captures both the lower April levels and the high May volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the 311 units in-transit (orders from P11, P13, P14) plus 82 on-hand are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). L is set to default (4) as consistency is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: P12-P14 show high variance (157, 57, 59) but the long-term post-Feb mean (P4-P14) remains stable at ~88 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). Demand has shown significant volatility in May (P12: 157, P13: 57, P14: 59, P15: 78). The average demand over the last 12 periods (P4-P15) is approximately 87.5 units, which is a more stable representative of the current regime than the early Feb peak. Due to the high recent volatility (standard deviation ~32), mu_hat is set using the last 12 samples (recent_N=12) to capture the post-peak mean, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=12 to properly reflect the increased variance observed in May. On-hand inventory is low (27), but there is a significant pipeline (333) including the P13 order (165) and P14 order (123) expected to arrive in P17 and P18 respectively. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Post-Feb demand regime (P4-P15) established with mean ~88 and increased volatility in May (std ~32).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/03. Period 16 concluded with an on-hand inventory of 0 and a stockout (sold 27 vs 92 demand), as no arrival occurred. Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Orders from Period 12 (0 units), 13 (165 units), 14 (123 units), 15 (45 units), and 16 (74 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the 165 units ordered in Period 13 to arrive during Period 17, which will resolve the stockout. Demand has entered a post-February regime (P4-P16) with an average of approximately 88 units but significant volatility in May (P12-P16 averages ~89, but ranges from 57 to 157). I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this post-February regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L estimate at 4 periods using the calculate method.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18 (June 10). The product is cotton hipster briefs. Demand in Period 17 spiked to 178, confirming a significant seasonal increase in June, similar to the high demand seen in early February (>170). The post-Feb average (approx 90) no longer reflects current market conditions. The last four periods (P14-P17) show demand of 59, 78, 92, and 178; while highly volatile, the upward trend represents a regime shift for the summer season. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the P17 spike, and there's a stockout risk. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use the last 4 periods (P14-P17) to capture this rising demand trend and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon during this peak. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike confirmed in June: Period 17 demand reached 178 units, a significant increase from the May average (~90), mirroring early February levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719655001' (Womens Briefs) has entered a clear seasonal demand spike in June (Period 17: 178, Period 18: 153), mimicking the high-volume regime seen in February. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods) because previous orders didn't anticipate this June surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the shift from an average of ~88 to over 150 units per week, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new regime using an 'explicit' forecast. A conservative estimate for demand during the L+1 window (5 periods) is 750 (150 units/period * 5). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the June spike. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal spike confirmed: Demand increased to ~165 units average (P17-P18), returning to levels seen in Feb. This follows a stable period of ~88 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a June seasonal demand spike (Date: 2019/6/24). Demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged 168 units, which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~90. On-hand inventory is 0 for the fourth consecutive period due to this unexpected surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P17 order P13, P18 order P14, P19 order P15 all showed lead_time=4). To capture the current high-demand regime and avoid under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P17-P19). This shift to N=3 allows the OR engine to react immediately to the spike, as the product (women's lingerie briefs) appears to be in a peak season. The pipeline inventory (526 units) covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand, so additional orders are necessary to prepare for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal spike established: P17-P19 demand average is 168 units, significantly higher than the previous 88-unit baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719655001 is in a confirmed high-demand regime since early June (Period 17). Demand for the last four periods (P17-P20) has been 178, 153, 173, and 200 units, resulting in a recent average of 176 units per period. This shift significantly exceeds the previous baseline of ~88-90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 642 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the parity between profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (z=0), meaning the base stock goal is roughly (L+1) * mean demand. To capture this sustained June/July seasonal spike, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the current regime P17-P20). This ensures the OR engine computes demand expectations based on the current high-velocity period rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak continues: P17-P20 mean demand reached 176 units, confirming a sustained seasonal high from the previous ~88 unit average (+100%).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719655001' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained July seasonal peak. Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has averaged 176.2 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~88 units. This peak mirrors the initial high demand seen in early February. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand exceeding arrivals. There is a substantial in-transit pipeline (821 units) representing orders from P18-P21. To maintain a high service level during this peak, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime metrics. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak stabilized: P17-P21 mean demand is 176.2 units with a standard deviation of 16.5, confirming a sustained high-demand regime similar to the February peaks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719655001' (Womens Briefs) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by summer seasonality. Since Period 17 (early June), weekly demand has consistently remained high: 178, 153, 173, 200, 177, and 148 units. The average demand over these last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 171.5 units, which is nearly double the spring baseline of ~88 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (most recently confirmed in P22 with the P18 order arriving exactly on time). On-hand inventory is currently low (41), but in-transit inventory is high (692), representing large orders placed during the peak. To maintain adequate stock for the current (L+1)=5 period lead time window, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent 6-period regime (approx 171.5 * 5 = 857.5) and sigma_hat to account for the peak's volatility (std is approx 18.6, so sqrt(5)*18.6 \u2248 41.6). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine prioritizes current summer demand over the lower spring averages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand summer regime confirmed (P17-P22): Average weekly demand is 171.5 units, a ~95% increase from the spring baseline of ~88 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/22. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand summer regime that began in June. For SKU 719655001 (women's hipster underwear), demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the spring baseline. Since Period 17 (June start), the demand mean has been approximately 173 units (P17-P23 range: 148-200). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. To capture the current regime properly, I will use a N=7 window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of the June peak. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 170+ unit demand level plus the associated volatility (std dev in this peak period is ~17). On-hand is currently 115, with 583 in transit. Setting L to default (4) ensures the backend calculates for a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-29.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/29. Historical data confirms a sustained high-demand summer regime that began around Period 17 (early June). From Period 17 to Period 24, the average demand is 165.8 units, which is significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~88. The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show demand of 148, 160, and 138 (mean = 148.6), suggesting the peak might be slightly softening but remains high compared to the spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). Consequently, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from P17-P24) to capture the current seasonal average of approx 166 units per period. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime (P17-P24) average is 165.8 units, compared to spring average of 88 units. Demand in the last 3 weeks (P22-P24) has moderated slightly to 148.6 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/05. Analysis of the summer demand regime (P17-P25) indicates that demand has moved from a peak of ~176 units (P17-P21) to a slightly lower, more moderated level of ~141.3 units over the last four periods (P22-P25: 148, 160, 138, 126). This suggests the peak summer seasonality is cooling off as we enter August, though it remains significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~88 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P21 order arrived in P25). To ensure the OR backend correctly models the current moderated-high demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand summer regime (P17-P25), which balances the early peak with the recent cooling. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 455) and On-hand (249) are sufficient to cover current demand, so these parameters will maintain a safe base stock without over-ordering as the season potentially transitions.

Carry-over insight: August moderation: Demand in the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has averaged 143 units, down from the June/July peak of ~176 units, indicating a cooling of the summer spike.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data confirms that the summer peak (June/July) which saw demand consistently above 170 units has begun to moderate. In the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 145.6 units (148, 160, 138, 126, 156), which is lower than the ~176 peak but still significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~88. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P22 order arriving exactly as expected in P26. We are currently in an 'August moderation' regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly lower but still elevated demand level, ensuring the OR backend targets the 145-unit mean while accounting for the recent volatility (std ~14). This should prevent over-ordering as the summer surge continues to cool.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand have moderated from the July peak (avg ~176) to an August average of approximately 143 units (last 4 periods: 138, 126, 156, 151). This represents a stable but lower demand regime compared to the summer high. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. On-hand inventory is 127 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 450 units. To set parameters for the OR backend, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this August moderation (mean ~143). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current stabilization in volatility. Lead time L is set to default (4 periods) as observed behavior matches the promised timeframe.

Carry-over insight: August demand moderation: The summer peak has subsided to a stable August average of ~143 units (P24-P27), down from the ~176 average seen in June/July.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand summer peak (June/July) that has begun to moderate throughout August. Specifically, the 'summer spike' (P17-P21) averaged ~176 units, while the last four-week period (P25-P28) has settled to a mean of 141.5 units (126, 156, 151, 133). This indicates a shift to a lower, more stable regime for late summer/early autumn. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0) for the base stock calculation, effectively placing orders to meet expected demand. To accurately reflect the current moderation and avoid overstocking as the peak fades, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the August average of ~141.5 units and its associated lower volatility compared to the high-summer peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high peak in February (~173 units), a spring dip (~88 units), and a summer peak in June/July (~176 units). Demand is now in a post-summer moderation phase, averaging approximately 130 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 151 units and in-transit is 444 units. I will set mu_hat to capture the current moderated demand level using the last 4 samples (N=4) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L+1) without overstocking as the summer peak fades into autumn. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand moderation confirmed: Period 26-29 demand averaged 130.7 units, down ~25% from the June/July peak (~176 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand analysis shows a clear downward trend following the summer peak (June/July ~176 units). The most recent regime (P26-P30) shows demand has further moderated to an average of 125.8 units (156, 151, 133, 113, 116). This represents a transition from high summer demand to a stable early autumn level. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P22-P26. To align with this new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the stabilization around ~126 units, rather than the historical average which is skewed by the summer surge. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This approach balances the stock levels for the current (1+L=5) period risk window.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: P26-P30 demand has stabilized at a mean of ~126 units (down from ~176 in July and ~143 in early August).

The last six periods (P26-P31) show a mean demand of 127.3 units (156, 151, 133, 113, 116, 95), with the most recent four periods (P28-P31) averaging 114.25 units. The date is mid-September, and traditionally demand for basic lingerie styles stabilizes after summer peaks before potential holiday shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all concluded shipments. Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0) to minimize the sum of costs. Setting N=6 for mu_hat captures the transition to this lower 'post-summer' baseline, and setting N=10 for sigma_hat provides a robust volatility estimate that includes both recent stability and the end of the August fluctuations. L is kept at the reliable promise of 4.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Analyzed demand for SKU 719655001 shows a significant cooling trend following the summer peak (June/July ~176 units). The most recent demand (Period 32) was 61 units, following a stabilized August/early September average of ~126 units (P26-P30). This suggests we are entering a new, lower demand regime consistent with autumn seasonality for basic lingerie. Mean demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 90.6 units. To avoid overstocking while demand is trending downward, I will use a recent_N calculation with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this deceleration. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by arrival messages (e.g., Period 32 arrival was from Period 28). Current on-hand (196) and in-transit (380) units are sufficient, so the OR backend will likely moderate the order size based on the updated mu_hat (~453 total for L+1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P26-P31 avg ~126 units); newest evidence suggests further deceleration in late September (P32 demand 61 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 719655001 is currently in a post-summer moderation phase. After a high-demand summer regime (~166 units), the mean demand for April through August (P26-P31) settled around 126 units. However, the last two periods have shown high volatility: P32 dropped to 61 units, while P33 spiked to 160 units. The average of the last four periods (P30-P33) is 108 units, suggesting a further decline as we enter autumn, though the volatility is significant. Historical lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 163 units on-hand and 253 in-transit (orders from P30-P32), the pipeline is relatively healthy. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the shift from late summer to autumn (mean ~115) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition confirmed (P30-P33): mean has moderated to ~108 units from the early-September stabilization of ~126 units, characterized by high weekly volatility (range 61-160).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has transitioned into an autumn regime. While Period 33 saw a spike to 160, the surrounding weeks (P31: 95, P32: 61, P34: 102) and previous insights suggest a moderation from the summer peak. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 107 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this autumn deceleration while accounting for the high volatility (61 to 160) observed in the recent data. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P29 arrived in P33, P30 arrived in P34), so the 'calculate' method is appropriate. sigma_hat should also reflect this recent high volatility to maintain service levels during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition stabilized: Demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has averaged 107 units, reflecting a clear step down from the August average of ~130 units and the July peak of ~176. Recent volatility is high (std ~36 in P30-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized into an autumn regime following the summer peak. The last 5 periods (P31-P35) have shown an average demand of 113 units, though with notable volatility (ranging from 61 to 160). Period 35 demand was 107. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the OR backend focus on the mean demand. Pipeline inventory (283) plus current on-hand (144) totals 427 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of the current mean demand (113 * 4 = 452). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P30-P35) to capture this stabilized autumn mean (~113.5). Sigma_hat will also use the last 6 periods to account for the recent seasonal volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the default of 4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Historical demand shows a post-summer moderation phase. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 108.8 units, which is consistent with the 'Autumn transition' noted in carry-over insights. The most recent demand (P36) was 121 units, slightly above the recent mean but within the observed volatility range (61-160). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P32 order arriving in P36. To reflect the current stabilized autumn regime, I will use a restricted window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~109) and the moderate volatility (std ~30) without being skewed by the significantly higher summer peak (~176). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October (Period 38). The 'autumn transition' (P30-P34) saw demand average 107 units. However, recent weeks (P36-P37) have shown a significant uptick (121 and 153 units respectively), likely heading into a pre-holiday season or late autumn peak. The 'conclude' message for P37 shows a stockout (sold 86 of 153 demanded), meaning total on-hand is 0. An order from P33 (0 units) means no arrival in P37, and the P34 order (180 units) should arrive in P38 (visible in P39). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the recent demand increase, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P33-P37) to capture the trend from 107 back up towards ~130, while maintaining high sigma_hat to account for recent volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Late October uptick: Demand in P36-P37 (avg 137) suggests a departure from the P30-P34 autumn average of 107, possibly indicating the start of a pre-holiday ramp-up.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering early November (Period 39). Historical data and previous carry-over insights indicate a pre-holiday ramp-up. Demand in the last three periods (P36-P38) has averaged 134.3 units, compared to the early autumn average of 107. Given the upcoming holiday season (November/December), I anticipate demand will either stabilize at this higher level or continue to increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P34 order arrived in P38). With on-hand inventory at 51 and in-transit at 452 (covering P35-P38 orders), the pipeline is healthy, but we must maintain stock to handle the volatile pre-holiday demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand uptick, setting the OR backend to calculate base stock for a 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Holiday ramp-up confirmed: Demand in P36-P38 (avg 134.3) is ~25% higher than the Sept/Oct autumn baseline of 107.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the middle of a holiday ramp-up period for this SKU (Womens Lingerie). Demand in the last four periods (P36-P39) has averaged 127.5 units, which is a ~20% increase over the September/October average of 107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the last 4 periods (P36-P39) to define the current demand regime, as it captures the shift from the autumn baseline to the higher pre-holiday levels. mu_hat will be set to (1+4) * mean(P36-P39) \u2248 637.5. sigma_hat will be calculated from the same recent window to capture the holiday volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently 574 units with 0 on-hand, so the backend will order approximately 64 units to reach this base stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand shift established: P36-P39 demand (avg 127.5) confirms a sustained 20% increase over the autumn baseline of 107.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18, heading into the peak holiday season. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained holiday demand shift (P36-P39 avg ~128). Demand in the last period (P40) was 117. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to sustained high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P36 order arriving in P40). To capture the holiday peak and prevent stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus on the current holiday regime (avg ~126), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high seasonal volatility (std ~18 over the last 5 periods). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the consistent 4-period historical average. This should target a base stock sufficient for the L+1 window of higher year-end sales.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25, entering the peak holiday shopping season (Black Friday week). Historical demand shows a sustained 'holiday ramp-up' regime starting around Period 36, with the Period 36-41 average demand at approximately 125.5 units. Given the proximity to late November and December, demand is expected to remain high or increase slightly. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), while in-transit inventory is 496 units, including expected arrivals from orders placed in Period 38 (173 units) and Period 39 (162 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). I will use the recent_N method with N=6 (Periods 36-41) to capture the current holiday regime mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the established 4-period lead time and the current demand elevated levels.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand shift (P36-P41) confirmed: average demand is 125.5 units, representing a sustained ~17% increase over the autumn baseline of 107 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we observed a massive demand spike to 385 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This is significantly higher than the previous holiday baseline of ~126 units. As we are now in early December (Period 43, Dec 2), we must account for this extreme volatility while recognizing that such a peak might be a one-time event or have a 'long tail' into the holiday gift-buying season. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 450 units in transit (expected from orders in P39-42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock is simply the expected demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid over-reacting to a single spike while acknowledging increased December demand, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the holiday lift (P36-P42 average is ~163) and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in P42.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed in Period 42: Demand reached 385 units, a ~200% increase over the Nov baseline (~126). High volatility expected through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 showed a significant Black Friday spike (385 units). While Period 43 demand moderated to 111, this is expected between major shopping events. Given the product is a lingerie item (Greta Ch hipster 3p), demand typically surges through mid-December for holiday gifting and then again for post-holiday sales/seasonal transitions. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the remaining holiday peak. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 165 units per period. This is based on the pre-Black Friday holiday mean (~127) adjusted upwards (+30%) to account for sustained December gifting demand, though not as high as the single-day BF spike. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 80 to account for the high volatility observed in late Q4 (range 111-385). This ensures the OR engine maintains a high service level during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime: Period 42-43 shows extreme variance (385 to 111). Expect sustained high demand (~1.3x November baseline) through Period 46.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), following the Black Friday spike (P42, 385 units) and the subsequent stabilization in late November/early December (P43-P44, avg 108). Historical patterns and product category (Womens Underwear) suggest demand will remain elevated throughout the December holiday season before dropping in January. Current on-hand is low (10 units), but in-transit is very high (710), including orders from P41-P44. The order placed in P41 (97 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P45. Demand in the most recent regime (P36-P44, excluding the P42 Black Friday outlier) has averaged 125.4 units with a standard deviation of 16.2. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 (back to P36) to capture this holiday baseline while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering from the P42 spike. L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Dec 23). Historical demand for this period shows high volatility following Black Friday (P42 demand 385, P43-P45 demand averaging ~111). Retail patterns for underwear/briefs typically see sustained interest throughout December before slowing in January. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P43, P44, and P45). In-transit inventory is high (646 units), reflecting recent large orders (325 units in P43 and 161 in P44). As we approach the end of the year, I expect demand to remain slightly elevated for one more week before dropping. I will use a recent_N average (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the post-autumn holiday levels while smoothing out the extreme P42 peak, and recent_N for sigma (N=10) to account for the heightened seasonality variance. This ensures base stock levels cover the 4-period lead time + review period (1+4=5 weeks).

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime confirmed: P43-P45 average demand is 111 units, following the P42 Black Friday spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition into the new year. Following the Dec holiday peak and Black Friday spike (385 units), demand has moderated but remains relatively high, with recent periods averaging 118 units (P43-P46: 111, 105, 117, 140). The carry-over insights correctly identified a holiday regime; however, we are now entering early January, which historically showed a significant peak in the seed data (Period 1-5 mean was ~143, with spikes near 200). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Looking at in-transit, we have 609 units coming, mostly from orders placed during the high-demand December window. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, making our base stock target the mean demand over the lead time (L+1 periods). To account for the transition from the holiday peak back to a high-volume January (as seen in early 2019 samples), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5, including P42-P46) which averages ~171 units (inflated by Black Friday) or last 4 samples which averages 118. Considering the seed data for Jan/Feb showed mean ~143, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the post-Black Friday baseline (118) which better approximates the start-of-year levels while remaining cautious of holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition (Period 47): Demand in the last 4 weeks (Dec) stabilized to a mean of 118.25 units, significantly lower than the extreme Black Friday spike but consistent with early-year patterns seen in seed data.
