Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 697054014, a women's blouse. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand shows a steady decline from 132 units (Jan 7) to 80 units (Feb 4). Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we must forecast demand for L+1 (5 periods). The latest sample is 80, but since the trend is downward, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the average of the available history while acknowledging the decline. For the lead time, I will use the default promised value of 4 as we have no historical arrival data yet. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand volatility over the 5-period risk horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a steady decline from early January (132) to early February (80). Period 1 actual demand was 117, which is a significant jump from the previous week (80), likely indicating the start of a spring season transition or a new demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (133 units) was placed in Period 1 and has a promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning it won't arrive until Period 5. Demand in Period 1 was 117 units, all lost due to 0 stock. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (the 5 historical samples + Period 1) to capture the trend while acknowledging the recent uptick. Since lead time hasn't been observed yet, I use the 'default' (promised L=4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect actual volatility in this transition period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (seed data + P1, P2) shows: 132, 103, 92, 87, 80, 117, 169. There is a clear upward trend in the last two periods (Period 1 and 2), possibly due to the transition into Spring fashion for this 'Womens Everyday' blouse. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 268 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 (133 units) is expected to arrive during P5. However, since we currently have 0 stock and demand is rising, we must ensure future base stock levels cover the (L+1) window. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand acceleration (avg ~122) while accounting for the higher volatility (range 80-169). L is set to default as we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promised 4-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Despacito 1 Blouse' has shown demand ranging from 80-169 units in the last 8 weeks. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (464 units total), which is consistent with the promised lead time (none expected before P5 conclude). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had back-to-back zero-sales due to lack of stock, it is vital to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand history (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-25) includes samples [132, 103, 92, 87, 80, 117, 169, 150]. There is a visible upward trend in the last 3 periods (117, 169, 150) compared to the preceding 3 (80, 87, 92). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher activity levels (avg ~124.6/week). The OR backend uses (1+L)*mean; for L=4, this covers 5 weeks of demand. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility (std dev) seen in the last few weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's blouse (Womens Everyday Collection). Historical demand from Jan-Feb averaged 98.8 units. Since the simulation started (Feb 11), demand has increased significantly: P1 (117), P2 (169), P3 (150), P4 (157), averaging 148.25 units over the last 4 periods. This represents a regime shift likely tied to spring seasonal demand. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at P6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have reached the 4-period lead time mark yet. To account for the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to project demand for the review+lead time window (1+4=5 periods). Sigma_hat is also adjusted to recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average weekly demand increased from ~99 units (pre-sim) to ~148 units (+49%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: pre-simulation average was ~99 (based on 5 samples provided), while the average for the first 5 periods of the simulation is 137.8 units (117, 169, 150, 157, 96). There was a slight dip in Period 5 (96), but the overall trend since the start of the simulation remains higher than the historical data. The backend OR engine uses (1+L) for its calculations; with L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher post-simulation demand and volatility while ignoring the lower historical baseline. On-hand is low (37), but there are 691 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5), which should start arriving in the coming weeks and satisfy the significant backlog/current demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The single SKU (Womens Blouse) shows a demand shift from an initial average of 99 to a higher level. Looking at the last 6 periods, demand was: 117, 169, 150, 157, 96, 102 (Average = 131.8). However, the last two periods (96, 102) show a significant drop compared to the first four periods of the simulation (117-169). This suggests the initial spike might have been a temporary seasonal burst or early-season stocking effect, and demand is settling into a more moderate range. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data for Period 5 and 6 arrivals confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. With 70 units on-hand and 629 in-transit, we are well-covered for the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current simulation's demand average while acknowledging the recent cooling, and default lead time settings as the 4-period promise is holding steady.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: After an initial spike (P1-P4 avg 148), demand has moderated in P5-P6 (avg 99), returning toward the long-term historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1894.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift: Periods 1-4 averaged 148 units/week, while Periods 5-7 have moderated to an average of 102 units/week (96, 102, 108). This moderation aligns with the pre-simulation average (~99). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse, which typically has steady demand outside of major seasonal shifts. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and actual lead times for orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have consistently arrived in exactly 4 periods (P5, P6, P7). Therefore, L=4 is reliable. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current moderated demand level (avg ~102) over the pipeline (L+1=5 periods). Sigma_hat also uses N=3 to capture current volatility. We have 158 units on-hand and 507 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), totaling 665 units. At a forecast of ~102/week, 665 units cover roughly 6.5 weeks, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time system.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a spike in Periods 1-4 (avg 148) followed by a moderation in Periods 5-7 (avg 102), but Period 8 saw a sharp increase back to 151. This suggests the 'stabilization' noted in Carry-over insights might have been temporary or we are entering a new spring peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). We currently have 192 units on hand and 322 in transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Since the recent demand is volatile (ranging from 96 to 151 in the last 4 weeks), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher-variance environment while reflecting the most recent demand level (avg ~114 over the last 4 periods). This balances the high demand of P8 against the lower P5-P7.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand remains volatile after initial stabilization; Period 8 saw a return to high demand (151 units), suggesting a possible spring seasonal trend for women's blouses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). Demand has been volatile: P1-P4 averaged 148 units, P5-P7 stabilized at ~102 units, P8 spiked to 151 units, and P9 dropped to 98 units. The carry-over insights suggest a spring seasonal trend for women's blouses, which typically sees sustained demand mid-April through May. Given the current on-hand inventory (269) and pipeline (297), we are well-stocked for the immediate next few periods. However, to account for the detected 'spring seasonal trend' and the recent high volatility (StDev ~28 over the last 9 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the full simulation regime, which effectively averages to ~128 units/week. This balances the initial spike with the recent stabilization and the P8 spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the high recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. The product is a women's woven blouse. Inventory is currently high (258 on-hand, 399 in-transit) following a period of moderate demand (Periods 9 and 10 saw 98 and 84 units respectively). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 10 (Period 6 order arrived). Although Period 8 saw a spike (151 units), demand has \u0645\u0646\u0630 moderated. Retail trends for transitional spring clothing (April/May) usually stay stable before summer shifts. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu) with N=6 (Periods 5-10) to capture the stabilization from the initial launch spike, resulting in an average of approximately 106 units/period. For volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the fluctuations seen throughout the simulation. The backend will set the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the initial launch/seasonal spike (P1-P4 avg: 148), demand has entered a lower, stable regime (P5-P10 avg: 106.5).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), we are in a stable demand regime for this women's blouse. After an initial period of high demand (P1-P4 avg: 148), demand for the last 7 periods (P5-P11) has averaged 107.1 units, with periodic fluctuations (e.g., P8 at 151, P11 at 123). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P7). Current on-hand inventory is 209 units, with 325 units in-transit (orders from P9 and P10). Since the pipeline plus on-hand (534) is roughly 5 periods of demand at the current average, and we just had a slight uptick in P11, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-volatile spring regime. This ensures the OR backend uses data from the period after the initial launch noise subsided.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6. The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows an initial spike (P1-P4 avg: 148), followed by a more stable regime (P5-P12 avg: 111). Recent demand (P11: 123, P12: 125) suggests a slight uptick, possibly due to spring/early summer seasonality. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P5-P11 consistently showed arrive_time - order_time = 4). However, in P12, the order from P8 (185 units) did not arrive, and 'In-transit' is 417 (P8: 0, P9: 150, P10: 175, P11: 0, P12: 92. Total = 417). This indicates the order from P8 (which was 0 units anyway) didn't 'arrive', but there were no units to arrive. The pipeline actually consists of P9 (150), P10 (175), and P12 (92). The system is currently holding 84 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using the recent stable-to-slightly-rising mean (approx 115) and standard deviation from the last 8 periods to handle volatility. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-spike behavior.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand has shown some volatility but appears to be in a relatively stable regime post-launch. The last 9 periods (P5-P13) have an average demand of approximately 108.8 units (96, 102, 108, 151, 98, 84, 123, 125, 89), with Period 8 being a notable but isolated outlier. In Period 13, we saw the arrival of the order from Period 9, confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods. However, the order from Period 8 (placed with an order quantity of 0) is effectively missing, and the order from Period 10 is expected to arrive in Period 14. Currently, we have 145 units on-hand and 399 in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the post-spike demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current stable behavior of the SKU while accounting for recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable post-initial spike: P5-P13 average demand is 108.8 units, consistent with the stabilization noted in Period 11.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, we saw a spike in demand during the spring (Feb-Apr), followed by stabilization. Since Period 5, demand has averaged approx. 108.5 units per week (P5-P14). The most recent lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P13 and P14, originating from P9 and P10). Note that the order from Period 8 (0 units) implies no arrival scheduled for Period 12, which explains the zero arrival that period. On-hand inventory is healthy at 216 units, and the pipeline is filled with 301 units. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable post-spike regime (average ~108.5), which is more representative than the full history or the initial launch spike. This ensures we don't over-order based on early seasonal volatility while maintaining enough safety stock for the current stable demand level (Service Level Target ~95% based on profit/holding cost).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a women's blouse. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-11, 13-14). Currently, there is a shipment from Period 12 (92 units) that is 'missing' in terms of conclusion\u2014it should have arrived in Period 16 but hasn't concluded yet (as of the start of P16). However, the in-transit amount of 398 matches the sum of orders from P12 (92), P13 (132), P14 (77), and P15 (97), so nothing is confirmed lost, just potentially delayed within the current period. Demand has remained in a stable post-spike regime since Period 5. The average demand from Period 5 to Period 15 is 108.2 units (std dev ~20). I will use N=11 (P5-P15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable regime and current volatility. The OR backend will see 105 on-hand + 398 in-transit = 503 units of pipeline inventory, which should be sufficient to cover the (L+1) exposure period (~541 units based on mean), resulting in a small adjustment order.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3, 2019 (Period 17), the SKU 697054014 (Women's Blouse) continues to exhibit a stabilized demand regime following the initial February/March spike. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P5-P16), the average weekly demand is approximately 105.5 units. The most recent demand was 64 (Period 16), which is on the lower side, but the 4-week trailing average is approximately 92. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with only Period 8's order (185 units) potentially missing or severely delayed, as orders from Period 9, 10, and 12 have already concluded. Current on-hand inventory is 133, with 415 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (95% service level goal), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the stable post-spike demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 4-period history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for this women's blouse has shown a downward trend over the last month (P14: 104, P15: 111, P16: 64, P17: 55). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 77.8 units, significantly lower than the P5-P13 average of ~109 units. This likely reflects a seasonal drop as the peak spring blouse season transitions into summer. Actual lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 210, with 340 units in transit (ordered in P14, P15, P16, and P17). Given the current low demand regime, the pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to this lower demand signal and avoid excessive inventory accumulation during the summer slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand has entered a lower regime starting around Period 16 (avg 59.5 last two periods compared to P1-P15 avg of 118), suggesting a seasonal summer decline for the blouse category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $953.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Despacito 1 blouse has entered a lower, stable regime as of late May/early June. Period 18 demand (62) is consistent with the recent three-period average (~60 units), confirming a shift away from the earlier average of ~109 units. This likely reflects a seasonal transition in the 'Womens Everyday Collection.' On-hand inventory (225) plus in-transit stock (263) is significantly high given the new demand level (L=4, so coverage for 5 periods @ 60 units/period = 300 units). The order from Period 11 is effectively lost as it is now 7 periods old and does not appear in the concluded arrivals. Lead times for other orders remain stable at 4 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current low-demand summer regime while maintaining 'calculate' for lead time since recent arrivals confirm the promised 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-18 average is 60.3 units, a 45% decrease from the P5-P15 average of 108.8 units, likely seasonal. Shipment from Period 11 is presumed lost (8 periods since order).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse has entered a sustained lower seasonal regime, with the average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) dropping to approximately 55.7 units per period compared to the previous average of ~109. This represents a significant decline as we head into summer. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 280 units) relative to this new demand level. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P12-P15 all arrived with L=4). However, the order from P11 remains missing (9 periods elapsed), which I have flagged as lost to avoid overestimating pipeline inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to align the OR backend with this lower demand regime and prevent excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining the service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand is 55.7 units, a ~50% decrease from the P5-P15 average of 108.8 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the missing Period 11 shipment.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for the 'Blouse in woven fabric' has entered a significant summer seasonal decline. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 50.6 units (64, 55, 62, 42, 30), which is a sharp drop from the previous stable regime of ~109 units (P5-P15). The most recent period (P20) saw only 30 units of demand, suggesting a continuing downward trend or a new low plateau. With on-hand inventory at 359 units and in-transit at 57 units (the P17 order), the total pipeline is 416 units. This is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) even at the former higher demand levels, let alone the current low regime. To prevent excessive holding costs during this summer lull, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility. Lead time remains established at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Summer seasonal decline confirmed. Demand average for P16-P20 is 50.6 units, compared to P5-P15 average of 108.8 units. The order from Period 11 is officially confirmed as lost (10 periods since ordering).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the 'Blouse in woven fabric' is in a sustained summer seasonal decline. Average demand from Period 16 to Period 21 has dropped to 48.6 units per week, compared to the spring average of ~109 units. Currently, there are 377 units on-hand with zero units in-transit (all previous orders have either arrived or been confirmed lost/exhausted). Given the current demand regime (~50 units/week), the current on-hand inventory covers approximately 7.5 weeks of demand, which is significantly more than the (L+1) = 5 weeks required to cover lead time plus the review period. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering the start of the summer regime in Period 16) to ensure the OR backend reflects this lower demand environment. This will help prevent unnecessary ordering while the high on-hand inventory gradually depletes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we continue to observe the established 'Summer Seasonal Decline' for the women's blouse SKU. Recent demand (P16-P22) has averaged 46.4 units per period, which is significantly lower than the P5-P15 average of 108.8. Current on-hand inventory is 344 units, and there are no units in-transit (partially due to the confirmed loss of the P11 order and the completion of all other expected arrivals). Given the promised lead time (L=4) and a review cycle of 1, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the current average of ~46.4 units, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 232 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (344) already exceeds this requirement and the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect this lower seasonal demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the current overstock situation, resulting in zero units ordered this period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime as expected for the summer season. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is 45.3 units, significantly lower than the P5-P15 average of 108.8 units. The most recent 4 periods (P20-P23) show an even lower average of 34.8 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 307 units with zero in-transit shipments (pipeline is clear). The shipment from P11 is confirmed lost. Since current on-hand inventory (307) far exceeds the total expected demand over the lead time plus review period (target base stock for 5 periods based on recent demand would be ~175-250 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders while we burn through existing stock. I'll use N=8 to capture the full summer decline regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime persistent: Period 16-23 average demand is 45.3 units, approximately 42% of the spring average.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054014' (Womens Blouse) is currently in a sustained low-demand summer regime. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 44.7 units per week, which is a significant drop from the spring average of ~109 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 267 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current average demand of ~45 units and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (Promised L=4), the required base stock is approximately 225 units plus a safety buffer. Since current on-hand inventory (267) exceeds this requirement and demand remains low and stable, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 (the length of the current summer regime starting at Period 16) to reflect this lower demand accurately to the OR backend and prevent over-ordering while we deplete existing stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for this blouse (SKU 697054014) has remained in a low-demand summer regime since Period 16 (mid-May). The demand average from Period 16 to Period 25 is approximately 44.6 units per period, which is a significant drop compared to the spring average of ~109 units. This persistent low demand suggests a seasonal trough for woven long-sleeve blouses. On-hand inventory is 228 units, which is quite high relative to the current weekly demand (covering roughly 5 periods). There are only 3 units in-transit (ordered Period 25). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (excluding the lost Period 11 shipment). Given the high on-hand stock and the stable but low demand regime, I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this summer regime accurately, ensuring the OR engine does not over-order while we bleed off excess inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'Blouse in woven fabric' remains in a seasonal low, although Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 63 units from the previous average of ~38 units. Analysis of the period 16-26 regime shows an average demand of 45.8 units. The order from Period 11 (2019/4/22) is confirmed lost, and recent Lead Time has stabilized at 4 periods. With 165 units on hand and 37 in-transit (total pipeline of 202), and an estimated lead time demand (L+1=5) of approximately 230-250 units, current inventory is slightly lean if demand begins to recover for late summer/early fall. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (the low-demand regime starting Period 16) to capture the current state while allowing for the recent slight increase in volatility. L remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Women's Blouse) is exiting its summer seasonal low-demand regime. Demand has significantly increased over the last two periods, rising from a summer average of approximately 40 units to 63 units in P26 and 96 units in P27 (August transition). This aligns with a 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Fall' uptick in the garment industry. We are shifting parameters to capture this upward momentum. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to overweight these recent higher demand signals (avg 66/week) while discarding the dead summer lows. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P17 arrived on P21). The on-hand inventory is currently low (69 units) relative to the rising demand, so we need to ensure the order pipeline (104 units) and new orders sufficiently cover the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-summer recovery began in Period 26. Average demand for P26-P27 is 79.5 units, compared to the P16-P25 summer average of 43.6 units, marking an 80% increase as the season transitions to fall.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). As noted in the Period 28 carry-over, demand is recovering from a summer low (avg ~44 units, P16-P25) into a fall regime. Demand in P26-P28 was 63, 96, and 69 (avg ~76). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 218 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals consistently reflect this (with the exception of one lost order from P11). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period recovery average to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock for the upward seasonal trend. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the recent variability of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery trend sustained: Period 26-28 average demand is 76.0 units, up from the 43.6 unit summer average (+74%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blouse SKU has entered a clear fall recovery regime starting at Period 26 (Sept/Oct transition). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 76.0 units, compared to the summer low (P16-P25) of 43.6 units. This is a sustained ~74% increase. In Period 29, we experienced a stockout (sold 3 units against 76 demand) due to on-hand inventory being depleted and only a small order from Period 25 arriving. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (the P25 order arrived on time in P29). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new, higher-demand fall regime while setting the lead time (L) to the stable calculate method. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current recovery trend and replenish the empty on-hand stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054014' (Women's Blouse) is clearly in a post-summer recovery/fall demand regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has been: 63, 96, 69, 76, 103, averaging 81.4 units. This is a significant increase from the summer average of 43.6 units (+87%). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand spike exceeding recent small arrivals. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have stockouts (ending on-hand=0), I will use the last 5 periods (the recovery phase) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets the higher fall demand level rather than the lower summer average. I set N=5 for both to capture the specific variance and mean of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P26-P30 is 81.4 units, representing a sustained ~87% increase over the summer low-demand regime (P16-P25 avg: 43.6).

The most recent demand (P31) was 132, matching the spring peak. Lead times have stabilized at 4 periods (P29, P30, and P31 arrivals all confirmed L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the rapid demand increase, leading to lost sales. We must set parameters to account for the current higher demand level and ensure the incoming pipeline (404 units) is supplemented to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I choose N=6 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the fall recovery regime (P26-P31).

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery regime strong: P26-P31 average demand is 89.8 units, significantly higher than the P16-P25 summer average of 43.6 units (+106%). Demand is trending upward with P31 hitting 132.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak fall demand season, with Period 32 demand at 125 units and Period 31 at 132 units. The fall recovery regime (starting P26) is strong, showing an average of 93.4 units over the last 7 periods, significantly up from the summer low. Inventory is currently struggling to keep pace, with on-hand reaching zero for five consecutive periods due to the rapid demand increase. Although the promised lead time is 4, recent arrivals (P29-P32) have consistently confirmed actual lead time at 4 periods. Given the upward trend and high recent demand (avg 120 last 3 periods), mu_hat is set to reflect this recent high-velocity demand. sigma_hat is also increased to account for the volatility seen during this recovery spike. This strategy aims to build safety stock to stop the current stockout streak and capture the full sales potential of the fall season.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak confirmed: Average demand for P30-P32 is 120 units, reflecting a full recovery to spring levels and a potential peak for the blouse category. Stockouts have occurred for 5 consecutive periods (P28-P32) because of this rapid demand acceleration.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand fall peak. Demand in Period 33 reached 184 units, significantly exceeding the previous fall recovery average (~90 units) and outstripping available supply. The system has experienced stockouts for six consecutive periods (P28-P33), indicating that current lead-time demand estimates are too conservative for this acceleration. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend (103 -> 132 -> 125 -> 184), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this 'Fall Peak' regime (avg ~147 per week). Pipeline inventory is 458, which is slightly below the required 5-period coverage (L+1) at this new demand level (147 * 5 = 735). The OR backend must place aggressive orders to reconcile the gap between current in-transit units and the peak demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter peak confirmed: Demand has accelerated rapidly from Period 30 (103) to Period 33 (184), with an average of 147 units over the last 3 periods, surpassing the initial spring peak levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime. While Period 34 demand (119) was lower than Period 33 (184), the average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 133 units, which is a significant increase from the summer low. We have experienced stockouts for 7 consecutive periods (P28-P34) due to this demand surge. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 559 units, which includes orders from P31 (85), P32 (133), P33 (140), and P34 (201). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockout and meet the sustained high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility. This should signal the OR backend to place a larger order to cover the (L+1) period demand and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: High-demand Fall/Winter regime confirmed. Average demand for P30-P34 is 133 units. Stockouts have persisted for 7 periods (P28-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime following a summer low. While Period 34 and 35 saw demand of 119 and 99 units (down from the P33 peak of 184), stockouts have persisted for 8 periods (P28-35), meaning actual latent demand is likely constrained by availability. The pipeline contains 658 units, including orders from P32 (133), P33 (140), P34 (201), and P35 (184). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product is a long-sleeved woven blouse, we are in the peak seasonal window for October. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P30-P35) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~127), and sigma_hat likewise to account for the high volatility observed during this recovery and peak (std ~32). This will maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout streak as soon as the P32-P34 pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Sustained stockout period (P28-P35) due to rapid Fall recovery. Observed demand (P30-P35 avg: 127) likely underestimates true demand due to inventory depletion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter peak for this blouse SKU. The last period (P36) showed a demand of 177, and we have experienced zero ending inventory for the last 9 periods (P28-P36), meaning true demand is likely higher than recorded 'sold' units. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 134 units, including a peak of 184 in P33. To address the persistent stockouts and catch up with the seasonal demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7). This yields a base stock calculation centered around the recent high-demand regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4, as recent arrivals (P32 order arriving in P36) confirm the 4-period lead time is stable. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window (N=7) to capture the increased volatility of the fall peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter demand peak sustained: Period 30-36 average demand is 134.1 units, successfully rebounding from summer lows (~44 units). Consistent stockouts since P28 indicate true demand exceeds supply.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime following a summer low. Period 37 concluded with 135 units of demand, and the average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is approximately 134.6 units. Significant stockouts occurred between P28 and P36, indicating that the 'observed' demand in those periods likely underestimates true demand. The inventory position has finally stabilized with 5 units on-hand and 655 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this high-demand regime (P30-P37). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are recovering from a prolonged stockout and demand is volatile during seasonal shifts, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock reflects the most recent variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Womens Blouse) is currently in a sustained high-demand Fall/Winter regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged 135.5 units despite frequent stockouts between P28-P36 which likely masked true demand. The most recent three periods (P36-P38) show demand of 177, 135, and 127 (average 146). Inventory has finally stabilized with an on-hand balance of 79 after large arrivals from P33-P34 orders. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should target a high service level. To capture this high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility and potential unobserved demand during stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (P30-P38) to represent the Fall recovery/peak average, and sigma_hat using the same window to ensure the safety stock covers the high variance observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter high-demand regime peak: Average demand for P30-P38 is 135.5 units, representing the established seasonal plateau. Stockout period (P28-P36) resolved with arrivals in P37-P38.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime (P30-P39 avg: 132.8 units). Although recent demand (P37-P39) has moderated slightly (135, 127, 108), historic patterns for women's blouses often show a peak in mid-November linked to holiday shopping. Current on-hand inventory (155) and high in-transit (513) are now better aligned with demand after a long stockout period (P28-P36). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand Fall regime while allowing the OR backend to account for the actual variance observed during this period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Womens Blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime following a deep summer low. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) with an average of 114 units, showing a slight cooling from the peak seen in P33 (184). The stockout period (P28-P36) has been resolved, and on-hand inventory is now healthy at 155 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the approach of the late November/December retail period, demand is expected to remain firm or potentially increase due to holiday shopping. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized high-demand level (avg ~114 units per week, leading to a total base stock requirement covering P + L = 5 periods). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the current regime's volatility, which is lower than the transition phase but higher than the summer floor.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter demand stabilized at a high level: Period 36-40 average demand is 114.0 units, significantly higher than the summer average but lower than the absolute peak in P33.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054014' is currently in Period 42 (late November). Demand has stabilized following the fall recovery, with the most recent 5-period (P37-P41) average at 106.4 units. We are seeing a gradual cooling from the P33 peak (184 units), which is expected as we move past the main fall season for blouses. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 263 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 423 units (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). To avoid overstocking as we approach year-end, I am setting mu_hat to be based on the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P34-P41), which captures the stabilization at a mean of ~114 units. This will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 570 units (5 periods * 114), which is well-supported by current on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand stabilization confirmed post-fall peak. Period 37-41 average demand is 106.4 units, trending slightly downward from the high-demand October regime (P33-P37 avg: 142.8).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054014 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a high-demand Fall/Winter regime following a deep summer low. A significant demand spike (178 units) occurred in Period 42 (Nov 25), likely associated with Black Friday/pre-holiday shopping. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. While the Period 42 spike is high, the overall average for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 115 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this current late-year volatility and level, ensuring the base stock accounts for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased variance seen in the last few weeks (ranging from 72 to 178). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods excluding the lost shipment in P11.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike: P42 (late Nov) saw demand reach 178 units, a 56% increase over the P37-P41 average, likely due to seasonal holiday promotions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the holiday season (mid-December). Demand in Period 42 spiked to 178 (late Nov bonus/sale), then normalized to 93 in Period 43. Given the products are blouses (women's everyday collection), we expect elevated but volatile demand through December. Currently, on-hand inventory is 235 and pipeline is 374. Total inventory is 609. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. The average demand for the 'Fall/Winter' period (excluding the P42 spike) is approximately 110-120 units. Since P42 was an outlier and P43 was lower, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (covering the stabilization post-October peak and the holiday spike) to capture current seasonal levels. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle the recent volatility from P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand fluctuation: P42 spike (178) followed by P43 normalization (93) suggests high volatility during the late Nov/Dec period. Seasonality remains in a high-demand regime compared to summer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1992.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering the peak of the holiday shopping season (mid-December). Recent demand has been volatile but generally elevated: Period 42 saw a spike of 178 units, followed by 93 and 116 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 109.8 units. Given the seasonal context for a 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse, we expect sustained demand through the end of the year. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is healthy at 212 units, with 433 units in-transit. To ensure we capture remaining holiday demand and potential post-holiday sales while managing endgame risk (Period 45 of 47), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime (+/-(110 * 5) = 550 units target inventory). This will maintain a high service level while the OR cap prevents excessive over-ordering as the simulation nears its end.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov to Dec): Demand average for P42-P44 is 129 units, confirming a high-demand period compared to the Oct-Nov stabilization average (~106 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1661.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), entering the final two weeks of the simulation. Historical data and seasonal knowledge of the 'Women's Blouse' category suggest that demand remains in a high-demand regime throughout December, though potentially volatile due to holiday peaks and post-holiday normalization. The average demand for the last four weeks (P42-P45) is 121.25 units. Since we are at the very end of the simulation (Period 46 of 47), and the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive before the simulation concludes. The primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (201 units) and the expected incoming arrival from Period 42 (12 units) to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. The OR backend needs to reflect the current high-demand context even if the order won't arrive, as the logic still governs the safety stock calculations. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the holiday regime (P41-P45 avg: 111.4), which provides a stable yet high base for mu_hat. L remains at the promised 4 periods as consistent arrival patterns (except for the lost P11 shipment) confirm this lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has been 178, 93, 116, 98, and 93, averaging 115.6 units. This indicates that while the late November spike (P42) was significant, demand has settled into a holiday/winter regime of ~100 units per week. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 120 and 493 units in-transit (orders from P43-P46), we are well-covered for the coming weeks. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-spike holiday average (115.6 * 5 = 578). For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the volatility of the recent period including the spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand stabilization. After the late Nov spike (P42), demand from P43-P46 has averaged 100 units, returning to the high-demand Fall/Winter baseline.
