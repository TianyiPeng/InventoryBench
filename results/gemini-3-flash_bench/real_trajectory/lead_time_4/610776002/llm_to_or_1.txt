Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt). Inventory is currently zero. Demand history shows an upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. The average demand is 204.8, but the most recent sample (308) reflects a significant 50% increase over the mean, suggesting either a seasonal ramp-up or a regime shift. Given the product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, we are likely entering the spring/summer season. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no lead-time history yet, I will use the default promised L. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent growth trend (avg of last 3: 233.7) while smoothing the volatility. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture a broader view of volatility across the current available history, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer given the lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) shows a clear upward trend based on pre-game and Period 1 demand: samples are [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266]. The mean of the last 3 samples is approximately 269, showing significantly higher volume than the initial 148-160 range. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we lost 266 units of sales in Period 1 due to stockout. A shipment of 343 is in-transit (ordered P1), which is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets the current demand regime (+/- 260-300 units/week). The OR backend will calculate base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the stockout and the rising trend, capturing recent variance is critical to avoid further lost sales once stock arrives.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 with a promised lead time of 4 periods. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Observed demand in the last 7 weeks has been steadily increasing: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-game history), and 266, 316 (Periods 1 and 2). This trend coincides with the transition from February into Spring, suggesting a seasonal demand ramp-up. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) is not expected until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Total in-transit (674) covers orders from P1 and P2. To account for the clear upward trajectory in demand, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (308, 266, 316). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility in this growth phase. L remains at the promised value of 4 as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current demand (Periods 1-3) is averaging 296 units per period, which is higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg ~205). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory because the initial orders haven't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (N=1) with L=4 will arrive during Period 5 (N+L) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). We have 1015 units in transit (343+331+341), which aligns with orders from Periods 1-3. Given the consistent higher demand in the first three periods of gameplay compared to historicals, I will use recent_N (N=3) to estimate the demand mean and standard deviation to ensure the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current 'Everyday Basics' run rate. Lead time is set to default as we haven't reached the first delivery window yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's basic T-shirt. On-hand inventory is 0, with 1,355 units in-transit. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed P1) should arrive DURING Period 5 and will be visible in the P5 conclude message (ready for P6 decision). Demand has been consistently higher than the historical samples (266, 316, 306, 283 vs. original samples of 148 to 308). The mean demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 293. Since sales have been 0 due to 0 stock, we must ensure our base stock covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (total 5 periods). I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture this higher regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 148-233 in January, spiking to 308 in early February. Since the game started (Periods 1-5), demand has averaged 284.6 units per week (266, 316, 306, 283, 252). The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5. Currently, we have 91 on-hand and 1204 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since we are entering the spring season for a 'lightweight jersey' t-shirt, demand is likely to remain stable or slightly increase. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the average demand of the last 5 game periods (avg ~285) rather than the lower January pre-game samples. The backend will then target (1+L) * 285 = 1425 units for the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand stabilized around 285 units/week during February/March.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item. Demand samples (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270) show a recent Mean of ~282 units/week over the last 6 weeks, confirming a stable demand regime for this 'Everyday Basic' item as it transitions from late winter into early spring. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 152 with 1,100 in-transit. Pipeline inventory (1,100) and current on-hand (152) are high because we are still receiving the large initial orders from P3 and P4 to cover the backlog/zero-inventory start. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand (avg ~285) while ensuring the OR backend's service level logic (based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) maintains sufficient stock for the next (L+1)=5 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product is a women's everyday jersey t-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand in Period 7 saw a spike to 364 units, which may signal a shift as we enter April (spring seasonality for t-shirts). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is 295.3, while the overall average since Period 1 is 293.8. Although the P7 spike is notable, I will use a slightly more responsive recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent range (252 to 364). With L=4, the OR backend targets a base stock covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. On-hand is 129 and in-transit is 1030 (total pipeline 1159), which roughly covers 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The parameters are set to ensure sufficient stock for the spring upturn while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in P7 (364 units) vs previous average (~285), potentially indicating early spring seasonality for lightweight jersey tops.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is seasonally relevant as we enter the spring/summer period. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift starting around Period 7 (March 25th). Demand was ~285 units in Periods 1-6 but has increased to 364 and 372 in the last two periods (+30% increase). I am defining a new demand regime starting at Period 7. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order in P5, P2 in P6, etc.), matching the promised lead time. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. I will estimate mu_hat using the recent N=2 periods (avg 368) to capture the seasonal ramp-up, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock around (1+4)*368 = 1840 plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 7 (late March): average demand increased from ~285 to ~368 (+29%) as spring seasonality for lightweight jersey tops begins.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is highly seasonal as we move into spring (April). Historical demand since Period 7 (March 25th) has shown a step-change: P7 (364), P8 (372), and P9 (271). While P9 saw a dip to 271, the overall average of the last 3 periods is ~336, compared to the February average of ~285. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (arriving in Period N+4, visible in N+5), which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently critical at 18 units on-hand, though 1,243 units are in-transit (reflecting previous high orders). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift in both mean demand and the increased volatility observed in the spring transition. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4655.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, seeing increased demand as we move into late April (Spring). Historical demand shifted significantly starting Period 7 (March 25), with the last four periods (P7-P10) averaging 329.25 units, up from the initial ~285. In Period 10, demand was 310, and we experienced a stockout (sold only 245 units due to 0 ending inventory), indicating our current safety stock levels are too low for this higher demand regime. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and Capture the seasonality, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent demand increase (+15% over the full sample mean). I will also use N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility observed in this spring regime. On-hand is currently 0, but 1445 units are in-transit, which covers (~1445 / 329) \u2248 4.4 periods of demand, aligning well with the (L+1)=5 period coverage goal.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 10 (demand 310, sold 245) due to demand regime shift and insufficient on-hand inventory. Demand for periods 7-10 averages ~329 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a significant demand surge as spring peaks. Demand in Period 11 spiked to 564 units, far exceeding the previous average of ~330. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand inventory) and have lost sales for two consecutive periods. The demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has been 364, 372, 271, 310, and 564, averaging ~376 units. However, the last period's jump to 564 suggests a new, higher regime or a seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the spring shift, and setting sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the recent volatility (271 to 564). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in Period 11 (late April): demand spiked to 564 units. The average demand for the spring season (P7-P11) has risen to ~376 units, with significantly increased volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is experiencing a significant spring/summer seasonal demand surge. Recent demand samples show a major shift: P11 (564) and P12 (424), compared to the earlier baseline of ~300. Demand has exceeded current on-hand inventory for three consecutive periods (P10, P11, P12), resulting in stockouts. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with 1745 in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have entered a higher-demand regime with increased volatility (standard deviation is rising), I will focus on the most recent 6 samples (P7-P12) to capture the seasonal uptrend. This provides an average demand of ~384 per period. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to account for both the increased mean and the higher volatility seen in the spring transition, aiming to recover from the stockout state once the large pipeline (1745 units) begins arriving.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed: mean demand increased to ~384 for periods 7-12, with significantly higher volatility (P11 spike to 564). Sustained stockouts occurred P10-P12 due to this surge.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand shift as we move deeper into May. Demand from Period 7 to Period 13 has averaged 374 units, significantly higher than the February/March baseline of 285. Although Period 13 saw a slight dip to 304, Period 11 (564) and Period 12 (424) demonstrate high volatility and substantial upside risk, leading to stockouts in periods 10-12. To recover from these stockouts and protect against the current high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat focusing on the last 7 periods (P7-P13) to capture the spring seasonality shift. The lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages which consistently show a 4-period duration.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are in the middle of a high-demand spring/early summer season for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 7, the demand has shifted significantly upwards. Demand samples for the spring regime (P7-P14) are: 364, 372, 271, 310, 564, 424, 304, 431. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 380 units/period, with high volatility observed (notably the 564 unit spike in Period 11). Although we have seen stockouts from P10-P12, on-hand inventory has recently recovered to 72 units with a substantial pipeline of 1724 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture the current spring demand level and volatility while adjusting the lead time parameter to the confirmed 'default' of 4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the higher spring rate (~1900 units total system inventory target).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for P7-P14 averages ~380 units/period, showing high variance (std ~88) compared to the Feb/Mar baseline of ~285.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. The item is a 'lightweight jersey t-shirt'. Since Period 7 (late March), demand has shifted into a spring regime with significantly higher mean and volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P7-P15), the demand has averaged approximately 387 units, but this includes a significant peak of 564 in P11 and recent high demand (P14: 431, P15: 442). The on-hand inventory is extremely low (7 units) following several periods of near-stockouts or actual stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given we are in late May, demand for lightweight t-shirts is likely to remain high or increase further as summer approaches. To maintain high service levels (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will base mu_hat on the recent high-demand regime (N=9) to capture the current spring trend, and use the recent volatility (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased uncertainty observed since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: In late May, demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts remains elevated following the spring shift identified in Period 7; average demand for P7-P15 is ~387 units with sustained volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, and the product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Since Period 7 (late March), demand has shifted into a higher spring/summer regime. For the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the mean demand is 392 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~285. In the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 407.2 units, indicating sustained high demand as summer begins. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the elevated spring/summer regime while maintaining enough sample stability to handle the high variance observed (e.g., the P11 spike of 564). This covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility of this seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P7-P16): average demand is ~392 units/period, significantly higher than the Feb/Mar baseline of ~285 (+37.5%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during the summer months. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 7 (late March), with demand further accelerating in recent weeks. Period 17 saw a peak demand of 640 units, significantly above the previous 'spring' average of ~390 units. This suggests the summer peak is currently active. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at only 47 units and a high demand environment, we must set parameters that allow for higher base stock to prevent further stockouts. I will use the last 11 samples (P7-P17) to capture the elevated seasonal demand regime while acknowledging the recent spike to 640 units. Using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate the mean (~435) and standard deviation (~102) of this higher-demand period, which when multiplied by (1+L=5) for mu_hat and sqrt(5) for sigma_hat, will provide a robust target stock level for the OR backend to aim for.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed in Period 17: demand reached 640 units. The demand regime from P7 to P17 now averages ~435 units/period, roughly a 50% increase from the February/March baseline (~285).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer season. The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand has shifted significantly upwards since Period 7 (late March), with a recent spike to 640 units in Period 17 and 419 units (truncated by stockout) in Period 18. The average demand from Period 7 to 18 is approximately 409 units, but looking specifically at the most recent regime (P11-P18), the average is closer to 442 units per period with very high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing recurring stockouts due to underestimating the summer peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent with observed arrivals. Given the recent stockout in Period 18 and the high demand of 640 in Period 17, I will use a 7-period lookback (N=7) to capture the high-demand summer regime while smoothing out the extreme P17 peak. This targets a mu_hat of approx 2200-2300 (5 periods * ~440-460) to ensure we cover the lead time plus current period while accounting for high summer seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand from P11 to P18 significantly elevated, averaging ~440 units, with a peak of 640. Consistent stockouts (P10-P12, P18) indicate inventory targets must stay high throughout June/July.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, representing the summer peak for lightweight jersey t-shirts. Demand has significantly shifted since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 451 units per period from P11 to P19 (recent 9 samples). The peak observed in Period 17 (640 units) and the stockout in Period 18 indicate that high service levels are necessary as we are in the middle of summer. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture high summer demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire high-demand summer regime starting from the spike at Period 11. This captures the current mean (~451) and the high volatility (std ~94) seen during this period, allowing the OR backend to set a robust base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P11-P19) averages ~451 units/period, with high volatility (std ~94) and peak demand of 640.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in its peak summer demand regime. Historical demand from Period 11 to Period 20 shows a clear upward shift compared to the spring, with an average demand of approximately 426 units and a standard deviation of about 101. The peak demand reached 640 in Period 17, and stockouts occurred recently in Period 18. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (P16 order arrived in P20). Given the high volatility and the seasonal peak, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture this summer regime (P11-P20). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the recent high variance, ensuring sufficient service levels during the high-demand summer months.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P11-P20) for lightweight jersey t-shirts averages ~426 units/period with high volatility (std ~101). Peak demand observed at 640 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting peak summer for the lightweight jersey t-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P20-P21) has shown a cooling trend (301 and 232 units) compared to the mid-June peak (640 units), suggesting we may be moving past the absolute peak of summer demand. However, the 'Summer regime' average remains high (~426 units). I will use recent_N (N=11, covering P11-P21) for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer demand level while acknowledging the recent high volatility. This N-value covers the core summer surge. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by P17 order arriving P21). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=11) to account for the significantly increased variance observed during this summer period compared to the spring/winter baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially cooling after early-June peak (P20-P21 avg ~267 vs summer avg ~426), but high volatility continues.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for this 'lightweight jersey t-shirt' showed a significant spring/summer surge starting around Period 7 (late March) and peaking in Period 17 (early June) with 640 units. However, recent demand (P20-P22) has cooled significantly, averaging ~257 units/period (301, 232, 238). This suggests the peak summer demand phase has passed, transitioning into a late-summer stabilization or decline. On-hand inventory is healthy (744) and pipeline inventory (1548) is very high due to aggressive ordering during the peak. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (~257 units/period) while maintaining the promised lead time (L=4). Calculating mu_hat over (1+L) periods with this new mean suggests a value around 1285 (5 * 257). Given the high pipeline and on-hand inventory, the OR backend will naturally scale back orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand for P20-P22 (late June to mid July) dropped to ~257 units/period from the early-summer peak average of ~450 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (SKU 610776002) is in a clear cooling phase as the peak summer season (June/July) winds down. Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 301, 232, 238, and 212, averaging approximately 245 units\u2014a significant drop from the earlier summer peak of ~450. We are currently holding a substantial on-hand inventory of 1,138 units, with another 942 units in transit (ordered in P20-P22). With an estimated lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covered for $(1+L) = 5$ periods of demand. Given current demand levels, our total inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) of 2,080 units covers over 8 weeks of sales at the current rate (~245 units/week). To avoid excessive holding costs as the season likely continues to transition toward late summer/autumn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified: Average demand for P20-P23 (late June to late July) is ~246 units, down from the June peak of ~450. Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new demand rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2496.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has clearly entered a cooling phase following the summer peak in June. Demand from Period 21 to Period 24 has been consistently lower, averaging approximately 222 units (232, 238, 212, 207), which is a significant drop from the June peak levels of ~450. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1437 units, which is approximately 6.5 times the current weekly demand. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover L+1 periods, the required base stock is approximately 1110 units (222 * 5). Since on-hand (1437) plus in-transit (436) far exceeds this requirement, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) to reflect this lower demand regime and allow inventory to bleed down, avoiding excessive holding costs. L is set to calculate as the lead time has been stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase stabilized: Average demand for Period 21-24 (July) is ~222 units, down from the June peak avg of ~450 units (-50%). Inventory levels are currently excessive relative to this new post-summer demand rate.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has entered a significant cooling phase as we move into August (late summer/pre-fall). Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged approximately 209 units per period, a sharp decline from the June peak averages of ~450. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,533 units, which already covers more than 7 periods of current demand. With an additional 186 units in transit (ordered in P22), our pipeline is more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking, while maintaining the lead time at the stable observed value of 4. The goal is to aggressively burn down existing inventory to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase confirmed: Demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts in July/early August (P21-P25) has stabilized at a lower average of ~209 units/period, down over 50% from the June peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (lightweight jersey t-shirt) is in a significant post-summer cooling phase. Demand has dropped consistently from a June peak of ~450 units to a late July/August average of ~150 units, with the most recent demand hitting a low of 102 units in Period 26. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1617 units, which is enough to cover over 10 periods of demand at the current rate (1617 / ~150). With a lead time of 4 periods and a high holding cost relative to the cooling demand, the priority is to avoid further accumulation and let the existing stock deplete. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering Periods 21-26) to reflect this lower, stabilized demand regime and use 'calculate' for lead time as deliveries have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase stabilized: Demand for Periods 21-26 (July-early August) has averaged ~191 units, showing a steady decline to 102 units in Period 26. Inventory is currently sufficient for the remainder of the season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-summer/early-fall cooling phase. From Period 21 to Period 27 (July to mid-August), the average demand has dropped to approximately 181 units/period, with the most recent week at 120 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1497 units, which is enough to cover more than 10 periods of demand at the current average rate (181 * 10 = 1810). There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost relative to the decreasing demand and the massive inventory surplus, the goal is to avoid any further ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the cooled demand regime (P21-P27), which will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory, ensuring the OR backend places zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase stabilized: Demand for Periods 21-27 (July-August) has averaged ~181 units, significantly lower than the June peak of ~450 units. Significant inventory surplus exists.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current data from August (Periods 25-28) shows demand has firmly settled into a late-season cooling phase, with recent demand figures of 154, 102, 120, and 158 units. The average demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 133.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 1339 units, with 0 units in-transit. Given that the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory covers roughly 10 weeks of current demand (1339 / 133.5), we have a massive surplus relative to the rest of the season. No new orders are needed. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime and use default lead time, allowing the OR backend to see that the base stock target is significantly below current on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase has fully stabilized: Demand for Periods 21-28 (July-August) has averaged ~159 units, with the most recent 4 weeks averaging 133 units. Massive inventory surplus (1339 units) exists relative to end-of-season demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring/summer peak followed by a significant cooling phase starting in July (around Period 21). The demand has stabilized at a much lower level, with the last 9 periods (P21-P29) averaging approximately 174 units, and the last 4 periods (P26-P29) averaging 130 units. We currently have a massive inventory surplus of 1199 units on-hand with zero in-transit. This stock is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the season, even if demand remains at the current 'cooled' levels. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and to stop the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders, I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the post-peak demand regime (mean ~174) and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect the decreased volatility. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than our current on-hand inventory, effectively halting new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts in August (P25-P29) has stabilized at a low average of ~135 units/period. Huge inventory surplus (1199 units) exists at start of September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered a low-volume, stable phase characteristic of the post-summer/early autumn transition. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged approximately 136.5 units per period (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145). The massive on-hand inventory of 1054 units is currently more than sufficient to cover demand for the next 7-8 periods at this rate, far exceeding the requirement for the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (L+1=5). No new orders have been placed since Period 22, and no orders are currently in transit. The primary focus is now on depleting the existing surplus to minimize holding costs, which are $1.0/unit/period. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods reflects this stabilized, lower demand regime, which will prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary new orders while inventory remains high.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is currently experiencing its end-of-summer demand decline as we move into mid-September (Period 32). Historical demand from Period 29-31 shows a steady stabilization at approximately 142 units per period (140, 145, 141). The current on-hand inventory is 913 units, which is extremely high (covering over 6 periods of current demand) with zero units in-transit. Given the high on-hand stock and the seasonal nature of the product, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the stable, low-demand regime of late August/early September (~140 units), ensuring the base stock calculation remains significantly below current inventory levels to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season stabilization confirmed: Demand for Period 29-31 (late August/early September) has stabilized at a low average of ~142 units/period, down from the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019 (Period 33). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is fundamentally seasonal and is currently in an end-of-season/autumn phase. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the summer peak, with the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging approximately 144 units. The starting on-hand inventory for Period 33 is 778 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current average demand and the remaining 14 periods in the game, the existing 778 units of inventory are sufficient to cover over 5 periods of demand (778 / 144 \u2248 5.4 periods). Since the lead time is 4 periods and we have a massive surplus relative to holding costs, there is no need to place new orders. I am setting parameters to reflect the low-demand regime (using recent_N=5 for P28-P32) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains below the current inventory level, effectively preventing any new replenishment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (lightweight jersey t-shirt) is in a stable end-of-season demand regime. Observation of the last five periods (P29-P33) shows demand has stabilized at a low average of approximately 142 units per period (140, 145, 141, 135, 147). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 631 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate of ~142 units/period, the total requirement is approximately 710 units (5 * 142). Since on-hand inventory (631) is close to this requirement and holding costs apply, maintaining a conservative replenishment strategy is appropriate to avoid excess terminal inventory as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this late-season stabilization accurately.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts has stabilized at approximately 142 units/period (P29-P33 average).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. We are in the end-of-season for a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Historical data from late August through September (P29-P34) shows demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging 135.6 units/period (P29: 140, P30: 145, P31: 141, P32: 135, P33: 147, P34: 106). On-hand inventory is 525 units with 95 units in-transit (ordered P34), totaling 620 units of pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~136 units, required stock is approximately 680 units. Our current pipeline (620) is slightly below this, but given the seasonal decline, we want to avoid over-ordering as we approach the game end (Period 47). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stable end-of-season demand regime, and L to default as arrival reliability has been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts (P29-P34) has stabilized at a low average of ~136 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October, and the product (lightweight jersey t-shirt) is deep in the end-of-season cooling phase. Demand has trended downwards from the summer peak, averaging approximately 136 units/period between P29-P34, but the most recent two periods (P34-P35) show a further dip to 106 and 85 units respectively. On-hand inventory is 440 units, which is high compared to current weekly demand, but with a 4-period lead time, we must consider demand coverage for the final 11 periods of the game (up to P47). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy; to prevent unnecessary holding costs given the massive surplus that was just cleared, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P29-P35) where demand stabilized, which averages ~122 units/period. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on historical summer peaks while maintaining enough stock for the slow end-of-season tail. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the lower volatility of this stable period.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand further cooled in October (P34-P35 avg ~95 units), continuing the stabilization observed since late August (P29-P35 avg ~122 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The SKU is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is fundamentally a spring/summer item currently in its end-of-season/autumn phase. Following a massive stock surplus in late summer, demand has stabilized at a much lower level. During the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 91.6 units (106, 85, 84). The overall trend since late August (P29-P36) reflects an average of ~120 units, but the most recent two weeks suggest a further cooling towards 84-85 units. On-hand inventory is 356 units with an additional 289 units in-transit (ordered in P34, P35, P36). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that align with this lower late-autumn demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent drop to sub-100 levels while maintaining the recalculate method for lead time as it remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further cooled in mid-October: average demand for P35-P36 is ~84 units, down from the early-autumn average of ~140 units. This marks the transition into the late-autumn/winter low-demand period for this seasonal SKU.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late Autumn. Demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-season low-demand regime. Average demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) is approximately 92.7 units per period, down from the earlier autumn average of ~140. On-hand inventory is 247 units, and in-transit inventory is 289 units (orders from P34, P35, P36). Combined, the pipeline of 536 units covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand at current rates (~93 units/period). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a remaining game length of 10 periods, there is no immediate need to place new orders. To avoid accumulating excess holding costs ($1/unit/period) on a seasonal item that is clearly cooling down, the OR parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime (N=3) to minimize over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P35-P37): average demand dropped to ~93 units per period from the previous stabilization level of ~140 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is approximately 89 units. On-hand inventory is 264 units and there are 194 units in transit (expected to arrive in P39, P40). The current inventory position (458 total) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the remaining (L+1) periods (roughly 5 * 89 = 445). With only 9 periods left (P39-P47) and a 4-period lead time, we are approaching the horizon where orders placed now arrive near the end of the simulation. Given the existing surplus and the low-demand regime, I will use recent demand history (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed for P35-P38: average demand is ~89 units/period, down from the early-autumn average of ~140 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November), approaching the final 7 periods of the game (total 47). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is showing late-autumn/winter low demand. Since Period 35, demand has significantly dropped, averaging ~84 units for P35-P39. Specifically, the last two weeks (P38-P39) averaged only ~70 units. With 317 units currently on-hand and 118 in-transit (80 from P36 due in P40, 38 from P39 due in P43), total inventory is 435 units. Given the remaining 8 periods (current P40 + 7 remaining) and a demand rate of ~75-80 units, the total expected demand is approximately 600-640 units. Current inventory covers nearly 6 periods of this low demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P35-P39) to reflect this winter regime (Avg ~84), and L=4. This will result in a base stock around 420-450, effectively halting new significant orders given the high pipeline and on-hand inventory, which balances high service levels against end-of-season holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime for lightweight jersey t-shirts confirmed (P35-P39): demand has stabilized at a low average of ~84 units/period, with the most recent two weeks (P38-P39) dropping further to ~70 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, and the SKU is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal spring/summer item. We are now in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P35-P40) is ~81 units, with the last three periods specifically averaging ~69 units. On-hand inventory is 328 units, and 84 units are in-transit (ordered P39-P40). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Total pipeline and on-hand inventory (328 + 84 = 412) already covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (412 / 69 \u2248 5.9). Therefore, the OR backend will naturally minimize ordering. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand winter regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current stabilization around ~80 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P40) for lightweight jersey t-shirts stabilized at a lower average of ~81 units/period, down from the autumn average of ~140 units.

The SKU is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in a winter low-demand regime (late November). Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~81 units/period since Period 35, with the most recent four weeks averaging ~69 units. The on-hand inventory (261) plus in-transit stock (138) equals 399 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. With a conservative average demand estimate of 70 units per week, the target inventory level should be around 350-400 units. Since current pipeline inventory (399) is already at or above this target, and we are nearing the end of the game (Period 42/47), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the persistent winter low (P35-P41) while ensuring L is calculated based on the stable history of 4-period arrivals. This setting will naturally scale down ordering while maintaining a safe buffer for the remaining periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is currently in its winter low-demand regime. Average demand for the last 8 periods (P35-P42) is approximately 80 units/period. The most recent demand (P42) showed a slight uptick to 109 units, possibly due to early December shopping or promotions, but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is 152 units with 193 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). The total pipeline (345 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (total expected demand ~400-450 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the total inventory/pipeline already covers the (L+1) period window at the current demand rate, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8) to capture the winter demand level (~80 units/period) and its associated volatility since the late-autumn drop at Period 35.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P42) for lightweight jersey t-shirts has averaged ~80 units/period, despite a single-period spike to 109 in P42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in a winter demand regime (mid-December). Demand has stabilized at a lower level following the summer peak. For the recent winter period (P35-P43), demand averages approximately 81 units per period, with a slight spike in P42. The current on-hand inventory is 129 units and in-transit is 268 units (total pipeline 397). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 47, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48, which is after the game concludes. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current base stock and safety levels for the remaining periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P35-P43) to reflect the contemporary low-demand winter regime (~81/week), which prevents over-ordering as the game nears its end while maintaining sufficient stock for the next few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $925.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the winter demand regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Period 44 conclude shows an on-hand inventory of 120 and in-transit units of 295 (from orders in P41, P42, P43, P44). The demand remains low and stable, averaging ~73 units over the last five periods (P40-P44). Given the current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 415 units and the game ends in Period 47, we have sufficient stock to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (estimated at ~220 units total). The OR backend's base stock calculation must reflect this low-demand state to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining time. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current winter stabilization.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December) managing a lightweight jersey t-shirt. The winter demand regime (identified around P35) is stable and low. Recent demand for P43-P45 was 61, 55, and 64 units, respectively. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is approximately 75 units, reflecting a clear winter low. On-hand inventory is 110, and in-transit inventory is 266 units. Total pipeline inventory is 376 units, which covers about 5 weeks of winter demand at current rates. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need (1+L) = 5 weeks of coverage. The backend base stock calculation will naturally moderate ordering as long as we accurately reflect the current low-mean, low-volatility environment. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable winter demand and L=calculate to use the consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the year-end/winter period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey t-shirts. Demand has been in a stabilized low-demand regime since late October (Period 35). Recent historical demand (P43-P46) has been 61, 55, 64, 92, averaging approximately 68 units/period. The spike to 92 in P46 (Christmas week) is likely a minor holiday-related fluctuation rather than a permanent regime shift. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 73 units with 286 units in-transit (orders from P43-P46). Given the low winter demand, our current pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods. I will continue using the recent_N method (N=12, covering approximately the last 3 months since the transition from autumn to winter) to calculate parameters, ensuring the OR backend reflects the low-volume, stable winter regime.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P46) for lightweight jersey t-shirts is stable at approximately 78 units/period, with minor volatility (Std ~15). Recent December demand (P43-P46) reflects this lower baseline despite a minor holiday uptick to 92.
