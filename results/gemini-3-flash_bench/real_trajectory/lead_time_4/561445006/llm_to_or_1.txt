Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 561445006, a women's everyday basic Jersey T-shirt. Historically, the demand from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 (5 weeks) has been: 61, 71, 61, 52, 51. The mean is 59.2 and the standard deviation is 8.4. There is a slight downward trend in the most recent two weeks (52, 51), but as a 'Basic' item, demand should remain relatively stable. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, the OR backend requires parameters covering (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean (59.2 * 5 = 296) and the historical variance, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this baseline. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. The first order placed now will arrive in Period 5 (L=4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we experienced a demand of 98 units, which was significantly higher than the training samples average (~59 units). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand but can jump as spring styles are introduced in February. With 0 on-hand inventory and 73 units in transit (ordered in P1, promised lead time 4), we are currently stock-outed. To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent P1 demand (98) and the training average (~59), a conservative but responsive forecast for the next 5 periods is approximately 350-400 units. I will set mu_hat to 350 (70 per period * 5) to ensure the base stock calculation targets a level high enough to cover the lead time once shipments start arriving. Lead time L is kept at the promised 4 until observed otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's T-shirt (Everday Basics). Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) averaged 59.2 units/week. However, observations from Period 1 and 2 show a significant jump to 98 and 92 units respectively. This suggests a seasonal demand shift as we move from late winter into early spring (Feb/March). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 175 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the P1 order (73 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at P6). I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent higher demand regime (approx 95 units/week) and use recent_N to capture this localized trend. For L, I will use 'default' as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift from the promised 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in February: Moving from ~60 units/week (Jan) to ~95 units/week (Feb), likely seasonal for spring basics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019/3/4). This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand started around 60 units in January but surged significantly in February (98, 92, 130), averaging 106.6 units over the last 3 periods. This aligns with spring seasonality for basics as the weather warms. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 298 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is not expected to arrive until Period 5. Consequently, we have been stocking out. To recover and meet the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 3-period February demand (avg ~107). I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Carry-over insight: February/March demand surge: Demand increased from ~60 to ~107 units/week (+78%), confirming peak seasonality for spring basics.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical data showed a demand shift from ~60 units/week in January to an average of ~101 units/week in February/early March (Periods 1-4: 98, 92, 130, 84). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we began ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 439 units are in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Following the promised lead time, we expect arrivals to begin now. We maintain L at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, we use recent_N with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime observed in the game history (avg ~101), which is significantly higher than the initial January samples (~59). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current seasonal level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's T-shirt basic, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand over the last 5 periods (98, 92, 130, 84, 102) averages 101.2 units, significantly higher than the initial January average (~60). We have confirmed the lead time is indeed 4 periods, as the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first arrival (73 units) was insufficient to meet the demand of 102. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 470 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), but we must continue ordering to cover the (L+1=5) period horizon. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime of ~101 units/week, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~101 units/week (Periods 1-5) for spring seasonality, up from ~60 in Jan; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25. The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt, which is currently in a spring seasonal peak. History shows a clear demand regime shift from ~60 units in January to an average of 101.1 units over the last 6 periods (demand: 98, 92, 130, 84, 102, 101). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is nearly zero (1 unit) due to stockouts in previous periods. Total in-transit is 437 units (from P3, P4, P5, P6), which covers the pipeline for the next 4 periods at the current demand rate (~100 units/week). My goal is to maintain the base stock level considering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current spring demand regime and use the confirmed lead time L=4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of April 1st (Period 8), the product 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has entered a stable spring demand regime. Over the last 7 periods (excluding the initial pre-game samples), demand has averaged 101.7 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is low at 19 units, but there is a significant pipeline of 412 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving at Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. A large shipment of 141 units (ordered Period 4) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 8), followed by 104 units in Period 9 and 69 units in Period 10. Given the consistent demand pattern around 100-105 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the February/March demand shift while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 5 weeks of demand (L+1), effectively balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has shown a sustained demand increase since February (spring seasonality). Since P1, the average demand has stabilized at 103.25 units per week (min 84, max 130). The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current on-hand is 46, and in-transit is 376 (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Orders from P5 (104 units) are expected to arrive during the resolution of P9. Given the stable demand regime observed over the last 8 periods (~103 units/week), I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this spring season average and volatility. Lead time L is set to default as the promised 4 periods align with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 1-8 average is 103.3 units/week, up from ~60 in Jan. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Historically, we saw a demand regime shift from ~60 units/week in January to an average of ~103 units/week from February through March. In the most recent four periods (Periods 6-9), demand has averaged 101.75 units, showing stability after the spring surge. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P9). I will set L to 4 as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the stabilized spring regime (Periods 1-9) while excluding the lower January baseline. This gives an expected total demand over the lead time and review period (1+L=5 weeks). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the volatility observed during this spring season. The current in-transit inventory (393) plus on-hand (63) is 456, which covers approximately 4.5 weeks of demand at the 101/week rate, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the safety buffer.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which serves as a staple item. Since Period 1, the demand has stabilized at a significantly higher regime than in January, with an average of approximately 104 units per week over the last 10 periods (range 84-130). There have been no major spikes or drops recently, suggesting a steady mid-spring plateau. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P1 through P6). The current on-hand inventory is very low at 7 units, but there are 402 units in-transit (orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). With L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead). Total demand for 5 periods is roughly 520 units. Total pipeline (on-hand 7 + in-transit 402) is 409 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time to utilize the observed consistency.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are in a high-demand period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts), as evidenced by the spike in Period 11 demand to 183 units. Over the last 6 periods (P6-P11), demand has averaged 119 units, significantly higher than the earlier spring average of ~103. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P11 (183 demand vs 105 supply). I will use recent_N=6 to capture this intensified demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the stable 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified in late April: Average demand increased from 103 (P1-P8) to 119 (P6-P11), with a peak of 183 units in Period 11, indicating a late-spring/early-summer peak for basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has shown a clear demand intensification as we move into May. The average demand from Period 6 to Period 12 is approximately 119 units, but the recent Period 11 saw a spike to 183 units. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) after Period 12, despite an arrival of 105 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the lost sales in the last two periods (P11 and P12), I need to set mu_hat more aggressively to build back inventory and meet the (L+1) window (5 periods). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 625 (representing a 125 units/week forecast across 5 periods) and a slightly higher explicit sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in Period 11. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that prioritizes service level, which is critical given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is experiencing a sustained peak-season demand regime. Recent demand (P11-P13) has been 183, 117, and 133, averaging 144 units. This is significantly higher than the earlier spring average of 103 (P1-P8). We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) due to high demand and are relying on in-transit inventory. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since we have seen a demand shift starting around P11, I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture this higher summer-transition demand level (avg ~144) to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the increased volatility noted in the recent weeks (std dev is higher during the 183 unit peak). This aggressive setting aims to prevent further stockouts during the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-May: Average demand increased from ~103 (P1-P8) to ~144 (P11-P13), reflecting early summer peak for basics.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/20 (Period 15). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is experiencing high early-summer seasonality. Demand analysis: The last four periods (P11-P14) show demand of 183, 117, 133, and 141 (average ~143.5), confirming a shift from the previous average of ~103. The system is currently selling out (stockouts in P11-P14), indicating that recent orders have been insufficient. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in an upward trend for summer basics, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher 140+ unit regime. Pipeline stock is 686 units against an expected 5-period demand (L+1) of ~718, and on-hand is 0, so the OR backend needs to place aggressive orders to close the gap and prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect higher volatility (std ~28).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May). The product is a women's everyday basic t-shirt. Historical data confirms a sequence of demand regime shifts: Jan (approx 60/week), Feb-April (approx 100/week), and since Period 11 (mid-May), demand has surged to an average of ~144 units/week (last 5 periods: 183, 117, 133, 141, 148). The current date is May 27th, entering the peak summer season for t-shirts. We specify mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent sustained high-demand regime (avg ~144) across the (L+1) horizon. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P11 arrived P15). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 642 units in transit, but the persistent stockouts from P11-P15 indicate we were under-ordering for the summer surge. I will maintain L at the default promised lead time and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods of elevated demand to ensure the OR backend captures the higher mean and increased volatility from the peak season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03, entering the peak summer season for women's t-shirts. Demand has consistently outpaced supply, resulting in zero ending inventory for the last six periods. The average demand for the last five periods (P12-P16) is 145.8 units, compared to ~128 units for the preceding five. Specifically, Period 16 saw demand jump to 190 units, suggesting we are entering an even higher usage regime for summer basics. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this elevation (avg 145.8 per week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by every concluding order. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline (P13: 181, P14: 201, P15: 85, P16: 127) totals 594 units. Given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the target service level is 80%, but with high volatility (sigma_hat) and consistent stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mean and variance to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent further lost sales during the June peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Weekly demand increased to 190 units; 5-period average (P12-P16) now 145.8 units (+15% vs P11-P15 avg).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, mid-summer. The product is a women's everyday jersey T-shirt, which typically sees high demand in summer. Following a peak of 190 units in Period 16, demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 109 units. This could be a weekly fluctuation or the first sign of a summer plateau. However, the overall demand regime since Period 14 (mid-May) has averaged approximately 144.5 units ([(141+148+190+109)/4]). To prevent stockouts seen repeatedly in May, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher summer average while account for the recent dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern (P13 arrived in P17). Pipeline inventory (600) is robust, but on-hand is low (72) facing an expected arrival of 201 units (from P14) during the arrival phase of the current period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has shown high volatility recently: after a peak of 190 in P16, demand dropped to 109 in P17 and 81 in P18. This suggests we have passed the early summer peak (May/June) and are entering a mid-summer phase where demand may stabilize at a lower level or fluctuate. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is roughly 134 units, while the very recent 2nd-order trend suggests a cooling off. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 192 (highest ever) and a large pipeline (525), we are currently well-stocked. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the most recent high-demand period while accounting for the recent drop, and set sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value (45) to account for the extreme high/low variance observed (81 to 190). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in June: peak of 190 (P16) followed by a sharp drop to 81 (P18), suggesting a transition from the early summer surge to mid-summer stability at a lower mean.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a women's everyday t-shirt. We have observed a significant period of volatility and growth throughout the spring, peaking at 190 units in Period 16, followed by a correction (81 units in P18) and a rebound (146 units in P19). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights suggests we have moved past the initial early-summer surge. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 135 units/week. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all actual arrivals (P1-P15 orders). Given the high volatility (sigma) observed recently, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand level while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance. For lead time, since it is stable at 4, the default promised lead time is optimal.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer surge (P15-P19) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~135 units/week compared to the early spring average of ~103, despite significant week-to-week volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21 (2019/07/01). The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics). Historically, demand for this item surged throughout various phases of spring and early summer leading up to June. Recently, the demand has displayed high volatility: Period 16 (190), P17 (109), P18 (81), P19 (146), and P20 (109). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 127 units. As we move into July, we enter the mid-summer period where demand for basics often stabilizes or slightly declines from the peak early-summer surge. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Inventory health is stable with 149 on hand and a healthy pipeline of 495 units. Given the recent volatility yet sustained average, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current state of 127 units/week while accounting for the high standard deviation observed in the June fluctuations.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', currently in July. Historically, demand peaked in mid-May to early June (reaching 190 units in Period 16), but has since cooled down. The last five periods (P17-P21) show a mean demand of approximately 98 units (109, 81, 146, 109, 73), significantly lower than the preceding summer surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (263) and substantial in-transit orders (379), we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this post-peak stabilization and prevent excessive ordering while waiting for the summer inventory push to clear through sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Post-summer peak cooling confirmed. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) dropped to ~98 units/week, down from the ~145 units/week seen during the May/June surge.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, and the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt. Historical data confirms a significant cooling of demand following the May/June summer surge. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) has dropped to approximately 93 units/week (81, 146, 109, 73, 56), which is lower than the previous regime. The latest data point (56 units) suggests we are returning to levels closer to the initial January baseline or early spring average. On-hand inventory (333 units) plus pipeline inventory (253 units) currently provides a very high coverage relative to this cooling demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and the downward demand trend, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 to reflect the post-peak cooling while allowing the OR backend to minimize unnecessary ordering and manage the holding cost of the current excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained: P18-P22 average demand dropped to ~93 units/week from the May/June peak of ~145.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are managing a women's jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics). The demand history shows a clear seasonal peak during May and June (averaging ~145 units) followed by a significant cooling period in July. The last five periods (P19-P23) have an average demand of 75.2 units, a substantial drop from the early summer surge. We currently have 278 units on-hand and 216 units in-transit (orders from P20 and P21). The total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 494 units, which is extremely high relative to the recent demand of ~75 units/week. Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (review + lead time). At current rates, 5 * 75.2 = 376 units, which is well below our current 494. Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent the system from over-ordering while we bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization: July demand (P20-P23) has settled at a lower mean of ~82 units/week, significantly down from the May/June peak of ~145.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable mid-summer cooling phase. The high-demand regime of May/June (avg ~145) has clearly subsided; the last five periods (P20-P24) show a much lower average demand of 81.6 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 345 units currently on-hand and 119 in-transit (orders from P21 and P24), and an estimated weekly demand of ~82, the inventory level is quite high (approx. 4 weeks of coverage). However, to maintain the service level across the L+1 window (5 periods) and account for the observed volatility in this SKU, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (the current stable regime) and keep sigma_hat based on recent volatility to prevent over-stocking while the system absorbs the existing excess from the previous surge.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) stabilized at ~82 units/week (P20-P24), a significant decrease from the early summer peak. Inventory levels are currently high due to trailing orders from the previous peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Analysis of the demand history (P21-P25) confirms a significant cooling of demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 72 units/week (down from peak summer levels of ~145). Current inventory levels are very high (On-hand: 356 units) because orders placed during the high-demand June regime (P17-P21) have been arriving. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (356) and the remaining in-transit (48), the total pipeline of 404 units is sufficient to cover approximately 5.6 periods of demand at the current rate of ~72/week. Since the base stock calculation for a (L+1)=5 period horizon suggests a need for roughly 360-390 units (depending on safety stock), and we have 404, the OR backend will likely order 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this lower, stabilized August demand regime and prevent over-ordering as we move further into late summer.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (August) confirmed at ~72 units/week (P21-P25), continuing the cooling trend from the May/June peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts has clearly shifted from a high-summer peak (May/June avg ~145) to a late-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 73 units/week (56, 92, 78, 60, 78). This is a significant and sustained drop. Current inventory is very high (278 on-hand) relative to this new demand level, as a result of orders placed during the previous peak arriving now. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and lower demand regime, the OR backend needs to avoid over-ordering. I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized late-summer demand level and calculate for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period history.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend from the May/June peak (~145 units) to a late-summer low. Demand for the last 4 periods (P24-P27) has averaged approximately 65.75 units (78, 60, 78, 47). The carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (231 units) due to large orders placed during the seasonal peak arriving as demand declined. In-transit inventory is 114 units (from Period 24 and Period 27 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the current demand regime (~66 units/week), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering late July and August) to reflect the stabilized lower demand and prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential late-summer fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (August) has settled into a lower regime of ~66 units/week (P24-P27), significantly lower than the early summer peak. Inventory is currently clearing from previous high-volume arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26, entering late August/early September. The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has clearly transitioned from a peak summer regime (~145 units) to a significantly lower late-summer/fall regime. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaged 64 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 222 units, which is roughly 3.5 weeks of current demand. In-transit inventory (96 units) consists of orders from P27 (66 units) and P28 (30 units), which are expected to arrive in P31 and P32 respectively. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, we want to avoid excessive stock during this cooling period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for this item (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has consistently decreased since the early summer peak. In August (Periods 26-29), demand averaged ~56.5 units/week, down from the June/July average of ~82 and the May peak of ~145. Recent demand samples (P24-P29) are: 78, 60, 78, 47, 57, 44, showing a clear stabilization at a lower level. Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (178) is still high relative to current demand, though it is drawing down. In-transit inventory (124) consists of orders from Periods 27, 28, and 29. By using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I capture this post-summer stabilization (Mean ~60.6, Std ~14.4). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that prevents over-ordering while the system clears excess inventory, while still maintaining high service levels for the new regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Late-summer/Early-fall demand has stabilized at ~57 units/week (P26-P29), down from ~145 in May/June and ~82 in July.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a women's basic T-shirt, which has transitioned from a high-demand summer season (May/June peak ~145 units) into a significantly lower fall demand regime. Demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) has averaged 53.4 units/week (78, 47, 57, 44, 40), confirming a stabilization around ~50-60 units. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 138, In-transit: 153) due to trailing orders from the higher-demand periods. With a total pipeline of 291 units and a daily demand of ~54 units, we have coverage for over 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further inventory bloat and minimize holding costs while the system works through existing stock, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods) and applying the default lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has stabilized at ~53 units/week (P26-P30 average), down from the summer peak as the season transitions to fall.

The average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 40.8 units, compared to the P26-P30 average of 53 units, confirming a sustained decline. The current on-hand inventory of 171 units plus the in-transit inventory of 91 units (total 262) is very high relative to the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that represent this lower 'Fall' regime to prevent further excess inventory accumulation while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime shift confirmed: demand has dropped further to an average of ~41 units/week (P27-P31) from the early September average of ~53 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has continued its clear downward trend as we move further into the fall season. The last 5 periods (P28-P32) have seen a mean demand of 32.4 units, with the most recent period dropping to 21 units. This confirms the 'fall demand regime shift' noted in Period 32. On-hand inventory is currently high at 180 units, which is significantly more than needed to cover the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (32.4 * 5 = 162). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the declining demand trend, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend avoids over-ordering while we bleed off the excess inventory. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent (lower) volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its seasonal decline as we enter fall (late September/October). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) has dropped to approximately 34.2 units/week, down from the early-September average of ~53 units. Significant excess inventory (175 units on-hand) remains from orders placed during higher demand periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets high service levels, but current stock levels (on-hand + in-transit = 208 units) already cover approximately 6 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks of lower demand) to reflect the current regime and prevent unnecessary new orders while the system clears existing stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (late September) has stabilized at ~34 units/week (P29-P33 average), a significant drop from the summer peak and the early September average of ~53 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has continued its seasonal decline from the summer peak (~145 units) to a stabilized fall regime of approximately 34 units/week (average P29-P33). The most recent demand outcomes (P31-P34: 33, 21, 33, 35) confirm this low-volume stability. Current on-hand inventory is 169 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), estimated at roughly 170 units (34 * 5). The in-transit pipeline is nearly empty (4 units), which is appropriate given the high on-hand surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent N=5 average (approx 31.4 units/period) resulting in a target base stock that will prevent new orders until the existing surplus is further depleted, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for the lower fall demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at ~34 units/week (P29-P34), decreasing significantly from the summer peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019, transitioning into late fall/winter. Historical data shows a clear downward demand regime shift for 'Womens Everyday Basics' since the summer peak. The established late-September/early-October demand average is approximately 32 units/week (P29-P35 avg). On-hand inventory is currently high (150 units) relative to this demand, covering almost 5 weeks. Total pipeline (on-hand 150 + in-transit 3) is 153 units. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, the target total inventory should cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. 5 * 32 = 160 units. With 153 units currently available/incoming, a small replenishment order is necessary soon, but we must be cautious about holding costs as demand continues to cool into winter. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current low-volume regime (~29 units/week) and default for lead-time as it has remained consistent at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt has continued to decline significantly as the season moves into late fall/winter. Recent demand (P32-P36) has averaged ~24 units/week, with the most recent observation being only 10 units. We are currently holding an inventory surplus (on-hand 140 units), which is approximately 5.8 weeks of coverage at the current mean demand, well exceeding our target cycle stock and safety stock needs for a 4-period lead time. With a profit of $4.00 and a holding cost of $1.00, the OR backend targets a high service level (80%), but the 'cap' mechanism in the backend will naturally limit any unnecessary ordering given the high inventory and low demand trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P32-P36) to capture the current lower demand regime (~24 units/week) and use default for L and sigma_hat. No new order is expected to be placed by the backend because on-hand inventory + in-transit (148 total) is far higher than the required base stock (~120-130 units based on recent stats).

Carry-over insight: Late Fall demand regime shift confirmed: demand has dropped to an average of ~24 units/week (P32-P36) from the early September average of ~34 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late fall/winter. Demand has stabilized into a much lower regime, with the average of the last 6 periods (P32-P37) being approximately 24 units/week. Recent individual samples (10, 22) suggest this lower level is consistent. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 118 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand (~5 weeks of cover). In-transit inventory is 64 units (orders from P35, P36, P37). Pipeline inventory totals 182 units, covering roughly 7.5 periods of current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~24 units/week) and use default for L and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock while allowing inventory to bleed off.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a women's everyday t-shirt, typically a staple with seasonal variability. Demand has entered a significantly lower regime in late autumn (Nov), averaging ~18.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P34-P38: 35, 23, 10, 22, 20). This is a sharp decline from the summer peak of ~145. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P31, P32, P33, P34, P35 all showed lead_time=4). Inventory is currently at 98 on-hand with 85 in-transit (Total pipeline = 183). Given the current demand of ~19 units/week, the pipeline covers nearly 10 weeks of supply. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low-demand winter regime accurately, which will prevent the OR backend from over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (November) confirmed at ~19 units/week (P34-P38 average), continuing the decline from the fall average of ~34. Total pipeline (183) significantly exceeds immediate requirements.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, entering the mid-winter season for a basic T-shirt. Demand has significantly cooled and stabilized at a low level. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 18.0 units/week. On-hand inventory is 86 units, and the pipeline is 82 units (totaling 168), which covers over 9 weeks of current demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we only need coverage for 5 periods (~90 units). We are currently overstocked and do not need to place additional orders. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current low-demand winter regime (~18 units/week), which will likely result in a 0 order until inventory levels normalize.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has seen a significant demand decline as we move into late November. The current demand regime has stabilized at a very low level, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging approximately 16.4 units/week. Inventory levels remain high (On-hand: 76, In-transit: 77, Total: 153) relative to this low demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~16 units/week, we need approximately 80 units of total inventory. Since our current total inventory (153) is nearly double that requirement, No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (roughly the last 1.5 months) to reflect this winter low, ensuring the OR engine calculates a low base stock and emits a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (November/December) confirmed: Average demand has dropped to ~16 units/week (P36-P40), continuing the downward trend from the fall average of ~34.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the end of the year. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has consistently declined from its summer peak (~145 units) to a stable winter regime of approximately 15-20 units per week. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 16.8 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (120 units) relative to this demand level, providing significantly more than the required coverage for the (L+1) period window (approx. 5 weeks * 17 units = 85 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the low demand regime, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to accurately reflect the current winter demand and allow the OR engine to naturally pause ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (late November) confirmed at ~17 units/week (P37-P41 average), down from the previous fall average of ~34.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the mid-winter/holiday period. Demand for this everyday basic T-shirt has stabilized at a low winter baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 21 units/week, with a recent spike to 43 in P42 (potential start of holiday gift-buying). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 98 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 and a demand baseline of ~21 units, the current 98 units cover roughly 4.6 periods of demand. Since the OR engine targets (L+1) periods (5 periods), the current inventory is nearly sufficient to cover the pipeline needs without major new ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the winter demand level (avg ~21) while accounting for the recent holiday volume increase.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick: Period 42 demand increased to 43 units from a previous 4-week average of ~15, likely reflecting early December holiday shopping.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We observed a demand spike in Period 42 (43 units), likely due to early December holiday shopping, but demand dropped back to 9 units in Period 43. Historically, seasonal basics see fluctuations around the holidays. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 89 units on-hand and 31 in-transit (total 120), we are well-covered for the current low-demand winter regime (~17 units/week). However, given the potential for further holiday-related volatility or a return to the early spring surge as we approach the end of the year, I will set mu_hat to reflect a slightly elevated mean compared to the very recent low of 9, while relying on recent_N for sigma to capture the volatility seen in Period 42. Using explicit mu_hat of 125 based on an estimated weekly mean of 25 (covering (1+4) periods) to maintain a buffer for year-end demand without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility detected: Period 42 showed a demand spike (43 units) compared to the November average of ~15, followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (9 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (Period 45). Demand for this 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown high volatility recently, with a holiday spike of 43 in P42 followed by 9 and 26. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approximately 21 units/week. This is slightly higher than the November average (~16 units) due to seasonal holiday shopping. Inventory levels are currently comfortable with 63 on-hand and 62 in-transit (total 125). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we want to maintain a high service level while recognizing that demand typically settles after the holiday peak in early January. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the 21 units/week mean and rely on a moderate sigma_hat to buffer against the holiday volatility observed in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (Dec) characterized by high volatility: extreme fluctuation between 9 and 43 units/week around a mean of ~21 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the final stages of the holiday shopping season. Historical data shows that demand spiked in late November/early December (Period 42: 43 units) and has since stabilized with moderate volatility (Periods 43-45: 9, 26, 28 units). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 26.5 units. Considering the item is a jersey basic t-shirt, we expect demand to remain steady or slightly elevated through the end of the year before the typical January lull. On-hand inventory is 35 units and total in-transit is 69 units. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, order arrivals are predictable. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect the December holiday mean (~26.5 units/week), ensuring enough stock for the 5-period window (L+1) without over-ordering as we approach the lower-demand January period. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to capture the current holiday-induced volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the end of the year. Demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey tops has stabilized into a winter regime with a mean of ~21 units/week over the last 5 periods (P42-P46), notwithstanding the early December volatility. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 16, and there is a large pipeline of 119 units (including orders from P43-P46 totaling 119). Since the pipeline significantly exceeds the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (5 * 21 = 105), the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current winter demand level (~21) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent holiday fluctuation. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current low-demand season while accounting for the high volatility observed in December.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (December) stabilized at ~21 units/week (P42-P46 average), characterized by high holiday volatility compared to November.
