Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend in demand: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145. This suggests the product is ramping up, likely due to a seasonal shift into spring or a new product launch. The mean of the historical samples is 110.2, and the standard deviation is approximately 46.8. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend logic requires parameters covering 1+L (5) periods. Given the growth trend, I will use a conservative forecast that reflects the recent higher levels rather than the early low numbers. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand cluster (avg ~140). This will result in mu_hat = 5 * 140 = 700. For L, I will use the default promised lead time as there is no history of arrivals yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic jersey legging. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145, and most recently 135 in Period 1. The average of the last 4 samples (121, 153, 145, 135) is approximately 138.5. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units which are now in-transit. Since we started with 0 on-hand and 0 arrived in Period 1, we had 135 lost sales. We need to ensure the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the item is a 'Divided Basic', demand is relatively stable but currently high. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~130 units/period) and recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. L is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from promised.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg' leggings. Historically, demand has been increasing (37, 95, 121, 153, 145) and the last two periods show demand of 135 and 191. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 336 units in transit (168 ordered in P1, 168 in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5. Current demand is high (avg ~140 over last 7 points). With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR engine will target the median demand. Since recent demand is clearly higher and trending upward from the older data points, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history would. Since no orders have arrived yet (as expected given L=4), L will remain as default.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 189616006 (Divided Basics Leggings) has had zero sales since Period 1 because starting on-hand inventory was 0 and no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (Feb 11) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+4), P2 in Period 6, and P3 in Period 7. Current history shows demand for the last 5 periods (including historical samples) as: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145, followed by P1-P3 demand of 135, 191, and 132. The mean demand is approximately 126 units/period. Since no arrivals have occurred yet (as expected per L=4), there is no evidence yet that the lead time is varying from 4. I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full trajectory from the early low-demand periods through the recent stabilization around 130-150 units. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU 189616006 (Heavy jersey leggings) is a basic item. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has shown an upward trend: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145 (pre-game) followed by 135, 191, 132, 140 (game play). Average demand across all 9 samples is approximately 127.7 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0, with 631 units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (168 units) should arrive during Period 1+4=5 (this period) and will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 through Period 4 is expected and does not yet indicate a lead-time deviation or lost shipment. Since demand is relatively stable but has significantly higher recent values compared to the very early pre-game samples, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (~147 units/week) more accurately than the full average. This helps ensure the base_stock calculation (which targets demand for L+1 = 5 periods) accounts for the current higher volume and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. Based on the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming the actual lead time L = 4 (as promised). This confirms the 1-period observation delay described in the instructions. Demand history shows values: 135, 191, 132, 140, 125, plus pre-history values 37, 95, 121, 153, 145. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 144.6 units, while the total historical average is 127.4. There is a visible upward trend from the earliest samples to the current period. Given the product (leggings) and the transition from winter to spring (mid-March), demand is stabilizing at a higher level than January. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. With L=4, on-hand (43) and in-transit (575) total 618 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand at current rates. The backend will adjust the order to reach the base stock target for (L+1) periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a jersey basic legging. Historical demand shows a mean of 110.3 units across the 5 provided pre-game samples (Jan/early Feb) and a slightly higher mean of 139 units during the first 6 game periods. Current demand seems to be settling around the 110-140 range after an initial spike in Period 2. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. We currently have 100 on-hand and 512 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Since profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the objective is to maintain a service level around 50%, though the OR backend uses a capped policy that targets a higher buffer. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the in-game demand average (approx 139) while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The target mu_hat should reflect demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat will set it to 5 * ~139 = 695.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a jersey legging (Divided Basics), which shows steady demand. Historical demand samples (before P1) showed an upward trend (37 to 145), but since Period 1, demand has stabilized between 110 and 191. The last three periods (P5-P7) show a downward trend in demand (125 -> 111 -> 110). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7. Inventory is currently high (183 on-hand + 402 in-transit = 585 units) compared to the current 5-period demand forecast (approximately 115 * 5 = 575). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the service level q is 0.5 (z* = 0), meaning the backend aims to hold stock equal to the expected demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the recent stabilization/slight decline and keep L at default since it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across 3 consecutive observations (P5-P7). Demand stabilized between 110-140 units/week after initial P1-P2 peaks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a jersey basic legging. Demand has stabilized following early volatility. Over the last four periods (P5-P8), demand has been 125, 111, 110, and 116 units respectively (mean \u2248 115.5). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods by four consecutive arrivals (P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 169 units, with 333 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which aligns with the base stock logic utilizing the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stable demand regime and set L to the confirmed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by observations from P5 to P9). On-hand inventory is healthy at 190 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) of 297 units is well-aligned with the (L+1) horizon. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) with an average of approximately 110.6 units, compared to the overall average of 126 units which was skewed by higher initial demand in P1-P4. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs (given profit equals holding cost), I am focusing on the recent demand regime (last 5 periods). Setting \u03bc\u0302 using recent_N=5 captures this stabilization, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 reflects the current lower volatility. This conservative approach balances stock availability with the risk of holding excess inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Heavy jersey leggings (Divided Basics) are typically a year-round staple, but we are entering late spring where demand might soften slightly. Observing the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the average demand is 105 units, which is lower than the initial historical data (P1-P5 avg: 144.6) and the early game history. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P5 through P10. We have 198 units on-hand and 258 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). With Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) being equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median of demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be trending down toward 100 units/week, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current regime of ~105 units/week.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~125 to ~95 units over the last three weeks, potentially reflecting late spring seasonality for heavy leggings.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. The product is 'Heavy jersey leggings', which is experiencing a seasonal decline in demand (recent weekly demand: 91, 97, 74) as temperatures rise in spring. I identified a regime shift starting at Period 9 in the previous carry-over. Demand over the last 3 periods (Period 9-11) averages ~87 units compared to ~125 in the early period. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as observed through Period 11 (arrivals for orders 1 through 7 all show L=4). On-hand inventory is currently high (207) with 244 units in-transit. Given the high on-hand and declining demand, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and higher volatility observed during this transition, aiming to prevent further inventory creep as holding costs equal profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 demand (avg 87.3) is significantly lower than Period 5-8 (avg 115.5), reflecting seasonal decline for 'heavy jersey' items in late spring.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The product is 'heavy jersey leggings', which is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late spring/early summer. Demand has dropped from a peak of 110-140 units (Periods 4-8) to a steady low of 73-74 units in the last two periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (167) plus in-transit (211) equals 378 units. Given the current demand rate of ~74 units/week, this pipeline covers over 5 periods of demand (378 / 74 \u2248 5.1). To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand period (where holding cost equals profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 4 periods, N=4) and keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to allow the OR backend to slowly deplete existing stock while maintaining a minimal safety buffer for the lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~74 units/week over Periods 11-12, confirming a ~40% reduction from early spring peak (~125).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product consists of 'heavy jersey' leggings, which are experiencing a clear seasonal decline as temperatures rise in the late spring. Demand in the most recent period (P13) dropped to 54 units, continuing the downward trend established since Period 9. The average demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) is 67 units, compared to the early spring peak of ~125. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated through P13). With current on-hand inventory at 189 units and 176 units in-transit (total 365), we have enough stock to cover over 5 weeks of demand at the current average (67 units/week). Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand. To prevent overstocking during this seasonal decline, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent (lower) demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand continued seasonal decline: 3-period rolling average dropped from 87 to 67 units (P11-P13). Total pipeline (365 units) is significantly high relative to current demand trends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/20. The product is a 'heavy sturdy jersey' legging, which is clearly entering a low-demand summer phase. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 68.25 units, significantly lower than the early spring peak (>120 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 183 units and there are 110 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P11 and P13). Total pipeline inventory is 293 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the current period (P15) plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). With a projected demand of ~65-70 units per week, 5 periods of demand equals ~325-350 units. Our current pipeline (293) is close to this target. Since the holding cost is equal to profit ($1.00), excess inventory is very costly. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent seasonal low and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L remains default (4). The backend OR engine will likely order 0 or very few units because our existing stock nearly covers the projected need in this declining demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: P11-P14 demand stabilized around 68 units/week (standard deviation ~8), confirming the seasonal transition to summer lows for 'heavy jersey' products.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in the late spring/early summer season for 'Heavy jsy long leg' leggings. A clear demand regime shift occurred around Period 9, with demand declining from a 110-140 range down to a 50-75 range. The last five periods (P11-P15) show a mean demand of approximately 64.6 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high current on-hand inventory (202 units), the strategy must focus on inventory reduction to avoid excess carrying costs. The pipeline consists of 90 units (from P13 and P15 orders), putting total inventory position at 292 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the period since the decline stabilized) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'heavy jersey' leggings continue their seasonal decline as summer approaches. Demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) has been 72, 50, and 48 units, averaging 56.7 units/week\u2014a continued drop from the ~68 unit floor identified in Period 15. The 'arrived=0' message in Period 16 conclude is expected behavior, as the order from Period 12 was 0 units. Promised lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (154) plus in-transit (121) totals 275 units, which targets over 4 periods of supply at the current demand rate. We must set parameters to avoid overstocking during this low-demand season where holding costs ($1.0) equal profit ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5 and a target service level of 50%. Setting N=5 for demand capture reflects the most recent 5-week softening (P12-P16 average: 59.4), ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are responsive to the current summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued at Period 16: 3-period average dropped to 56.7 units (P14-P16), confirming a further ~20% decline from the previous 68-unit floor as summer begins.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are in a sustained summer low for 'heavy jersey' leggings. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) at an average of 55.75 units/week (72, 50, 48, 53), which is a significant drop from the early spring peak of ~125. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 13 order arriving in Period 17 (note: the Period 12 order was 0, so no arrival was expected in Period 16). On-hand inventory is 142 units, which is approximately 2.5 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 102 units, consisting of orders from P15 (49 units), P16 (31 units), and P17 (22 units). Total stock (244) covers over 4 weeks of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current seasonal floor. I am using a recent window for sigma_hat to capture the reduced volatility of this stable summer period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed at ~56 units/week (observed Periods 14-17), representing a ~55% reduction from spring peak levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, deep into the summer season for 'heavy jersey long leg' leggings. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a new low of 36 units in Period 18. The 3-period rolling average (P16-P18) is now 45.7 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a summer floor, but recent data suggests the floor may be even lower than 56 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the absence of a 'Period 12 order' arrival (the order quantity was 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in Period 16). Period 18 also saw 'arrived=0' because the order from Period 14 was 0 units. I am setting L to 4 based on the consistent historical performance. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the significant downward trend (mean demand P14-P18 is ~51.8), resulting in a forecast of 259.0 units for the 5-period window (L+1). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. With on-hand (106) and in-transit (137) totaling 243 units, the system is well-covered against a target base stock reflecting these lower summer volumes, preventing over-ordering and high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor revised downward: P16-P18 demand averaged 45.7 units, a further ~20% drop from the previously established summer floor of 56.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Early Summer). The product is 'Heavy jersey leggings', which is highly seasonal and currently in its summer demand floor. Demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged 41.3 units (53, 36, 35), marking a significant drop from the spring peak (~125) and previous summer floor estimates (~56). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (120) and in-transit units (104) are still high relative to the current weekly demand of ~41 units. The total pipeline (224 units) covers over 5 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lowest demand regime and allow the OR backend to minimize orders while excess stock is consumed, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), requiring a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor revised at Period 20: P17-P19 average demand is 41.3 units, representing the seasonal minimum for heavy jersey leggings during summer.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. The product 'Heavy jsy long leg' is in its seasonal summer trough. Demand has hitting a new low of 20 units in Period 20, with the average over the last three periods (P18-P20) being 30.3 units. This confirms the 'summer floor' is lower than previously estimated. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P20 arrival was from P16). On-hand inventory (131) plus in-transit (73) totals 204 units, which is approximately 6-7 weeks of current demand coverage. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and summer low demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new seasonal minimum and avoid over-ordering, while keeping lead time at the stable 'calculate' (observed 4) level.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached seasonal trough in Period 20: 3-period average (P18-P20) dropped to ~30 units/week, down from ~41 units/week previously.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-08, mid-summer. The product is 'Heavy jersey leggings', which is seasonally inappropriate for the current high-summer weather in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has consistently declined since Period 9 (April), reaching a seasonal trough in the last three periods (P19-P21 demand: 35, 20, 21). The 3-period average is approx 25.3 units/week. On-hand inventory (132) plus in-transit stock (51) totals 183 units. At a demand rate of ~25 units/week, this represents over 7 weeks of coverage, significantly exceeding the (L+1) requirement of 5 weeks. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly equal to lead-time demand. Given the current surplus and the high holding cost relative to profit, a further reduction in ordering is necessary to bleed off excess inventory. I will monitor for a potential late-summer or early-autumn recovery in demand, but for now, the priority is minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal trough confirmed for July: P19-P21 demand averaged 25.3 units/week, a ~38% drop from the June average of ~41 units/week and an 80% drop from the spring peak (~125).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-15. The product is 'heavy jersey leggings', which is seasonally counter-cyclical for summer. Demand has reached a significant trough in July: recent demand samples for Periods 20-22 are 20, 21, and 40 units (average 27). Although P22 saw a slight uptick, demand remains far below the spring average of ~125. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 127 units, with 16 units in-transit (ordered P19, expected to arrive Period 23). This provides an available supply of 143 units. Given the low summer demand regime, this inventory is sufficient to cover more than 5 periods even if demand recovers slightly. To minimize holding costs at a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical for low-margin items), no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set to match the recent 3-period trough demand to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering during this seasonal low.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilizing at seasonal trough: P20-P22 average is 27 units/week, down ~78% from the spring peak (~125), confirming July as the lowest demand period for heavy jersey leggings.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/22. The product is a 'heavy sturdy jersey' legging, which has experienced a significant seasonal decline throughout late spring and summer. Demand has hit its seasonal trough in July, though Period 22 & 23 saw a slight uptick (40 and 47 units vs previous sub-30 levels), potentially signaling the start of a recovery as we move toward late August/Autumn preparations. On-hand inventory is 96 units with no pipeline. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (Periods 20-23) to capture the current demand trough (avg ~32 units) while acknowledging the slight recent increase. This provides for demand over 5 periods (L+1) without carrying excessive inventory into the summer heat.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is 'heavy sturdy jersey leggings,' which has experienced a significant seasonal decline throughout the summer, hitting a trough in July. Recent demand (P22-P24) has slightly fluctuated (40, 47, 28) with an average of 38.3 units/week. While this is slightly higher than the early July trough (~25 units), it remains low compared to spring peaks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 68 units with 55 units in-transit (ordered P24), totaling 123 units of pipeline inventory. Given the service level target (profit=holding_cost implies a 50% critical fractile, but the OR backend uses profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5, which results in z=0), the backend will aim for a base stock equal to mu_hat. To prevent over-ordering as we near the potential end of the summer low, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable but low demand (average ~34 units/week). This reflects the current 5-period (L+1) demand requirement of ~170 units. With 123 units currently available/incoming, the system will place a moderate order to maintain safety stock as we approach August, when demand for 'heavy jersey' usually begins to recover for the fall season.

Carry-over insight: Demand began a slight recovery from the July trough (avg 25) to a late-July average of 38.3 units/week (P22-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th. Historically, this product (Heavy jersey leggings) experienced a significant demand trough in July (approx. 25 units/week) and is now showing signs of late-summer/early-fall recovery. Period 25 demand was 63 units, significantly higher than the preceding July average, signaling the start of the 'Back to School' or pre-fall seasonal uptick. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), while in-transit (102 units) includes an order from P24 (55 units) and P25 (47 units), both expected around P28-P29. The order from Period 12 (0 units), 14 (0 units), 20 (0 units), 21 (0 units), 22 (0 units), and 23 (0 units) means no stock is arriving imminently to replenish the current 5 units on hand. With demand rising (P25=63), there is a high risk of stockout before the P24 order arrives in P28. Therefore, I will set mu_hat explicitly to capture this recovery (forecasted at 60 units/week) across the (L+1) horizon to trigger an immediate replenishment order. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Period 25 demand (63) is more than double the July trough average (~25), signaling the start of pre-fall/back-to-school seasonality for heavy jersey leggings.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Heavy jersey leggings' is entering its peak fall/back-to-school season (mid-August). Demand has surged from a July trough (~25 units) to 63 units in Period 25 and 89 units in Period 26. This represents a significant regime shift upwards. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (190 units) expected to arrive over the next few periods (reflecting orders from P24-P26). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To capture the full uplift and prevent further lost sales during the peak season, mu_hat is set using an explicit forecast of 115 units per week (approaching the spring peak level) across the review and lead time windows (L+1 = 5 periods), resulting in 575 units. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility during this seasonal transition and sharp demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Weekly demand increased from late-July trough (~38) to 89 units (+134%), signaling peak fall/back-to-school seasonality. Predicted weekly mean is adjusted toward 100-120 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Heavy jersey leggings' is entering its peak seasonal demand phase (back-to-school/fall). Demand has surged from a July trough of ~25 units to over 100 units in the most recent period (P27 demand: 105). Currently, we are at zero on-hand inventory and seeing lost sales. Although there is 344 units in-transit, none arrived in the last four periods (P24-P27), indicating either a lead time stretch or a gap in the ordering pipeline from the low-demand summer period. Given the clear demand regime shift starting at Period 26, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the upward momentum (Avg P25-P27: 85.7 units/week). L remains at the confirmed 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 accounts for the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed: Late August demand (P26-P27) averaged 97 units/week, up from the July trough of ~25 units, driven by fall seasonality for heavy jersey leggings.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey leggings', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late August (Period 29), entering the peak fall/back-to-school demand regime. History shows a clear upward shift starting around Period 25: demand has increased from a July trough of ~25 units to over 100 units in the last two weeks (P27: 105, P28: 101). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. The pipeline inventory (374 units) reflects large orders placed in Periods 26-28 (88, 154, 85) to chase this recovery. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the back-to-school peak and the transition into cooler months, demand is expected to remain high, similar to the early spring levels (~125 units). I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this rapid seasonal acceleration, which will result in a forecast mu_hat of approx (1+4) * 98 = 490. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these higher sales volumes while the pipeline catches up to satisfy demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from July trough (~25) to avg 103 units/week (P27-P28), mirroring early spring peaks. This level is expected to sustain through early autumn.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'heavy jersey leggings' is currently in a sustained upward regime shift driven by fall seasonality and back-to-school trends (September start). Recent demand (P26-P29) averaged 91.75 units per week, significantly higher than the July trough (~25). Although P29 showed a slight dip to 72, the overall trend justifies a forecast aligned with early spring peaks (~110-120 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The system is currently experiencing stockouts due to the rapid demand increase; however, a large pipeline of 440 units is in transit. To set the base stock correctly for the OR backend, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the fall regime mean (approx. 92, resulting in a mu_hat around 460 for L+1=5). I will also use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime (P26-P29) average confirmed at 91.8 units/week, up from summer trough of 25. High volatility observed during regime shift.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9), entering the peak fall season for 'heavy jersey leggings'. Historical demand patterns show a clear regime shift from the summer trough (avg ~25) to a fall/back-to-school level (avg ~92 units over P26-P30). Recent demand has been 89, 105, 101, 72, and 83. While the pipeline is large (371 units), current on-hand inventory is critically low (5 units), and we have experienced stockouts in recent periods. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels during this shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current fall demand regime (~90 units/week). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility seen during this regime transition. These parameters should ensure the system orders enough to replenishment the pipeline while the backend OR logic manages the large in-transit volume against the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime (P26-P30) mean established at 90 units/week, reversing the summer trough. Volatility remains high during internal season transitions.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak fall season (mid-September). Recent demand (P26-P31) has averaged 91.8 units/week, a significant recovery from the summer trough (~25 units). The most recent demand (P31) was 99 units, confirming the 'Fall/Back-to-school' regime identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 60 units with a healthy pipeline of 291 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will aim for the median of the demand distribution (base_stock = mu_hat). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current fall regime's mean (91.8) and volatility, which ensures the base stock reflects the current season rather than the full-year average including the summer lull.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in its autumn/back-to-school peak. Analysis of demand from Period 26 to 32 shows a stabilized high-demand regime with a mean of 91.0 units/week (observed values: 89, 105, 101, 72, 83, 99, 85). Period 32 saw demand of 85 units, maintaining this trend. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32 (85 units). On-hand inventory is currently 60, with 313 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Since the profit to holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the risk horizon (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 captures the entirety of the current fall regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the high volatility (standard deviation ~11.5) observed during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (heavy jersey) confirmed stable over 7 periods (P26-P32) with a mean of 91.0 units/week, up significantly from the summer trough of ~25 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'heavy jersey leggings' has transitioned into the fall regime (effective Period 26), which is much higher than the summer trough. The most recent demand (Period 33) spiked to 126 units, significantly higher than the previous fall-regime average of ~91 units. This suggests we are entering peak fall seasonality or experiencing higher-than-expected volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 47 units on hand and 280 in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 8 periods (since the regime shift at P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this new higher-demand level while accounting for the recent spike. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 provides a forecast based on the mean demand of ~95 units/week since the fall shift, which translates to a total base stock requirement that accounts for the current upswing.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime shows increased volatility in late September (P33 demand: 126), potentially signaling a secondary peak or higher sustained demand than the initial Aug/Sept average of 91 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in its peak fall/back-to-school demand regime. Recent demand (P31-P34) has been 99, 85, 126, and 100, resulting in a 4-period average of 102.5 units. The most recent demand (P34: 100) led to a stockout as only 66 units were available on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand period ahead, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the start of the upward regime shift at P26) which results in a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units/week. Combined with L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 weeks of demand (~462 units). Current pipeline is 384 units, so the backend will order to close the gap to the base stock, accounting for the current stockout and high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand confirmed: P31-P34 average demand reach 102.5 units/week, a 14% increase over the early-fall average (90), suggesting sustained high demand through October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in its peak fall demand regime (mid-October). Recent demand data shows an average of 95.5 units/week over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), with a more recent 4-period average (P32-P35) of 94.5 units, though volatility is high (ranging from 67 to 126). Period 35 demand dropped to 67 units, but this follows a series of high-demand periods and may be a transient dip or a shift in stock availability. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 404 units, but on-hand stock is very low (7 units) due to high capture rates. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high criticality of maintaining service levels during the fall peak for this 'sturdy' jersey product, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the full fall regime average (~95.5) which projects to 477.5 for (L+1). I will use recent_N for sigma to account for the heightened volatility observed during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime (P26-P35) average is 95.5 units/week, with significant volatility (SD ~20). Demand is sustaining throughout October as expected for heavy jersey leggings.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Heavy jsy long leg' (189616006) is currently in its peak fall demand regime. For Period 37 (Oct 21), we observe that demand has slightly tapered from the late-September peak (126 units) but remains high, with an average of 95.5 units/week over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) and a more recent 4-period average (P33-P36) of 92 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (39 units), and we experienced a stockout in Period 34, indicating that the pipeline needs to be robust to meet the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level). I will use the recent Fall regime (last 11 samples, P26-P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it accurately reflects the current seasonal state compared to the earlier summer trough. This aligns the inventory base stock with the established Fall mean of approximately 92-95 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, nearing the end of October. Demand for 'heavy sturdy jersey' leggings is in its peak fall regime. The last 12 periods (P26-P37) show a mean of 92.5 units/week. Recent volatility is noted (SD ~18 over same period). Period 37 demand was 94 units, aligning with this regime. On-hand inventory is low (25), but pipeline is high (337). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are entering November, demand is expected to remain firm but might see early signs of cooling toward the end of the month as the pre-winter transition occurs. I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the full fall regime to avoid overreacting to individual week fluctuations while maintaining sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Peak demand regime (P26-P37) established a mean of 92.5 units/week with moderate-to-high volatility (SD ~18). This regime has successfully reversed the summer trough and is sustaining through late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the product ('heavy jersey leggings') is firmly in its peak fall/winter demand regime. Historical demand since Period 26 (August shift) has averaged approximately 93 units/week. More recently (P31-P38), demand has shown sustained strength with a mean of 91.1 and significant volatility (SD ~18), consistent with cold-weather fashion seasonality. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently 309 units, while on-hand inventory is 66 units. Given that the target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand, and expected demand is ~93 units/week, the target inventory is roughly 465 units. With 375 total units (on-hand + pipeline), an additional order is warranted. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the fall regime shift) to capture the current seasonal level while smoothing over the October fluctuations.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). We are in the late fall/early winter season for 'heavy jersey leggings'. Demand in Period 39 dropped to 54 units, the lowest since the fall regime began (P26). This could signal the start of a late-season taper or merely high volatility (P35-P39 mean is 74.2, SD 15.6). On-hand inventory is 106, with 294 in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (covering roughly 3.5 - 4 periods of demand) and the recent dip, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the potential downward trend in late autumn, while maintaining the recent variability for sigma_hat. This approach prevents over-ordering if the season is winding down while keeping safety stock for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand taper detected in Period 39 (54 units), representing a 30% drop from the late-fall average (~75-80).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'heavy sturdy jersey leggings' has shown a noticeable decline over the last two weeks (P39-P40), dropping to 54 units/week from a previous fall average of ~92 units. This aligns with a seasonal transition as the peak fall/back-to-school period ends and the market prepares for deep winter or holiday shifts. The pipeline inventory (241 units) plus on-hand (105 units) totals 346 units, which is high given the recent demand drop. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) to capture this downward trend (averaging ~63 units/week), while maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during season transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed at Period 40: 2-period average (P39-P40) is 54 units/week, a ~40% reduction from the fall peak average (~92), signaling the end of the fall/back-to-school regime for heavy jersey leggings.

Current date is 2019/11/25. Demand tapering identified in Period 41 is confirmed for a third consecutive week (P39-P41: 54, 54, 55). This represents a distinct downward shift from the fall peak (avg ~92) to a new early-winter regime of ~54 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 117 and 174 units in-transit (total pipeline of 291 units), and a current weekly demand of ~54, we have approximately 5.4 weeks of coverage. This exceeds the L+1 (5 weeks) target. To prevent inventory bloat during this seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current 54-55 unit regime, and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current lower volatility (SD ~0.6). The OR backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts to bleed off the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: Late November demand has stabilized at ~54 units/week (P39-P41), a 40% reduction from the fall peak (~92), signaling the transition to winter seasonality.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a significant demand jump to 129 units, contradicting the previous two-week trend of ~54 units. This spike likely represents Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late Nov/early Dec date context). Given that heavy jersey leggings are winter-appropriate, this may signal a transition from a late-fall taper into a sustained winter holiday regime rather than just a one-off spike. With 83 units on hand and 79 in transit (arriving over the next 4 periods), our total inventory of 162 is low if demand remains at the 100+ level. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this potential winter demand increase, using a recent_N of 4 to balance the recent taper and the new spike, essentially forecasting a mean around 73 units per week. I will maintain the default lead time of 4, which has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 42 (129 units) coincides with Black Friday/Cyber Monday; monitoring for sustained winter holiday demand regime versus one-off promotional event.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Period 42 showed a spike (129 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but Period 43 immediately returned to a lower level (46 units), confirming the spike was a transient promotional event rather than a sustained regime shift. The underlying winter demand regime appears to be approximately 50-55 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 116 units on-hand and 135 units in-transit (ordered Period 43), the pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 weeks of current demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=5 to capture the last 5 weeks of data (P39-P43: 54, 54, 55, 129, 46). This includes the holiday spike to ensure the OR backend maintains a safe inventory buffer against potential late-December volatility, while acknowledging the lower baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P39-P43) confirms a baseline of ~50 units/week with a transient holiday spike in P42. P43 demand (46) confirms the spike did not sustain.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th, transitioning from the post-Black Friday period into the late holiday/winter season. Demand has stabilized following the transient Black Friday spike (Period 42), with Recent_3 demand (P42-P44) averaging 73.3 units, but Period 43 and 44 alone average 45.5 units, which is consistent with the established winter baseline previously identified (~50 units). I will use a Recent_N approach for demand estimation with N=6 (Periods 39-44) to capture the winter regime and the spike, resulting in a mean of approximately 63.8 units/week. This balances the baseline and the risk of late December volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on game history. On-hand is 71 with 222 units in-transit (orders from P43 and P44), creating a pipeline of 293 units. Given the winter regime (50-60 units/week), this pipeline is sufficient to cover 4-5 weeks of demand. Parameters are set to maintain a stable service level without excessive holding costs, as the game nears its end in Period 47.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (Dec 16), we observed a massive demand spike of 356 units, which completely exhausted our on-hand inventory. This is highly likely a pre-Christmas/Boxing Day peak or a major seasonal clearance event for leggings. Despite this outlier, the underlying winter demand (excluding the Black Friday and this recent spike) has been roughly 45-50 units/week. However, we must account for the high volatility introduced by these holiday peaks. I will use a hybrid approach: L is stable at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P41-P45) to capture both the baseline and the massive spike, resulting in a significantly elevated mean to protect against further holiday volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the extreme variance. We currently have 0 on-hand and 249 in-transit; with demand averaging high due to the spike, we need to maintain a robust pipeline to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Extreme holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 45 (356 units), significantly exceeding previous Black Friday peaks; inventory exhausted.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616006 experienced a massive holiday demand surge in Period 45 (356 units) and Period 46 (180 units), exhausting on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current date is December 30, which is typically the end of the peak holiday shopping season and the start of post-holiday clearances or a return to baseline demand levels. Given the recent extreme volatility (SD jumped significantly) and the expected tapering of demand after the holidays, I am setting mu_hat using a 5-period average (N=5) to balance the extreme P45-P46 peaks with the pre-peak winter baseline (approx. 50 units). This prevents over-ordering in case the surge was purely transient, while acknowledging the current high pipeline (595 in-transit) that will begin arriving in Period 47 (from the P43 order). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (5) to capture the current high volatility for appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed for P45-P46: Demand spiked to 356 and 180 units respectively, significantly higher than the winter baseline of ~50. Monitoring for rapid tapering in January.
