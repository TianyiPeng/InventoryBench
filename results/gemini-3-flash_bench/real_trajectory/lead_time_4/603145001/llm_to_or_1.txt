Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product 'Angela hipster' is a staple cotton jersey underwear item. Historical demand (5 samples: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85) shows significant volatility with a mean of 54.2 units/week. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, an immediate order is necessary to cover the promised 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent high-demand signals (85, 85), while setting L to 'default' (promised 4 periods) as we have no actual lead-time observations yet. The mu_hat will be calculated by the backend as (1+4) * mean(59, 14, 28, 85, 85) = 5 * 54.2 = 271.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic underwear item (Angela hipster). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85. Period 1 demand was 91. The mean of these 6 observations (59, 14, 28, 85, 85, 91) is approximately 60.3. Since on-hand inventory started at 0 in Period 1 and the order placed in Period 1 (108 units) hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 4), sales in Period 1 were 0, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline currently contains 108 units. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of all available samples (n=6) to estimate future demand: average = 60.3 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat should be approximately (1+4) * 60.3 = 301.5. Sigma calculation: Standard deviation of {59, 14, 28, 85, 85, 91} is ~31.1. Sigma_hat should be sqrt(5) * 31.1 \u2248 69.5. I will use the 'default' method for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The current data shows zero sales because on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last two periods was 91 and 110, averaging 100.5. Historical samples for Jan/Feb (59, 14, 28, 85, 85) show a lower average (~54). There is a clear upward shift in demand coinciding with the transition into February/late Winter. Currently, 223 units are in transit (108 ordered P1, 115 ordered P2). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, P1's order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible at start of P6). Since we have no completed arrivals yet, we cannot confirm actual lead time; we stick with the 'default' (promised). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 2 periods (avg 100.5) are significantly higher than the distant past; I will use recent_N=5 (including the 3 most recent historical samples) to bridge the gap and capture the rising trend while maintaining some stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last few data points (85, 85, 91, 110).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Angela hipster' (Underwear) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. The history shows orders placed in Period 1 (108 units), Period 2 (115 units), and Period 3 (131 units) are all in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales as demand (91, 110, 111) has outpaced supply. Since the promised lead time is 4, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand samples (pre-game and game history) show a significant increase: pre-game mean was ~54, while the last three periods averaged ~104. Given this is basic underwear, demand is relatively stable but has shifted to a higher level recently. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime (avg 104 * (1+4) = 520) and sigma_hat to account for the volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: average demand increased from ~55 to ~104 (+89%) based on 3 consecutive periods of data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU '603145001' (Angela hipster) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (108 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 477 units are in transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (last 5: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85) and recent period demand (91, 110, 111, 63) show a clear shift. While Period 4 saw a dip (63), the previous three periods averaged ~104. Given the product is a staple 'Basics' item, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing the P4 volatility. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use N=4 to include the full range of the current high-demand regime since Feb 11. Lead time L is set to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Inventory analysis: Period 1's order of 108 units arrived in Period 5 (actual lead time = 4, matching promised). On-hand inventory is 16 units, with 404 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Demand Context: The historical demand samples (59, 14, 28, 85, 85) and game history demand (91, 110, 111, 63, 92) show a distinct shift. The average demand over the last 5 game periods is approximately 93.4 units, significantly higher than the initial pre-game samples. There was a slight dip in Period 4 (63), but Period 5 returned to 92. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture this higher volume regime while smoothing out the Period 4 noise. For lead time, I will stick to 'calculate' as the first arrival confirmed the promised 4-period lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is low (22), but we have 373 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand for the last 6 periods has been: 91, 110, 111, 63, 92, 109. The average demand since Period 1 is approximately 96 units per week. Although P4 was a dip (63), the surrounding weeks suggest a stable regime around 100. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the full active history since the start of the simulation, which reflects a higher demand regime than the pre-simulation samples. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target and place the order if the pipeline is insufficient.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a basic apparel item (Angela hipster). Historical lead time calculation from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms the actual lead time is exactly the promised 4 periods (108 units from P1 arrived P5, 115 from P2 arrived P6, and 131 from P3 arrived P7). Demand analysis: The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~104 units/period starting 2019-02-11. Reviewing recent demand (P1: 91, P2: 110, P3: 111, P4: 63, P5: 92, P6: 109, P7: 122), the average since Period 1 is 99.7. Excluding the outlier P4 (63), the average is 105.7. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. The inventory position is tight (31 on-hand) but significant stock is in-transit (362 units), which aligns with the (L+1) pipeline requirements for L=4. Maintaining the 'default' lead time of 4 is appropriate as it matches observations perfectly.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand since 2019-02-11 stabilized at an average of ~100 units/period (excluding P4 outlier).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), the demand for the Angela hipster SKU has shown a consistent upward movement, particularly in the most recent period (P8 demand was 149), compared to the previously established average of ~100. Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand has averaged 118 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 exactly 4 periods later. The system is currently in a high-demand regime, likely driven by seasonal factors for 'Basics' or promotional activity. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this rising trend (avg ~118/period) and use sigma_hat from the last 8 periods (all post-shift data) to account for volatility. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift upward observed from Period 5-8: average increased to 118 units/period, with a significant spike of 149 in Period 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Divided' cotton hipster brief, a staple item. Current date is April 15. We are experiencing a stockout after a lower-than-expected arrival in Period 9 (only 35 units from the Period 5 order arrived). Demand since Period 1 has averaged 104 units per period (Std Dev ~24). The last 3 periods (P7-P9) averaged 119 units, showing a recent upward trend as we move into spring. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and high pipeline inventory (496 units), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect the current demand regime to ensure future orders cover the L+1 window. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~112 from the last 5 periods (P5-P9: 92, 109, 122, 149, 87), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in this period (specifically the spike in P8). L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P5 stabilized at higher average (approx 112 units/period, +12% from initial shift) with increasing volatility.

Proceeding with Period 11 analysis. The current date is 2019/4/22. This SKU is a basic 'hipster brief'. Historical data shows a clear shift in demand around P5 (2019-02-11), with the post-shift average stabilizing around 104 units/period, excluding the P8 spike of 149 and the more recent lower values of 87 and 65 in P9-P10, which appear to be regressions toward the mean rather than a new downward shift. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods across five consecutive observations (P5 through P10 arrivals). In P9, we stocked out due to a low arrival (only 35 units from P5 order) coupled with low starting inventory, which underscores the need for a robust base stock. Since P5, demand samples are [92, 109, 122, 149, 87, 65]. The mean of these 6 samples is 104. Lead time L=4 is reliable. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (since P5) while ignoring the very low initial training data. For L, I will use the 'calculate' method as the history consistently confirms 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple underwear item (hipster briefs). Historical lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1 through P7. Demand has shown a regime shift since Period 1 (starting approx. 2019-02-11). Analyzing the last 7 periods (P5-P11), the average demand is approximately 105.7 units/period. The most recent demand (P11) was 116, aligning with the stabilized high-demand regime noted in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 437 units (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), with 132 units from P8 expected to arrive during the current period (P12). Given the stable lead time of 4, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand characteristics of the current regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations like the P8 spike (149) and P10 dip (65).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) shows a relatively stable demand regime since the initial increase in mid-February. Over the last 8 periods (P5-P12), demand has averaged approximately 106 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 25. The most recent three periods (P10-P12) show mean demand around 100 units. To balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.8), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using N=8 to reflect the current volatility levels. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12), so the lead time parameter remains at default. Current on-hand is low (36), but significant in-transit inventory (425) covers about 4 periods of demand, suggesting the OR backend will place moderate orders to maintain the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 5 stabilized: mean = 106 units/period, std ~ 25 units. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a staple item (hipster briefs) with a stable lead time of 4 periods (confirmed through P13). On-hand inventory is 77, and total in-transit is 390. Demand has stabilized around a new regime that started at Period 5. Calculating demand stats from Period 5 to Period 13 (9 samples): Mean = (92+109+122+149+87+65+116+119+119)/9 = 108.6 units. Standard deviation in this period is approximately 25. Given the high stockout risk seen in Period 9 and the recent consistent demand around 119 in the last three periods, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this stable high-demand regime. Lead time remains default (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $667.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). The product is a staple underwear item ('Angela hipster'). Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift after Period 5 (2019-03-11), with mean demand increasing from ~54 to ~107. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 9 separate delivery observations (P1 through P10 orders). Period 14 saw a significant demand spike to 171 units, though the average from P5-P14 remains around 107. Since demand is currently elevated and volatility has increased (\u03c3 \u2248 30 in the recent regime), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation accurately, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations for the (L+1) horizon reflect the post-shift behavior. The pipeline is full (402 units), and the order scheduled to arrive in Period 15 is from Period 11 (34 units), which should cover expected demand given the current on-hand of 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed Period 14 (171 units), but the 10-period regime (P5-P14) remains stable with a mean of ~107 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we faced a stockout situation where demand (137) exceeded our available on-hand inventory (51). This was due to the small arrival of only 34 units (from the Period 11 order). Since the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, we are currently waiting for the Period 12 order (120 units) to arrive in Period 16. However, our on-hand inventory is currently 0. The demand regime from Period 5 through 15 shows a steady average of approximately 109.8 units per period, but recent demand (P14: 171, P15: 137) suggests an upward trend or higher volatility as we enter late May. To respond to this, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the entire current regime since Period 5) to capture the stabilized mean of ~110 while acknowledging the recent spikes. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=11 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased variance seen in recent periods (std \u2248 30). This will help set a base stock level that prevents future stockouts if demand remains elevated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 5 (start of arrivals) has stabilized at a mean of 110 units/period (P5-P15), but volatility increased significantly in P14-P15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' is currently experiencing stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 for the last two periods) due to a sustained upward demand shift. Mean demand from Period 5 to Period 16 is approximately 114 units, but the most recent three periods (P14-P16) have averaged 156 units, indicating a potential summer/seasonal peak for this cotton hipster brief. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a pipeline of 520 units (covering Periods 13-16 orders), I need to set parameters to recover from the stockout and handle this higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=12 to capture the stabilized mean since arrivals began (P5), but I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand spike (approx 135 units/period) to ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock (135 * (1 + 4) = 675). I will use the last 12 periods for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed since the end of April.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 14-16 average demand rose to 156 units (+40% vs P5-P13 average of 111), likely reflecting seasonal summer demand for cotton underwear. Lead time remains constant at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton hipster underwear) is experiencing a sustained demand increase as we enter the summer season. In the last four periods (P14-P17), demand values were 171, 137, 160, and 129, resulting in an average of 149.25 units/period. This represents a significant step up from the previous mean of ~110. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has stocked out in the last three consecutive periods, indicating that we are under-forecasting current requirements. While the promised lead time is 4 periods, history confirms arrivals consistently occur at L=4. To adjust to this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the new average (approx 150/period), which translates to a total look-ahead demand (1+L) of roughly 750 units. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition into summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained summer demand regime confirmed: Period 14-17 average demand is 149 units/period, a significant increase from the previous baseline of 110. Stockouts in P15, P16, and P17 confirm inventory levels are insufficient for current demand levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton hipster underwear) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Since Period 14 (May 13), demand has consistently challenged stock levels, resulting in stockouts in Period 15, 16, and 17. Period 18 saw a slight cooling (117 units), but the average since Period 14 remains high at approximately 143 units/period (P14-P18: 171, 137, 160, 129, 117). Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. To account for the sustained summer demand and elevated volatility (std ~19), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher baseline, while maintaining a default sigma to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation covers the observed variance. Pipeline inventory is currently 643 units, including large orders from P17 and P18 (186 and 185 units) which will arrive in Periods 21 and 22.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P14-P18) mean stabilized at ~143 units/period, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in the summer demand regime (P14-P19). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. While P18-P19 saw moderate demand (117, 101), the preceding weeks (P14-P17) showed significantly higher demand (avg ~149), likely due to seasonal effects on this cotton jersey product. We have 70 units on-hand and 616 units in-transit (reflecting recent large orders to combat frequent stockouts in P15-P17). To maintain service levels given high volatility (std dev ~25-30), I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=6 to capture the current summer regime while accounting for the recent moderation in demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer demand regime for this SKU (Angela hipster). In Period 20, demand dropped significantly to 60 units, following a trend of gradual decline from the peak in mid-May/June (Period 14-17). Period 19 demand was 101, and Period 20 was 60. This drop suggests that the peak summer spike may be subsiding; however, the carry-over insights and historical averages for the summer period (P14-P20) still average approximately 125 units per period. Using a recent_N approach (N=7 covers the summer data) for mu_hat will capture this elevated but now volatile demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 117, and pipeline is high at 552, largely due to high orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 to compensate for previous stockouts. The OR backend needs to balance the risk of overstocking if the demand drop in P20 continues, while maintaining a service level for the remainder of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P19-P20; P20 saw a sharp decline to 60 units, potentially signaling the end of the peak summer demand spike (previously ~143 units/period).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P20: 60, P21: 57) confirms a significant shift away from the summer peak (previously ~143 units/period) back to a lower baseline. This aligns with the end of the peak summer retail period for this cotton underwear item. I am implementing a demand regime change starting from Period 20. For mu_hat, I'm using N=3 (P19, P20, P21) to capture this downshift quickly while retaining one higher period (P19=101) to avoid under-ordering if demand stabilizes slightly higher than the last two weeks. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 21 arrival (ordered P17, arrived P21). Current on-hand inventory (246) and in-transit (393) are high relative to the new demand level (approx 73 units average over last 3 periods), so the OR backend will likely scale back orders to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 20 (2019-06-24): average demand dropped significantly to ~58 units/period (P20-P21) from the summer peak of ~143 units, indicating the end of the seasonal high.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the cotton jersey hipster briefs has entered a new lower-volume regime following the end of the summer seasonal peak. Data from Period 20 to Period 22 shows demand values of 60, 57, and 77, resulting in a mean of approximately 65 units/period. This represents a significant decrease from the summer average of ~143 and the previous baseline of ~110. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (354 units) relative to this new demand level, and there are still 208 units in-transit (orders from P19-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs given the surplus and the current low demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-peak mean and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current volatility. This configuration will signal the OR backend that existing inventory and pipeline are sufficient, likely resulting in zero or minimal orders until the surplus is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 20-22 mean demand dropped to ~65 units/period (approx -55% from summer peak), indicating the conclusion of seasonal high demand for cotton jersey underwear.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Angela hipster (603145001) has transitioned from a summer peak (~143 units/period) to a significantly lower post-peak regime. Data from Periods 20-23 (60, 57, 77, 43) shows a stable mean of approximately 59.25 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (449) plus in-transit (70) totals 519 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 296 units. Since the current pipeline (519) significantly exceeds this requirement, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to accurately catch the downward shift and keep L at default (4). The backend OR engine will naturally suppress new orders until the excess inventory is depleted, minimizing further holding costs while maintaining the target service level for the new, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for cotton jersey underwear confirmed (Period 20-23): mean demand dropped to ~59 units/period (-59% from summer peak).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' cotton jersey underwear has clearly entered a post-summer regime. Following a peak of ~143 units/period in May/June, demand has consistently dropped over the last five periods (P20-P24). The demand figures for these periods are 60, 57, 77, 43, and 82, resulting in a new mean of approximately 64 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently very high (410 units) due to large orders placed during the summer peak arriving just as demand fell. This inventory level already covers several periods of the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower demand and prevent further overstocking, which would incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit). Given the high on-hand inventory, the OR backend will naturally minimize or zero out new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P24) mean stabilized at ~64 units/period, a ~55% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' cotton jersey underwear has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Since Period 20 (late June), demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~143 units/period) to a new mean of approximately 66 units/period (average Table P20-P25: 60, 57, 77, 43, 82, 75). On-hand inventory is currently very high (362 units) due to arrivals from large orders placed during the summer peak (Periods 17-19). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the next 5 periods (L+1), as 362 on-hand / 66 demand \u2248 5.5 periods of coverage. Consequently, no new orders have been triggered for several periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this lower-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies that existing stock is sufficient to meet the service level without further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P25) stabilized at a mean of ~66 units/period with moderate volatility (std ~14).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Angela hipster (cotton jersey underwear) has stabilized in its post-summer regime. Since Period 20 (2019-06-24), demand has averaged 60.3 units per period (samples: 60, 57, 77, 43, 82, 75, 28). The current on-hand inventory is 334 units, and there are no units in transit. With a promised and confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Our current inventory (334) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (approximately 300 units based on the recent average), meaning the OR backend will correctly order 0 units to reduce excess holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer demand regime while ignoring the previous high-demand summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P26) mean demand further stabilized at ~60 units/period (down from ~66), showing lower late-summer volatility compared to initial transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey underwear) has stabilized into a post-summer low-demand regime starting from Period 20 (late June). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P20-P27) is approximately 54 units/period, with the most recent two weeks (P26-P27) dropping further to ~29 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (305 units) is extremely high relative to these demand levels, equivalent to over 10 weeks of stock at current rates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and significant holding cost ($1/unit), the priority remains to deplete existing stock. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the post-summer trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it is consistent. The OR backend will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P27) further stabilized at a lower mean of 54 units/period (compared to initial estimate of 60), with a notable drop to ~29 units in the most recent two periods (P26-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Angela hipster (cotton jersey underwear) has entered a sustained low-traffic regime following the summer peak. Analysis of the period since Period 20 shows a clear downward trend, with the most recent three periods (P26-P28) averaging only 25.3 units. The 'Post-summer' regime (P20-P28) now averages 52.2 units, significantly lower than previous estimates. On-hand inventory is currently very high (286 units) relative to this demand level, covering over 5 periods of forecasted demand without considering the 17 units in transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the priority is to draw down existing stock. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift from P20) to reflect the current 52-unit average, while sigma_hat will use N=5 to capture the more stabilized, lower volatility seen in the last 5 weeks. L remains default (4 periods). This setup will result in zero or minimal orders until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P28) mean further stabilized at 52 units/period (compared to initial estimate of 60), with a notable sustained drop in the most recent three periods (avg 25).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 30 (September 2) continues the post-summer decline. Analyzing the demand from Period 20 (late June transition) to Period 29, there is a clear downward progression as the seasonal relevance of the cotton jersey underwear fades. The most recent 4 periods (P26-P29) show significantly lower demand (28, 29, 19, 21) with a mean of 24.25 and a standard deviation of 4.99. Comparative to the initial post-summer regime (P20-P25) which averaged ~66, the current trend (P26-P29) suggests a stabilized lower baseline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this localized stable low. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 265 units on-hand and only 31 in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to the current demand (~24/period); however, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally prevent unnecessary new orders while we bleed off excess inventory to minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further downward starting Period 26: mean demand for P26-P29 is 24.25 units/period (-50% from previous post-summer estimate of ~50-60).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 (cotton jersey hipster briefs) has entered a significant downward trend following the summer peak. The current period is 2019-09-09. Since Period 26, the demand has stabilized at a much lower level, with the last four periods (P26-P29) showing demand of 28, 29, 19, 21, and 16. The most recent five periods (P26-P30) average approximately 22.6 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high at 249 units, which is more than 10 times the current weekly demand, while the pipeline inventory contains 31 units (orders from P27-P29). Given the low demand and high inventory, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime (approx 22.6 units/period), resulting in a base stock level that prevents new orders from being triggered until the existing excess inventory is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey underwear) has transitioned into a late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 26 (early August), demand has consistently remained low, averaging 18.75 units per period over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). The current on-hand inventory of 233 units is extremely high relative to this new demand level, covering over 12 periods of sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P27 order arriving in P31. Given the excessive on-hand inventory and the low demand mean (~20 units/period), no new orders are necessary. Parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 6 periods (N=6, covering the shift from ~60 to ~20) to reflect the currently depressed demand while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. L is set to default as lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime confirmed (P26 onwards): mean demand has dropped to approximately 19 units/period, down from the previous post-summer estimate of ~60 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) is currently in a late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 26, the demand has significantly dropped from the post-summer average (~60 units) to a much lower level. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P26-P32) shows demand values of 28, 29, 19, 21, 16, 21, and 19. This results in a stabilized mean of approximately 21.8 units/period with low volatility. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 226 units, which is exceptionally high relative to the current demand (~10 periods of coverage). There are 14 units in transit (ordered P29) arriving in Period 33. Given the Lead Time (L=4) and high current inventory, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend acknowledges the significantly reduced base stock requirement, preventing further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' has entered a late-season low-demand regime. Starting from Period 26 (2019-08-05), the weekly demand has consistently stayed below 30 units, with the exception of a jump to 52 units in the most recent Period 33. This spike in P33 might be a minor outlier or a final clearance-related surge, but the broader trend since P26 remains significantly lower than the summer peak. The current on-hand inventory of 188 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 5 periods * 20-30 units = 100-150 units). Given there are no units in transit and current stock is high, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent N samples (N=8, covering P26-P33) to accurately reflect this lower demand regime. This will prevent unnecessary ordering while the system works through existing overstock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime (P26-P33) remains low with a mean of approx 24.5 units/period, despite a single-period spike to 52 in P33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey underwear) has entered a late-season trough. Since Period 26, demand has consistently fluctuated around a much lower mean compared to the summer peak and the initial post-summer period. The last 9 periods (P26-P34) show a mean demand of 25.8 units/period. While P33 saw a spike to 52, P34 returned to 27, suggesting the spike was an outlier or a minor temporary fluctuation rather than a regime shift. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P27, P28, and P29 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). With 161 units on-hand and 0 in-transit (pipeline), and a projected demand of ~26 units/period, the current inventory covers over 6 periods of demand (161 / 25.8 \u2248 6.2), which exceeds the required protection interval of (L+1) = 5 periods. Therefore, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this late-season behavior while excluding the higher-demand summer/early-autumn periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime (P26-P34) stabilized at a mean of ~26 units/period, significantly lower than previous months. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a late-season/low-demand regime following the summer peak. Since Period 26 (2019-08-05), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 25.5 units per period (P26-P35 inclusive). In the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has been even lower, averaging 27.4 including one outlier of 52 in P33 and multiple values below 20. On-hand inventory is currently 143 units with zero in-transit. With an average demand of ~26 units, the current stock is sufficient to cover more than 5 periods of demand (approx 5.5 periods), which exceeds the (L+1) requirement of 5 periods (Lead time L=4 + 1). Consequently, despite the holding cost, no new order is necessary to maintain service levels. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31, P32, P33). I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this lower late-season demand pattern (P26-P35) while maintaining lead time at the promised default of 4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) is in a stable late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted significantly downward to approximately 26 units/period, compared to the summer peak of ~143. Most recent data (P33-P36) shows slightly more volatility (52, 27, 18, 36), but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is 107 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand at the observed mean of ~26. With a lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At 26 units/period, the required base stock is roughly 130 units. Given the current 107 on-hand and 2 in-transit (total 109), the system will likely place a small replenishment order. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=11, covering P26-P36) and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the current low-demand stability while accounting for recent late-season fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime (P26-P36) mean remains stable at ~26 units/period with occasional volatility (e.g., P33 spike to 52). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' cotton underwear remains in its late-season regime, which has stabilized significantly since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 through Period 37, the mean is approximately 27.6 units per period. While there was a spike in P33 (52) and a slight upward trend in the last two periods (36 and 44), the overall volume is low compared to the summer peak. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 63 with 43 units in-transit (ordered P36 and P37). Given a lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an expected demand of ~28/period, the target base stock is approximately 140 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 63 + in-transit 43 = 106) is slightly below this target. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full late-season regime and its characteristic spikes, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer for the recent slight increase in demand while accounting for the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 (cotton jersey hipster) is currently in a late-season/low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized into a much lower regime compared to the summer peak. Since Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 27 units per period, with occasional spikes (like the 52 in Period 33 and 44 in Period 37). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (38) is low relative to the lead time coverage needed (L+1 = 5 periods). With an in-transit pipeline of 90 units (ordered in P36, P37, P38), we are essentially waiting for arrivals to bridge the gap. For Period 39, I am setting mu_hat using the last 13 periods (since the major post-summer drop in P26) to capture the current stable low-demand regime (~27/period) while ignoring the irrelevant summer peaks. Sigma_hat is also set on this recent window to account for the current volatility levels, ensuring the OR backend balances the relatively high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4) with an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime (P26-P38) stabilized at a mean of ~27 units/period with moderate volatility, significantly lower than previous months. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late-season/autumn demand regime for cotton jersey underwear. Since Period 26 (August 5), demand has significantly dropped from summer peaks, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 27 units per period. Recent data (P37-P39) shows some variability (44, 25, 11), but the underlying regime remains consistent with late-year seasonality. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (e.g., P31, P32, P33). We have 27 units on hand and 119 in transit. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P36-P39 that are expected to arrive in P40-P43. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (like the P33 spike to 52), I am using a recent_N of 14 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend since mid-August, and recent_N of 14 for volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the OR backend with the current low-demand environment while accounting for the ~25% standard deviation observed in this regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is currently in a late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 26, demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~143 units) to a stable mean of approximately 26-27 units/period. The most recent five periods (P36-P40) show a mean of 25.8 units, confirming this low-demand state despite minor fluctuations. Lead time is reliably confirmed as 4 periods (P36 order arrived in P40). Pipeline inventory is currently 123 units (sum of orders from P37-P40), which is ample to cover several periods of the current demand rate (~26 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the high 'in-transit' volume relative to current demand, the priority is to avoid overstocking while maintaining a protective base. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 15 periods to capture this late-season baseline and use a standard sigma estimate for volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) is in a late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized around ~26 units/period. The most recent five periods (P37-P41) show an even lower average of 20.8 units per period (44, 25, 11, 13, 11), indicating a further cooldown as we approach December. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P36->P40, P37->P41). Current on-hand is 46 units, and in-transit is 91 units (orders from P38: 47, P39: 29, P40: 6, P41: 9). Total pipeline (137) is already very high relative to the (L+1=5) period demand forecast (approx 5 * 21 = 105 units). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for late-season variability. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand cooldown confirmed: P37-P41 demand average further decreased to ~21 units/period compared to the previous P26-P36 average of ~26.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is currently in a late-season/winter cooldown phase. Demand has stabilized significantly lower since Period 37, with an average demand of approximately 16.2 units/period over the last 5 periods (P38-P42: 25, 11, 13, 11, 21). This is consistent with the 'late-season demand cooldown' noted in the Period 42 carry-over insight. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P36, P37, and P38 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 72 units, and 44 units are in-transit (P39: 29, P40: 6, P41: 9). Given the low demand regime, current inventory (72) plus expected arrivals (29 + 6 + 9 = 44) total 116 units, which is roughly 7 periods of coverage at the current mean demand of ~16. The OR backend needs to maintain a service level balance where profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) gives a critical ratio of 0.8, targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the sustained low demand since late October, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P42) stabilized at a mean of ~16 units/period, down from the previous late-season average of ~26.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-09 (Period 44), nearing the end of the simulation (Period 47). We are in a confirmed winter demand regime (starting around P38) where average demand has dropped to approximately 16 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P39-P43) are 11, 13, 11, 21, and 9, reinforcing this low-demand state. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P40, P41, P42, and P43. On-hand inventory is currently 92 units, which is quite high relative to the ~16 units/period demand, covering more than 5 periods of forecasted demand. Pipeline inventory is 28 units (from P40, P41, and P43). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation and the high inventory level, the goal is to prevent overstocking while maintaining a buffer. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the winter slowdown (P38-P43 mean is ~15 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the lower volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P43) remains stable at a mean of ~15 units/period, significantly lower than the autumn baseline (~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey underwear) has entered a stable winter low. From Period 38 to 44, demand has consistently been low, with the most recent three periods (P42-P44) averaging only 12.33 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 43/44 confirms a winter regime mean of ~15 units/period. Current on-hand inventory (91) plus in-transit stock (22) totals 113 units. Given the projected demand of ~15 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the inventory needed is approximately 75-90 units. Since we already have 113 units in the pipeline/on-hand, we are overstocked for the current demand level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this winter regime (P38-P44) and sigma_hat using the same N to reflect the low volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 45 (2019-12-16) was 76 units, which is a sharp spike compared to the winter average of ~15 units. Given the date is mid-December, this is likely a holiday-related surge for 'Angela hipster' cotton underwear. However, as the next decision period is December 23rd, demand is expected to drop off immediately following the holiday peak (a common retail pattern). Pipeline inventory is low (13 units in-transit from Period 43), but on-hand inventory is 24. Acknowledging the spike in P45, I will not treat it as a new regime but rather a seasonal outlier. For parameters, I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture the winter baseline while including the recent spike to provide slight protection against residual holiday demand, and use 'calculate' for lead time since it has been stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 45 demand reached 76 units, significantly higher than the winter baseline of ~15 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) is experiencing a sharp seasonal holiday/winter spike. Demand in Period 45 (Dec 16) was 76 units and Period 46 (Dec 23) was 97 units, significantly exceeding the previous winter baseline of ~15 units. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P41 arrived in P45, P40 in P44). In-transit inventory is 73 units (60 units from P46 + 13 units from P43). Given the current date of 2019/12/30, we are at the tail end of the holiday season but must bridge the gap until the P46 order arrives in P50. The OR backend needs to account for this elevated regime. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the sudden spike (avg ~60, including the lead-in) and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the high volatility during this transition. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' based on its high consistency.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed starting Period 45: Significant spike observed (P45=76, P46=97) compared to previous winter baseline of ~15. Stockout occurred in P46 due to this surge.
