Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Cat Tee' t-shirt. Historical data from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a stable demand mean of 39.4 (range 35-42). As it is early February, we are moving away from the post-holiday lull and entering a period where basic jersey t-shirts typically see stable or slightly increasing demand. Promised lead time is 4. Since we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which leverage the 5 available historical samples (N=5). This calculates mu_hat as (1+4) * 39.4 = 197 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4) * 2.96 = 6.62. This conservative statistical start ensures the OR backend initiates an order to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review cycle (L+1=5 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Jersey T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions into spring. Historical demand (last 5 weeks: 42, 40, 35, 42, 38) shows a mean of 39.4. In Period 1, observed demand was 32, which is slightly lower but within normal variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (45 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). The target service level is high (profit $4 vs holding $1). I will use the mean of available historical samples (N=6, including P1 demand) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time L is set to 'default' as we have no evidence yet to deviate from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This SKU is a basic Jersey T-shirt. On-hand inventory is 0, with 90 units in transit (45 ordered in P1, 45 ordered in P2). Historical demand samples show a mean of 39.4 (42, 40, 35, 42, 38). Observational demand in P1 (32) and P2 (51) averages 41.5, suggesting demand is relatively stable but currently outstrips available stock due to the lead time. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, the first order (P1) is not expected to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of P6). There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. Given the service level target (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (incorporating the 5 provided historical samples + 2 observed periods) to capture the standard baseline. \u03bc\u0302 will be set to (1+L) * mean, which the OR backend handles.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 35-42 units (Jan). In the last 3 periods (Feb), demand has increased significantly: 32, 51, 61 (average ~48). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 141 units in-transit from orders in P1 (45), P2 (45), and P3 (51). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because we are only at Period 4, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5, visible in P6). Demand is trending upward as we move towards spring/summer. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the recent Feb demand trend (avg 48). With L=4, mu_hat = (1+L) * avg_demand = 5 * 48 = 240. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock and place an order to bridge the gap between (on-hand + in-transit) and the target.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, according to the 'L=4' rule, it should arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which we will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 214 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (before the game) averaged ~39.4, while in-game demand (P1-P4) has averaged 47.75, showing a slight upward trend as spring approaches. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on recent in-game demand to account for this slight increase, and keep L at the promised value since no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead-time shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing a 'Cat Tee' (Divided Basics). The date is 2019-03-18. Looking at the history, the first order placed in Period 1 (45 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand is 1 unit. We have 217 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Demand for the last 5 periods has been 32, 51, 61, 47, 44 (mean ~47). The initial seed data (Jan-Feb) showed demand around 35-42. We are seeing a slight uptick in demand moving into March, likely a seasonal shift as 'Divided Basics' jersey t-shirts are spring/summer items. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent range (P1-P5). Lead time (L) is confirmed at the default 4. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a basic T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 0, with 209 in-transit. Demand has shown a significant spike in Period 6 (84 units) compared to the previous average (approx 45 units), likely driven by the transition into spring. I am setting L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (averaging 64 over the last 3 periods), ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for this shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 6: demand increased significantly to 84 (+80% vs avg 1-5). Monitoring for sustained spring seasonality.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has surged significantly: Period 6 saw 84 units and Period 7 saw 150 units, compared to an early average of 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, despite arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 253 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), with P4's order of 73 units expected to arrive this period (visible next period). Given the sharp upward trend (84 to 150 in two weeks), I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast. I estimate a base weekly demand of 160 units (accounting for the growth from 150) across the review+lead window (1+4=5 periods), totaling 800. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Period 7 demand (150) is ~3x the initial average. Aggressive stocking required for Spring T-shirt peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/04/08). We are managing a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand spike as we enter the Spring/Summer season. Historical demand for the last 3 periods (P6-P8) has been 84, 150, and 118, with an average of approximately 117.3, compared to the initial baseline of ~45. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (confirmed by P5-P8 arrivals). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 429 units in-transit (orders from P5: 48, P6: 37, P7: 95, P8: 249). The P5 order (48 units) is expected to arrive this period (P9), which is insufficient for the current demand level (~117). We need to maintain aggressive parameters to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to cover the (L+1) = 5 period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (April 15). The item is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), and we are in the middle of a seasonal demand surge that started in mid-March. Since Period 6, demand has been significantly higher: 84, 150, 118, and 64 (average ~104) compared to the initial five-week average of ~45. Although Period 9 saw a drop to 64, it remains higher than the baseline. April is a peak period for jersey basics. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 553 units in-transit. To ensure we don't under-order during this volatile spring season, I will use a recent_N window for demand and volatility to capture the higher sales regime. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the data since the regime shift at Period 6.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (Late April), managing a 'Cat Tee' t-shirt. The historical data confirms a significant seasonal surge starting in late March (Period 7), which is typical for spring/summer apparel. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 7, the average weekly demand has been approximately 99.6 units (150, 118, 64, 66), compared to the earlier average of ~45. The recent dip to 64-66 suggests the peak may be stabilizing, but we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Large orders placed in Periods 8 and 9 (249 and 172 units) are due to arrive in Periods 12 and 13 respectively, which will resolve the stock-out. For this period's parameters, I will use a window of the last 5 samples to capture the heightened spring demand regime while acknowledging the recent slight cooldown. I'll maintain L=4 (promised) as it matches the observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for T-shirts remains active but appears to be stabilizing post-peak; average demand since Period 7 is ~100 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late April (2019/4/29), managing a soft jersey T-shirt. Historical lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The 'Spring peak' saw demand jump from ~40 to a high of 150 (Period 7), but it has since moderated. Demand over the last five periods (P7-P11) was 150, 118, 64, 66, and 76, averaging approximately 95 units/week. However, the last three weeks suggest a stabilization around 68-76 units. Given the seasonality of T-shirts, demand is likely to remain steady or slightly increase as summer approaches. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (94.8 units/week) to capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5 * 94.8 = 474. On-hand + In-transit (19 + 460 = 479) is currently sufficient to cover this expected demand, so the OR backend should trigger a minimal or zero order this period, preventing overstocking as the peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized post-Spring peak (P7): Average demand for the last 3 periods is 68.6 units/week, down from the peak of 150 in Period 7.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', which experienced a significant demand surge during the Spring peak (Periods 7-8). As observed in recent periods (P10-P12), demand has stabilized from its triple-digit highs to a range of 66-76 units per week. The average demand of the last 3 periods is exactly 72.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With 192 units on hand and 278 in transit, the inventory position is strong (470 units). I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand level (~72.6 * 5 = 363). This ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the current demand regime without being skewed by the outlier Spring peak or the very low pre-season values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized at Period 12: demand has remained consistent (avg 72.6) for three consecutive periods (P10-P12) following the Spring peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 14 (mid-May). The demand history shows a clear Spring peak in late March/early April (P7-P8) that has since subsided. Recent demand in P11-P13 (76, 76, 39) indicates the market is returning to a baseline level after the seasonal surge. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 63.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1 through P9 arrivals all confirmed L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (325 units) due to the large P8/P9 orders arriving after the peak. In-transit inventory is 106 units (consisting of orders from P10 and P12). Given the high on-hand stock and declining demand, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stabilizing demand and prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the current L=4 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~100 to ~64 units over the last 3 periods (P11-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a significant Spring demand surge. Demand peaked at 150 units in Period 7 and has since trended downwards, settling into a lower range. History shows demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) was 76, 39, and 54 respectively, averaging 56.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high (310 units) due to aggressive ordering during the peak arriving now (172 units in P13, 39 units in P14). With 310 units on hand and 67 units in-transit (ordered in P12), total pipeline inventory (377) far exceeds current demand projections for the 5-period lead time cycle (L=4). Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the stabilized, lower demand regime (mean ~61 since P11), allowing the OR backend to stop ordering and bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which experienced a significant spring peak between late March and mid-April (P7-P8). Since then, demand has stabilized. The last 3 periods (P13-P15) show demand values of 39, 54, and 63, averaging 52 units/week. This confirms the downward trend from the earlier post-peak average of 64 noted in the Period 14 carry-over. We are currently holding significant inventory (247 on-hand + 67 in-transit = 314 total) relative to this stabilized demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period demand average to allow the OR backend to recalculate the inventory required, likely resulting in no new orders until the current surplus is depleted, avoiding further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a post-spring-peak regime; average demand from P13-P15 is 52 units/week, a further ~18% decrease from the P11-P13 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (Date: 2019/6/3), we are entering the summer season for T-shirts. Historical lead time is consistent at 4 periods. While demand stabilized post-spring-peak (approx. 50-60 units), Period 16 saw a notable spike to 108 units, potentially signaling the start of early summer demand. However, current on-hand inventory is high (206 units) due to aggressive stocking during the spring peak, and there is no pipeline inventory (in-transit: 0). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we have over 3 weeks of supply at the current 60-unit average (or ~2 weeks if demand stays at 108), the OR backend will likely not place an order. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the recent range of 39 to 108 (avg ~66), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 16. This provides a balanced base stock to cover demand across the lead time without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Potential start of summer demand regime; demand increased to 108 in Period 16 after a period of stabilization (~60 units). Monitoring if Period 16 is an outlier or a new trend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which is highly seasonal. The demand in Period 16 (108) and Period 17 (84) indicates a significant upward shift from the post-spring average of ~55. This aligns with the transition into the summer peak season for basic jersey T-shirts. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods across all successful arrivals (Period 5-14, 16). On-hand inventory is 122 units, and there is 115 units in-transit (ordered in Period 17). To capture this summer growth and avoid stockouts, I am applying a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on the last two high-demand weeks (mean demand = 96). Given the volatility observed during seasonal shifts (from 108 to 84), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the increased standard deviation during this transition. This should set a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) during the summer ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Average demand for Period 16-17 is 96, up ~75% from the previous 3-period average (~55).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/17. Demand for SKU 717490002 (Cotton T-shirt) has shifted back into a higher regime as we enter the peak summer months. After a post-Spring stabilization around 60 units/week, the last three periods (P16-P18) have seen demands of 108, 84, and 72, averaging 88 units/week. This represents a significant increase from the previous average of ~55. On-hand inventory is falling (50 units), and while there is a large pipeline (249 units), the next major arrival (115 units from Period 17) is not expected until Period 21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels during this summer upturn, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this recent summer demand trend, and doing the same for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the mid-year peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The product is a basic T-shirt in soft jersey, which is currently in its peak 'Summer' demand season. We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) due to a surge in demand and a previous gap in ordering. History confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in periods 5-14 and 16). The order from Period 17 is expected to arrive during the next period (Period 20 conclude, visible at P21), meaning we must survive Period 20's demand with current pipeline. Demand has intensified since Period 16: P16 (108), P17 (84), P18 (72), P19 (100). The average for this recent summer regime (P16-P19) is 91 units per week. Given the seasonal nature and continuing summer heat, I will project this mean forward. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher summer average while maintaining the default 4-period lead time for safety.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P19): Average demand has reached 91 units/week, up significantly from the post-Spring trough (~60). High stockout risk detected due to lean pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1) finds the SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) in the midst of a sustained summer demand regime. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in stockouts since arriving units have not yet hit the floor. The orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (totalling 486 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive sequentially starting this period (P17's 115 units arrive in P21). Demand analysis for the summer regime (P16-P20) shows an average demand of 93.8 units/week (108, 84, 72, 100, 105). To capture this higher demand and account for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this 90+ units/week level. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 470 units, matching both the current pipeline and the summer run rate, while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (started P16) has maintained a high average of ~94 units/week through Period 20, requiring higher safety stock levels compared to the May trough (~60 units/week).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 is a soft jersey T-shirt, which is currently experiencing a massive summer demand spike, as evidenced by Period 21's demand of 393 units (a ~4x increase from the recent summer average of ~94). July often sees peaks for jersey basics due to high summer heat and vacation shopping. I currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 383 units in-transit. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 17 order arrived in Period 21). However, the sudden demand explosion to 393 units creates an immediate stockout risk and requires a significant increase in mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the 393 units could be a one-time spike or the start of a peak-July surge, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (approx 167 units/week) scaled for (1+L) to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture remaining summer demand while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering if the 393 was a pure outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Massive demand spike in Period 21 (393 units), likely representing a peak summer/seasonal surge for T-shirts. Mean demand shifted from ~94 to ~167 over the last 4 periods (P18-P21).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) is currently experiencing a major summer demand surge. Period 21 saw a massive spike to 393 units, and Period 22 maintained high demand at 264 units. The average demand over the last two periods is 328.5 units, which is a significant departure from the previous summer average of ~94. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and the pipeline inventory of 640 units is mostly composed of the recent large order (391 units from P22), which won't arrive until Period 26. To capture this peak and avoid further lost sales while balancing holding costs for when the surge inevitably cools, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P20-P22) which includes the run-up and the peak (avg: 254). Sigma_hat is set using the same period to reflect the high volatility of this seasonal peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed at P21: Huge demand surge (393 in P21, 264 in P22) indicates a mid-July seasonal peak for T-shirts, significantly higher than the initial summer regime (avg ~94).

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which is currently at its seasonal peak (mid-July). Period 23 demand dropped to 74, but this follows a massive surge in P21-P22 (393 and 264 units). The current period (P24, July 22) is still within the high-summer window. The decline in P23 might be a temporary fluctuation or the start of a post-peak cooling, but given the previous two weeks, we must remain defensive against high demand to avoid stockouts. The actual lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since P21, the market has entered a highly volatile regime. I will use a 3-period average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the surge (393, 264, 74), which equals ~243.6 units/week. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the high risks of the current seasonal window while acknowledging the most recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: High summer volatility continues; demand volatility increased significantly in July (P21-P23 range: 74-393).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand regime for T-shirts (late July). Historical data shows high volatility during this period: P21 demand was 393, P22 was 264, P23 was 74, and P24 was 128. While demand has slightly cooled from the 300+ peaks, July's average demand (P21-P24) is approximately 215 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With such extreme volatility (sigma) and high mean demand, the priority is to maintain high service levels during this seasonal window. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (P21-P24) and capture the high volatility using recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts. The inventory pipeline is currently heavy (1358 units in-transit), so the OR backend will moderate new orders automatically based on this coverage.

Carry-over insight: July high-volatility peak confirmed: Average demand for P21-P24 is ~215 units/week with significant variance (range 74-393).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August, following a high-volatility summer peak for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: P21 (393), P22 (264), P23 (74), P24 (128), and P25 (99). The average over this 5-period peak/post-peak window is 191.6, but the most recent 3 periods (P23-P25) average 100.3, suggesting a descent from the mid-July peak while still remaining above the pre-peak summer average (~94). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 1,346 units in transit (primarily orders from P22, P23, and P24). Given the extremely high volatility (sigma) observed in July, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture both the peak and the recent tapering, ensuring significant safety stock to handle potential secondary spikes while the system works through the large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering from July peak: 3-period average (P23-P25) is ~100 units/week, down from peak average of 215. Pipeline is heavily saturated with ~1350 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer period. While demand peaked significantly in July (P21-P22), the recent demand in P26 (227) remains well above the spring average, suggesting that the 'tapering' noted in the previous carry-over insight may have been premature or that volatility is simply very high. The in-transit pipeline is extremely saturated (955 units), with large orders from P23 (492) and P24 (463) expected to arrive in P27 and P28 respectively. The current on-hand inventory (164) plus these massive imminent arrivals (nearly 1000 units) means the risk has shifted from stockout to significant overstock/holding costs if demand continues to normalize. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (N=4 covers the high-volatility July/early Aug window: 74, 128, 99, 227) to capture this recent average of ~132 units while letting the OR engine's pipeline-capping logic prevent further ordering into an already flooded pipeline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in August; Period 26 demand (227) spiked again after three weeks of lower demand (~100), indicating a non-linear tapering from the July peak. Pipeline inventory is currently at its maximum historical level.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are in the late-summer phase for the 'Cat Tee' T-shirt. Historical data shows a massive peak in July (P21-P22) followed by a volatile tapering in August (P23-P27). Specifically, demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has been 74, 128, 99, 227, 91, averaging ~124 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high (565) and there is a massive order from Period 24 (463 units) arriving in Period 28 conclusion (visible at P29). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1028 units, which covers over 8 weeks of demand at the current average. To avoid excessive holding costs as the season likely winds down towards September, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current post-peak average demand while maintaining a cautious buffer for lingering August volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=5).

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (P23-P27) has stabilized at a lower average of ~124 units/week following the mid-July peak, though significant weekly volatility (range 74-227) persists.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand data shows that we have passed the mid-July peak for T-shirts (Period 21/22). Demand over the last two periods (Period 27-28) has settled significantly at 91 and 82 units, following a volatile July/early August. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 946 units, which was driven by large orders placed during the July peak arriving now (P23 and P24 orders). This inventory provides approximately 10-11 weeks of coverage based on the recent average demand of ~87 units/week. Since the carrying cost is $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit, and we are entering the tail end of the summer season, the priority is to avoid further accumulation of holding costs. No new orders are needed as the pipeline is clear and on-hand stock is more than sufficient for the next several lead times. I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stabilization while acknowledging the volatility seen in August.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak contraction: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~87 units/week over the last two periods (P27-P28), down from the high-volatility July average of ~215. Inventory levels are currently sufficient for ~10 weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Cat Tee' shows a significant seasonal peak in July (P21-P22) followed by a high-volatility August. The most recent demand (P29) was 193 units, a significant jump from the previous two weeks (91, 82), suggesting that while the main summer peak has passed, back-to-school or late-summer clearing demand remains volatile. However, following the massive orders placed in July (P22-P24), the on-hand inventory is currently very high at 753 units with 0 in-transit. Given the mean demand since the July peak (P23-P29) is approximately 128 units, the current stock covers nearly 6 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs as we transition out of the peak summer season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 7-period window (P23-P29) to capture the post-peak mean (~128) and volatility. This will ensure the OR backend recognizes the existing surplus and pauses ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak volatility confirmed: Demand remains high but inconsistent in late August (P29 spike to 193). Overall trend since late July (P23-P29) averages ~128 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for T-shirts has remained high and volatile in late August/early September, with Period 29 (193) and Period 30 (223) showing significantly higher volume than the previously observed post-summer contraction (~87 units). Current on-hand inventory is 530 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, this current stock must cover demand for the next 5 periods (P31-P35). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), which captures the post-peak volatility, is approximately 140 units/week. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 reflects this recent volatility more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the high variance (range 74-227) observed during this phase. With roughly 3.8 weeks of stock on hand (530/140), and a 4-period lead time, we are entering a period where we may need to place small replenishment orders if demand continues at this >200 level, but for this period, our inventory is sufficient to avoid over-ordering while monitoring if this is a secondary late-summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand surge detected: Period 29-30 demand averaged 208 units, significantly higher than the mid-August average of ~124, indicating a possible back-to-school or secondary seasonal peak for jersey basics.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which experiences significant seasonal demand. We are currently in mid-September (Period 32). Historical demand indicates a transition from the late-summer/back-to-school surge (averaging ~183 units over P29-P31) into what usually becomes an autumn cooling period. On-hand inventory is 395 and pipeline is 246 (total 641). Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods. The recent surge (P29-P31) suggests we should not drop our forecast too quickly, but the 135 unit demand in P31 indicates the peak might be passing. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (P27-P31 average is ~145) to capture the recent high-demand environment while acknowledging the expected seasonal taper. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the high volatility seen throughout August and September, ensuring the OR backend maintains sufficient safety stock against further unpredictable spikes.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge (P29-P31) averaged 183 units/week, indicating a strong back-to-school or late-summer peak, significantly higher than the mid-August level (~87).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand September phase, likely driven by back-to-school or late-summer replacement needs. Recent demand (P29-P32) has been strong, averaging 163.5 units/week (193, 223, 135, 103), which is significantly higher than the mid-August trough (~87). Although Period 31-32 show a slight week-over-week cooling, the overall regime remains elevated compared to late August. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 292 units with 449 units in-transit (ordered in P31-P32). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Using a recent sample of N=4 captures this September surge while starting to factor in the most recent stabilization. Setting L to 'calculate' to use historical consistency, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current high-but-volatile September demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge (P29-P32) confirmed with an average of ~164 units/week, significantly higher than the mid-August average (~87). Maintaining higher stock levels to avoid stockouts seen in previous peaks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sept 30, 2019), we are in a late-September demand regime for soft jersey T-shirts. The demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) has been 193, 223, 135, 103, and 172, averaging ~165 units/week. This represents a sustained secondary surge (Back-to-School/Late Summer) compared to the mid-August lows (~90 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by historical arrivals). On-hand inventory is 120 units, which is less than the current weekly demand, while the pipeline contains 628 units (ordered P31-P33). To ensure we bridge the 4-period lead time without stocking out but considering the massive 'In-transit' quantity already scheduled to arrive starting next period (P35), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current September performance. This will likely trigger a reduced order because the pipeline (628) + on-hand (120) is relatively healthy against a 5-period requirement (L+1) of roughly 825 units (165 * 5), managing the risk of overstocking as we head into October.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge (P29-P33) confirmed: average demand is ~165 units/week, significantly higher than mid-August levels (~87).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, marks the shift from the high-demand back-to-school/September period into early autumn. Recent demand in Period 34 (93) suggests a cooling off from the September surge (P29-P33 average was ~165). The last three weeks (P32-P34) average 122 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding month. However, October for 'Jersey Basics' (T-shirts) often maintains a moderate baseline. I will adjust the demand forecast to reflect this cooling trend while maintaining enough lead-time coverage (L=4). Pipeline inventory is high (795 units), which includes orders from P31-P34. On-hand at 27 units is low, but arrivals from P31 should begin this period (P35). I will use a N=6 window (P29-P34) for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring we do not under-order if October demand remains robust compared to the summer lows, but the OR backend's inventory balancing will naturally reduce orders due to the massive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected starting Period 34: Back-to-school/September surge (~165 avg) is tapering, with demand falling to 93 units. Monitoring for October baseline stability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts' is currently in a post-September/Back-to-School cooling phase. Demand in the last two periods (P34-P35) was 93 and 58, confirming the downward trend from the September average of ~165. Historically, this product saw a high of 393 in July and ~165 in September, but October demand (Period 35) has dropped to 58. On-hand inventory is 215, and the pipeline is well-saturated with 590 units (from orders in P32-P35), totaling 805 units of inventory/pipeline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent drop, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the transition toward a lower late-autumn baseline (averaging the 93 and 58 periods plus the final week of the peak). This will prevent over-ordering while the backend's base-stock logic processes the existing 590 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected at Period 34-35: Post-September peak contraction confirmed. Demand dropped from a ~165 average to 75.5 average over the last two weeks, signaling a return to a lower baseline or transition to autumn demand levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the jersey t-shirt has entered a significant downward trend following the late September/early October back-to-school peak. The last three periods (P34-P36) have shown demand values of 93, 58, and 35 units respectively, confirming a transition to autumn baseline levels. The current inventory position is high: on-hand inventory is 383 units and in-transit is 387 units (from orders in P33-P35), totaling 770 units. This is sufficient to cover approximately 12-15 weeks of demand at the current decelerating rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and falling demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (from an average of ~165 to ~62 units/week). No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend due to the inventory surplus, which is the desired outcome to minimize holding costs as we enter a slower season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand contraction confirmed: Demand has dropped for three consecutive weeks (P34-P36: 93, 58, 35) following the September surge, representing a new lower baseline regime (avg ~62).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in an autumn demand contraction phase following a significant September back-to-school surge. Observed demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 93, 58, 35, and 57 respectively, which is significantly lower than the September average of ~164. The current mean for this new lower regime is approximately 61 units/week. On-hand inventory is high at 505 units with another 208 units in transit (expected from orders in P34/P35). This current inventory level (713 total) is far above the required stock levels for the current demand regime, even with a lead time of 4. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the contraction and prevent further overstocking. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline regime confirmed: Following the September peak, demand has settled to an average of ~61 units/week (P34-P37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-407.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Cat Tee' T-shirts has transitioned into a stable autumn baseline. Since Period 34, demand has consistently stayed low, with the last four periods (P35-P38) showing values of 58, 35, 57, and 53, averaging approximately 51 units/week. This confirms the 'Autumn baseline regime' noted in the carry-over insights. Total inventory position (On-hand: 619 + In-transit: 41 = 660) is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, covering over 12 weeks of projected demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the high on-hand inventory to deplete toward the target base stock level to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this low-demand state (P34-P38 mean \u2248 59), and L to 'default' (4). Given the current excess, the OR engine's capped policy will correctly result in zero orders.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in an 'Autumn baseline regime' as of November 11th. Demand has significantly cooled following the September back-to-school/late-summer surge. Over the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 55.5 units/week (93, 58, 35, 57, 53, 37), with the most recent four periods (P36-P39) showing an even more stable average of 45.5 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 623 units, with 0 units in-transit. This stock level is sufficient to cover approximately 11-13 weeks of demand at current rates (623 / 55.5 \u2248 11.2 weeks). Given that the game ends at Period 47 (7 periods remaining), no further ordering is required. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders despite high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=6) to reflect the lower autumn baseline and ensuring the parameters reflect the stable, lower demand environment. The OR engine's base-stock logic (on-hand + pipeline - base_stock) will result in zero orders because current inventory (623) far exceeds the required base stock for the remaining periods.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18. Demand has remained in the autumn baseline regime identified in Period 37, with an average of approximately 55 units/week over the last seven periods (P34-P40: 93, 58, 35, 57, 53, 37, 57). The massive inventory buildup from the September replenishment orders has been largely realized, leaving an on-hand balance of 566 units. With zero units in transit and an average demand of ~55, the current on-hand inventory covers approximately 10 weeks of demand, which is more than double the lead-time plus review period (L+1=5). Because the on-hand inventory is significantly above any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend will correctly result in zero orders. I will set the parameters to reflect the current stable autumn regime (N=7) to ensure the backend calculations are grounded in recent data, while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 25, 2019. We are in a post-summer, mid-autumn regime for this soft jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in July followed by a secondary 'back-to-school' surge in September. Since Period 34 (late Sept), demand has significantly cooled. The most recent demand samples are: P37: 57, P38: 53, P39: 37, P40: 57, P41: 110. While Period 41 shows a surprise jump to 110 (possibly early Black Friday/pre-holiday activity), the general autumn baseline established in the carry-over insights is ~61 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 456 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 456 units covers ~4 weeks of even the high Period 41 demand, and significantly more of the autumn average. To avoid excessive holding costs as the game approaches its end (Period 47), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent baseline but with a small buffer for the late-November volatility seen in Period 41. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the trend since the start of October, which balances the cooling demand with the most recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late November volatility detected (P41 demand 110), interrupting the stable autumn baseline (~61). Monitoring for pre-holiday demand shifts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the first week of December (Period 43). Demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has risen sharply over the last two weeks (P41: 110, P42: 162), confirming a holiday-driven demand regime shift from the stable autumn baseline (~61). The current average for this new regime (P41-P42) is 136 units/week. This spike mirrors previous seasonal surges (Spring peak, Summer peak, Back-to-school peak) seen in the history of this Divided Basics item. With 294 units on hand and 0 in-transit, we have approximately two weeks of safety cover at current demand levels. Given the 4-period lead time, we must act now to replenish stock before the holiday peak exhausts the inventory. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to an explicit forecast of 680 (136 units/week * 5 periods) to account for sustained holiday demand, and sigma_hat to 120 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the high volatility typical of this SKU's peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime shift confirmed: Period 41-42 demand averaged 136 units/week, up from the autumn baseline of ~61 units (+120%). Seeking to maintain stock through the December peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9). Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' showed a clear regime shift starting Period 41, with demand spiking from ~61 to an average of 136 in P41-P42. Period 43 saw a drop to 42, which is likely a mid-season lull or a localized outlier before the final pre-Christmas surge. Given the product's character as a 'basic' staple, high volatility is expected during gift-giving periods. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture the holiday mean using a 'recent_N' of 3 (encompassing the P41 peak, P42 peak, and P43 lull) to set mu_hat, while using a wider 'recent_N' of 6 for sigma_hat to ensure we have sufficient safety stock to cover the volatility observed in both the autumn baseline and the holiday spike (range 37-162). The on-hand (252) plus in-transit (225) totals 477, which provides ~3.5 weeks of cover at the recent holiday average of 136. With 4 periods left in the game, the OR backend will calculate the final top-up needed to sustain the end-of-year demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Late Nov/early Dec (P41-P43) range 42-162. Monitoring for final pre-Christmas peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the late-stages of the holiday season. Historical pattern analysis shows demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' spiked in late November (P41-P42, avg 136) but has dropped significantly in early December (P43-P44, avg 38). However, looking at the previous 'Jersey Basic' peak (P29-P31: avg 183), we must anticipate high volatility and a potential final pre-Christmas surge. Carry-over insights confirm that holiday demand is volatile (range 42-162). With an on-hand inventory of 218 and 364 units in-transit (total pipeline 582), we are well-positioned for several weeks. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the holiday average while maintaining the calculated lead time (4 periods). The recent_N for demand is set to 4 to capture the entirety of the holiday regime (P41-P44), which averages 87 units/week. This balances the high November spike against the recent December dip.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas/Holiday season for a Jersey Basic T-shirt. Historical demand shows a holiday regime shift started around Period 41, with demand averaging approximately 80 units/week over the last 5 periods (P41-P45: 110, 162, 42, 34, 51). Although the last three weeks have been lower, we must remain cautious of late-December spikes or clearance events. The 'In-transit' inventory of 364 units consists of orders from Period 43 (225 units) and Period 44 (139 units), which are expected to arrive in Period 47 and Period 48 respectively, given the confirmed 4-period lead time. With 167 units on-hand and 364 in pipeline, our total coverage is 531 units. Given the holiday season usually peaks and then drops sharply in January, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the elevated holiday mean (~80) while allowing the OR engine to maintain a safe buffer without over-ordering as we approach the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Looking back at the historical demand for this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt), we've observed several distinct regimes: a spring peak (P7-P11), a massive summer peak (P21-P25), a back-to-school surge (P29-P33), and a more recent holiday volatility (P41-P42). Demand in the last four periods (P43-P46) has cooled significantly, averaging 41.75 units (42, 34, 51, 40). This suggests the pre-Christmas holiday peak has passed, and we are entering a post-holiday trough. On-hand inventory is 127 units with 364 units in-transit (ordered in P43 and P44, expected to arrive in P47 and P48). Given the lead time of 4 periods, these incoming shipments will saturate inventory for the current low-demand period. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this post-holiday stabilization and avoid over-ordering while the heavy pipeline clears. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand contraction confirmed: Average demand for P43-P46 dropped to 41.75 units/week, down from the early Dec holiday surge.
