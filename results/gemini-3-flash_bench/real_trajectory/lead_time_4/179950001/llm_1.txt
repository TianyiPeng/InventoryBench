To ensure we don't stock out upon arrival in P5 and have stock for P6, I will place a supplemental order. I expect the P1 order to arrive in P5.

Historical demand stabilized around 45-50 units between Periods 8-11, but the last two weeks (P12: 58, P13: 77) show an upward trend, likely driven by mid-May seasonal demand for accessories. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using a weighted average favoring recent weeks, I estimate demand at ~65 units/period. Required pipeline = 5 * 65 = 325 units. Current On-hand (114) + In-transit (60 from P13) = 174 units. This leaves a gap of 151 units.

Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime of approximately 50-70 units per period (P24: 52, P25: 66, P26: 69, P27: 63). The average demand over the last four weeks is ~63 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My decision logic requires covering demand for the current period (P28) plus the lead time (4 periods), totaling 5 periods of protection. Total required stock = 5 * 63 = 315 units. Current on-hand inventory is 243 units with 0 units in-transit (pipeline is empty as no orders were placed since P21). To reach the target of 315 units and account for the fact that on-hand inventory is already high relative to the current softened demand, I will place a small order to begin rebuilding the pipeline gradually while burning off the excess holding cost risk. An order of 50 units will bring my total position (on-hand + in-transit) to 293, which is sufficient for nearly 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate.",

Given the remaining 6 weeks of the simulation and a high-end average demand estimate of 40 units/week, the total expected demand until the end of the simulation (Period 47) is approximately 240 units (6 periods * 40 units). Since current inventory (519) significantly exceeds the total projected demand for the remainder of the game, any further ordering will only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. No further orders are required for the duration of the simulation unless a massive, unforeseen demand spike occurs.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a basic leather belt. World knowledge suggests significant demand spikes during major shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25) corresponds to the week of Black Friday, explaining the spike from ~30 units to 227 units. Demand is expected to remain relatively high through the December holiday season, but not at Black Friday peak levels. Historically, early December demand (pre-Christmas) might settle into a regime of 80-120 units based on previous seasonal shifts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 317 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Periods 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47. Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods is approximately 400-500 units (allowing for a holiday surge). With 317 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I am short by about 100-200 units to comfortably finish the season without stockouts, while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.",

Period 43 (Dec 2) showed demand of 87, which is a significant drop from the Black Friday peak but significantly higher than the pre-holiday baseline (~30-40). This aligns with the expected Dec holiday regime (~80-100 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 230. In-transit inventory is 150 (all ordered in Period 43, expected arrival Period 47 resolution). Total pipeline is 380 units. The game ends at Period 47. We need to cover demand for Period 44, 45, 46, and 47. Estimating demand at 90 units per week for the final 4 periods, total expected demand is 360 units. Pipeline (380) already covers this total.

Historical data shows a massive peak in Period 42 (Black Friday, 227 units) followed by elevated holiday demand (P43: 87, P44: 108). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P45) arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's end (P47). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs without contributing to satisfied demand. Current on-hand inventory is 122 units. Expected demand for P45 (mid-December) is ~100-110 units based on P44. For P46-47 (Late Dec), demand usually tapers off or stabilizes after the pre-Christmas rush. With 150 units arriving in Period 47 (ordered P43), total available supply for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) is 122 (on-hand) + 150 (arriving P47) = 272 units. This is sufficient to cover an average demand of ~90 units/period. Ordering more would only increase holding costs for inventory that arrives after the game ends.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), with the game ending after Period 47. Period 46 demand occurs after my decision, and Period 47 demand occurs in the final cycle. Total remaining demand needs to be satisfied by current On-Hand (18) and any arrivals in Periods 46 or 47. Checking the pipeline: Order from P42 (25 units) was delivered at P42 (LT=0) or P43 (LT=1)? Looking at history: Period 42 conclude says 'arrived 25 (ordered on Period 38, lead_time was 4 periods)'. The next order was P43 for 150 units. With a stable lead time of 4 periods, the P43 order is scheduled to arrive at the start of Period 47's demand resolution (N+L = 43+4=47). Thus, I have 18 units on hand for Period 46 demand and 150 units arriving for Period 47 demand. History shows Dec demand (post-Black Friday) is ~100-110 units/week (P44: 108, P45: 104). Period 46 (Christmas week) may see a slight surge or maintain this level. On-hand (18) is insufficient for P46 demand (~100), leading to a certain stockout this period. However, any order placed now (P46) would arrive at P50 (46+4), which is past the game end (P47). Therefore, placing an order now is useless as it would only incur holding costs if the game continued or simply waste capital. I will rely on the 150 units arriving in P47 to capture the final period's demand.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The simulation is at Period 47 (2019/12/30), which is the final period of the game. For this specific period, placing an order is irrelevant because any order placed now (with a lead time of 4 periods) would arrive in Period 51, which is beyond the scope of the simulation. Currently, 'on-hand' inventory is 0. However, the system shows 150 units 'In-transit', which originated from the order placed in Period 43. According to the execution sequence and a lead time of 4, those 150 units arrive DURING the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 47 (P43 order + 4 lead periods = P47 arrival). Therefore, these 150 units will be available to satisfy the customer demand for Period 47. Historically, demand for the late December period has dropped (P46 was 72), and as the final day of the year approaches, demand is expected to remain around or below the 100-unit mark. The 150 units arriving now are sufficient to cover this final demand period without further action.",
