Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 457892003 (Women's Everyday Basics Leggings). The provided demand history from early January to early February 2019 shows relatively stable weekly demand (66, 73, 111, 83, 85). The spike to 111 occurred around Jan 21st, which is likely a minor variation or a specific local event. The mean demand is approximately 83.6 units/week. Since on-hand and in-transit units are currently 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given this is the first decision period and we have a small but clear sample size, I will use all 5 historical samples to set the initial demand expectations. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand intensity while the backend accounts for the (L+1) factor (total protection for 5 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's clothing staple (Leggings). Historical demand (66, 73, 111, 83, 85) and the most recent Period 1 demand (61) suggest a stable demand regime despite some volatility. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order placed in Period 1 (112 units) isn't expected to arrive until Period 5 (visibility in Period 6), on-hand inventory remains 0, and we have 112 units in-transit. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including the P1 observation) to capture the current mean demand of ~83. For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=5 covers the observed volatility. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 4 until we have enough arrival data to compute actual lead times.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic jersey legging SKU. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are 66, 73, 111, 83, 85, showing a relatively stable mean around 83. Periods 1 and 2 demand were 61 and 64, which is slightly lower but consistent. Current inventory is 0 on-hand due to the 4-period lead time. Orders placed in P1 (112 units) and P2 (114 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively. Since we have no actual lead time arrivals yet, I'll stick to the promised lead time L=4. For mu_hat, the mean of all 7 samples (66, 73, 111, 83, 85, 61, 64) is approximately 77.5. (1+L)*77.5 = 387.5. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation is approximately 16.8, so sqrt(5)*16.8 = 37.6. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the most recent stability.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is standard women's jersey leggings, which usually sees steady demand but can spike with seasonal transitions. Historical demand (5 samples before P1) averaged 83.6 units/week. Since the game started (P1-P3), observed demand has been 61, 64, and 78 (avg. 67.7), trending slightly lower than the initial seed data. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (Total 333 units). The first arrival (from P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. On-hand is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead-time gap. I will use recent history (last 5 samples including the seed data leading into P1) to set demand parameters, as current training demand is slightly lower than pre-game data. L is set to default (4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's everyday jersey legging, which typically has steady demand but can be sensitive to stockouts. Historical demand provided (starting Jan 2019) was [66, 73, 111, 83, 85], averaging ~83.6. Game history demand (Periods 1-4) is [61, 64, 78, 48], averaging ~62.75. There is no clear seasonal spike yet, but demand is slightly lower in recent weeks. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 (and observed in P6 start). Since we are currently at P5 start, 'arrived=0' for P1-P4 is expected behavior for L=4. Current inventory is 0 with 412 units in transit (P1-P4 orders). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly lower recent trend (N=4) and default for lead time as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Examining the history: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 78, with 300 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Demand has slowed down recently (61, 64, 78, 48, 34). Using all available samples (including provided historical data) the mean demand is approx 73.6. Given L=4, demand over (L+1)=5 periods is expected to be ~368. Current inventory position (On-hand 78 + In-transit 300 = 378) is slightly above the expected 5-period demand. The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Leggings', which typically has stable demand, but we see a recent dip in Periods 4 and 5. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean to capture the recent normalization/cooling from the January/February peaks, while keeping lead time at the default promised value of 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history shows a recent decline: initial samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~83 units/week, while the last three periods (P4-P6) averaged 41 units/week. This suggests a transition from late winter into a shoulder season or a post-holiday drop. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower average demand (41.3) rather than the global average. On the arrivals front, both P5 and P6 saw arrivals from P1 and P2 with a lead_time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time holds. Total inventory (on-hand 150 + in-transit 186 = 336) is currently high relative to this lower demand, so the OR backend should naturally moderate ordering. I set L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 4: avg weekly demand decreased from ~83 to ~41 units (-50%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's basic legging. Analysis of the historical demand shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-3 had an average demand of 67.7, whereas Periods 4-7 dropped to an average of 39 units (specifically 48, 34, 42, 32). This drop is consistent and sustained, as noted in the carry-over insights. Recent demand matches a 'post-winter' or stable 'everyday basic' level. On-hand inventory is currently high (225 units) because orders placed during the high-demand period (Periods 1-3) successfully arrived with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. With 225 units on hand and 79 in transit (from Period 4), our total inventory of 304 units significantly exceeds the projected demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods (approx 5 * 40 = 200). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking. Lead time L is set to calculated as the observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 232 units on hand with no units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Since the demand regime shift at Period 4, demand has averaged ~41 units/week, but Period 8 saw a spike to 72. Given L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. With current demand averaging around 45-50 units (including the recent spike), 5 weeks requires approximately 225-250 units. We currently have 232 units on hand, which is near the target level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift demand average while including the recent spike (Periods 4-8: 48, 34, 42, 32, 72). L remains at default (4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in the most recent period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The carry-over insight correctly identified a downward demand shift starting in Period 4. Analyzing the recent demand (Periods 4-9): [48, 34, 42, 32, 72, 40], the mean is approximately 44.6. Note the spike in Period 8 (demand=72) likely corresponds to the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019), but demand has since returned to the lower regime (Period 9=40). All orders from Periods 1-4 arrived exactly at the promised lead time (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 192 and 56 units are in-transit (ordered Period 9), totaling 248 units of pipeline inventory. Given the mean demand of ~45 and L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 225 units). Our current pipeline of 248 is slightly above this, so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the lower demand regime and the recent seasonal fluctuation while maintaining lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). History shows a demand regime shift starting around Period 4. The initial demand (Periods 1-3) averaged ~67.7 units/week, while the recent 7 weeks (Periods 4-10) averaged ~41.7 units/week. The carry-over insight correctly identified this decrease. Looking at the lead time, orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 168 units on-hand and 85 units in-transit (orders from Period 9 and 10). Given the lead time of 4, the order placed today (P11) will arrive in P15. We need enough stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean demand of ~42/week, 5 periods require ~210 units. Our total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 168 + 85 = 253, which already exceeds this requirement. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not over-order while we burn off excess stock. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the observed 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. The product is a staple women's legging. Historical demand showed a shift around Period 4: the initial 5 weeks (including pre-game history) averaged ~83.6 units/week, while the subsequent 8 weeks (P4-P11) averaged 43.5 units/week. Recent demand (P9-P11) is 38 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 118, with 98 units in transit (expected arrivals in P13, P14, P15). Total pipeline inventory is 216 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand. With demand averaging ~44 units, base stock should be ~220. Our current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 216, which is aligned. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime since the shift in Period 4, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect lower volatility in this regime. L remains at the default (promised 4).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is in a settled low-demand regime. Since Period 4 (March 4th), demand has averaged 42.4 units per week, which is significantly lower than the initial historical data (~83 units). The current period is May 6th, 2019. We have 86 units on-hand and 150 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 9-12). All observed lead times have consistently been exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The order placed in Period 9 (56 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current Period 13 and will be visible in the next 'conclude' message. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Since the demand regime has been stable for 9 periods, I will use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand environment and prevent over-ordering as the pipeline naturally refills.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Everyday Basics Leggings) has experienced a sustained demand drop since Period 4. Pre-P4 mean was ~83, while the mean from P4-P13 is approximately 40.5 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P9 order arrived in P13). There is currently a healthy inventory position (On-hand: 112, In-transit: 118, Total: 230), which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (230 / 40.5 \u2248 5.6 periods). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level against the slightly volatile demand (recent range 24-72), I will use the recent 10-period regime (P4-P13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This aligns the OR engine with the lower demand reality and prevents over-ordering during this stable low-demand phase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically shows steady year-round demand but has recently stabilized at a lower level since early March. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 9 and 10. Since Period 4, demand has transitioned to a lower regime; the latest samples (Periods 11-14) show weekly demand values of 50, 32, 30, and 24, averaging approximately 34 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the period from early March to now) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime while filtering out the volatile high-initial-demand period. This helps the OR engine set a lower base stock, effectively reducing holding costs while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (late May). Examining the historical demand since the regime shift identified in P4 (Period 4-15), the average weekly demand is 38.75 units (ranging from 17 to 72). The last 7 periods (P9-P15) show a slightly lower, more stable mean of approximately 31 units per week. Given the product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Leggings', there is no immediate seasonal spike expected in late May/June. Lead times have been consistently verified as 4 periods (as seen in P13, P14, and P15 concludes). On-hand inventory is 113 and In-transit is 116 (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), totaling 229 units. With L=4, the system covers 5 periods of demand. At the current rate (~31/week), we need roughly 155-180 units; we currently have 229. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the recent stabilized demand mean of ~31, which results in (1+4)*31 = 155. This will likely trigger a very small or zero order to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a staple (jersey leggings), and demand has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 4. The average weekly demand from Period 4 through Period 16 is approximately 38.2 units (sum of 497 units over 13 periods). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders 9, 10, 11, and 12 all having a lead_time of 4. On-hand inventory is 141 and in-transit is 64 (the orders from periods 13, 14, and 15). Total pipeline is 205 units. With L=4, the system covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 38.2 = 191 units. Since 205 > 191, and current on-hand levels are high (holding cost $1 vs profit $19), I will continue to use the recent_N method to reflect the sustained lower demand regime while allowing the OR backend to adjust for volatility. Period 4 was the changepoint, so N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the current stable state.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a staple item (Women's Jersey Leggings). Demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop since Period 4 (early March). From Period 1 to 4, mean demand was ~63. From Period 5 to 17, mean demand fell to ~31 (a ~50% decrease). Period 17 saw extremely low demand (6 units), suggesting either a temporary outlier or a further mid-summer lull. Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods for all 9 completed orders. On-hand inventory (159) plus in-transit stock (70 units from orders in P14, P15, and P17) totals 229 units. Given the recent average demand of ~31 units, we have coverage for approximately 7.4 periods, well above the L+1 (5 period) requirement. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I will use a recent_N (N=13) to capture the lower post-shift mean while smoothing out the very low P17 demand. For lead time, since it is perfectly stable, I will use the 'calculate' method.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings. We are seeing a significant decline in demand as we move into the summer months (June), with the last two periods (Period 17 and 18) seeing demand drop to single digits (6 and 5 units respectively). The average demand since the regime shift at Period 4 was approximately 32 units, but the most recent 5-period average (Periods 14-18) has dropped to 15.2 units. Given the seasonal nature of 'everyday basics' jersey leggings, which typically see lower demand in peak summer, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand environment. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory (177) plus in-transit (47) currently totals 224, which is extremely high given the trend. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (N=5) and stay with calculated lead times to ensure the OR engine recognizes the lower required base stock and avoids over-ordering while we burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 17: weekly demand dropped significantly (avg ~5.5 units) compared to the Period 4-16 average (~35 units), likely due to summer seasonality for jersey leggings.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Womens Jersey Leggings) has entered a low-demand summer phase as noted in the Carry-over Insights (starting Period 17). Historically, demand in this new regime (P17-P19) has averaged approximately 8.7 units per week (6, 5, 15). The current on-hand inventory is 179 units, which is extremely high given the low demand. Total pipeline inventory (30 units from P17) brings total coverage even higher. My priority is to prevent further ordering through the OR backend to minimize holding costs while the current excess stock is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the recent summer demand drop (avg ~8.7, std ~5.5), which will result in a low base stock and trigger zero orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In Period 19, a seasonal demand drop was identified for these jersey leggings, as demand shifted from an average of ~38 units to under 10 units (specifically 6, 5, 15, and 11 over the last four weeks). This is consistent with summer seasonality for heavier jersey basics. On-hand inventory is currently 168 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of ~9.25 per week (providing roughly 18 weeks of cover). The in-transit pipeline (30 units from Period 17) is expected to arrive in Period 21. Because on-hand + in-transit (198) vastly exceeds even a conservative estimate of demand over the lead time (L=4), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this low-demand summer period, allowing the OR backend to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs while we burn through existing stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings, which are experiencing a seasonal demand slump during the summer months. As noted in the Carry-over Insights, a regime shift occurred at Period 17 (early June), with weekly demand dropping from an average of ~35 units to ~9 units (Periods 17-21: 6, 5, 15, 11, 8). Current on-hand inventory is 190 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for over 20 weeks). To minimize holding costs while demand is low, no new orders should be triggered. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand summer regime (approx. 9 units/week) and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been stable at 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to the calculated base stock will result in no new orders from the OR engine.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) is in a low-demand summer phase. History shows a clear regime shift after Period 16 (June 3 onwards), where demand dropped from an average of ~35 units to ~8.3 units over the last 6 periods (P17-P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 185 units, which is extremely high (covering over 20 weeks of demand at current rates). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the current low demand and the large existing stock, my priority is to prevent further ordering. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-June demand drop, which ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock significantly lower than current inventory, resulting in zero new orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (sturdy jersey leggings) is currently in a lower demand regime, likely due to summer seasonality in July. We observed a significant drop around Period 17, with recent demand averaging approximately 12.6 units over the last 7 periods (P17: 6, P18: 5, P19: 15, P20: 11, P21: 8, P22: 5, P23: 29). The Period 23 spike to 29 units might be a temporary fluctuation or a very early signal of recovery, but demand remains far below spring levels. Currently, on-hand inventory is 156 units with 0 in-transit. With an average weekly demand of ~13 units, we have over 10 weeks of stock on hand, while the lead time is 4 weeks. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining a safe service level for the summer low period, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this lower seasonal average. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 7 periods to reflect the current volatility (which includes the P23 spike). Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, currently in Period 25 (late July). Historical data shows a clear shift: demand was high in Feb/March (70-80 units), dropped during Spring (30-40 units), and was very low (avg ~5-15 units) during June and early July. However, in the last two periods (Period 23 and 24), demand has spiked back to 29 and 30 units, suggesting the start of the 'Back to School' or late-summer transition as customers prepare for early Autumn. On-hand inventory is currently 126 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering for arrivals in early September. The recent N=2 demand average is ~30, while the Summer average was ~10. To avoid over-ordering while respecting the rising trend, I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=8 samples which captures the summer trough and the recent rebound to provide a balanced forecast of approximately (1+4) * 17 = 85 units for the risk period. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover potential volatility during this transition phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at Period 23: Weekly demand increased from ~10 units (Summer trough) to ~30 units (+200%), signaling early Autumn/Back-to-School seasonality.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) is entering the 'Back-to-School' and early Autumn peak. History shows a clear rebound in Period 23, where demand jumped from summer lows (avg ~8) to a stable new regime (P23-P25 avg: 28.7 units). This matches the carry-over insight of a rebound detected at Period 23. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. With 99 units on hand and 46 in transit (arriving soon), we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new higher rate. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-rebound performance while using the calculated lead time which has been stable at 4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (sturdy jersey leggings) has transitioned from its summer demand trough (approx. 5-15 units/week) into an Autumn/Back-to-School recovery. In the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has stabilized at a higher level: 29, 30, 27, and 37 units (average ~31 units). This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 25. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. With 62 units on-hand and 50 units in-transit (ordered P25 and P26), and a 4-period lead time, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At an estimated 31 units/period, target base stock is approximately 155 units. Currently, total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 112 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this specific post-summer recovery level and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is women's jersey leggings, which are entering a peak sales period for the 'Back-to-School' and early Autumn season. Demand has surged significantly desde Period 23, with the most recent sample (Period 27) reaching 62 units, matching our total on-hand inventory and leaving us with 0 units. We are currently in a stockout state heading into Period 28. Historically, lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 88 units (orders from P25, P26, and P27), but these will not arrive until Periods 29, 30, and 31 respectively. To capture the full potential of this upward trend and prevent further lost sales once stock arrives, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to focus on the high-demand regime (Periods 23-27), which averages ~37 units per week. Given the volatility of the recent surge (27 to 62 units), I am setting sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to ensure the OR backend increases the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Surge: Clear upward trend confirmed from Period 23 to 27, with demand increasing from 29 to 62 units per week, representing a return to Spring-level demand or higher.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn demand peak (late August), which follows a clear rebound from the Summer trough. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has averaged ~38.5 units/week, but the most recent two weeks (P27/P28) averaged 54 units/week. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline of 149 units covers approximately 3 periods of the rising demand, but we face a potential stockout if the trend continues upwards. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the rebound while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat, N=6). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $734.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 23-29) shows a recovery from the summer trough (Sept/Oct seasonality for jersey leggings). Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer period, averaging ~39 units over the last 7 weeks. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) while in-transit inventory is significant (164 units). The latest arrival confirms the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1), the system should aim for a high service level. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-summer stabilization while ignoring the extremely low summer demand and the initial high spring demand. This will help maintain a consistent stock level to meet the stabilized autumn demand while the pipeline inventory gradually replenishes the on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Post-summer recovery has stabilized at approx 39 units/week (Periods 23-29) compared to the summer trough of ~10 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) has transitioned from its summer trough (approx. 10 units/week) into a higher Autumn demand regime. Demand since Period 23 has averaged roughly 40.5 units/week. In Period 30, demand was 53 units, but sales were limited to 11 due to a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 219 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals. To capture the current stabilized Autumn demand while accounting for recent stockout-influenced volatility, I am using a recent_N of 8 periods (covering the start of the recovery in Period 23 to Period 30). This equates to a \u03bc\u0302 of (1+4) * 40.5 = 202.5. The OR backend will use these parameters to generate an order that, combined with the 219 units in-transit, aims to meet demand over the next 5 periods while considering the $19 profit and $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Autumn demand season (Womens Jersey Leggings). Recent demand (Periods 27-31) has averaged 48.8 units, significantly higher than the summer trough. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 210 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, 61 units (ordered Period 28) should arrive in Period 32, followed by 61 units in Period 33, and 59 units in Period 34. To ensure the backend OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock for the current upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher Autumn mean (~49 units/week) rather than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Surge: Mean weekly demand for Periods 27-31 is 48.8 units, confirming a 25% increase over the early Autumn recovery average of ~39 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a confirmed Autumn demand regime for leggings/tights. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 27-32) is approximately 47.5 units, which aligns with the previous carry-over insight of 48.8 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently tight; we have had stockouts (ending on-hand=0) in Periods 28, 30, and 31 due to the demand surge outstripping previous low-stock levels. Although on-hand inventory is 20 and in-transit is 213, a significant portion of that in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31) is scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks. To stabilize service levels and account for the current 47.5 unit average demand, I will set L to 'calculate' and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher Autumn demand level without overreacting to individual weekly spikes. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) is currently in its peak Autumn demand phase. Period 33 demand spiked to 87 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'Autumn Surge' average of ~49. This likely reflects late September back-to-school or weather transition peaks. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P29, P30, P31, P32, and P33). Current on-hand inventory is 0, but 189 units are in-transit (ordered P30-P33). Because demand is trending higher than previous estimates, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the upward shift from Period 28-33 (average ~55 units/week) to ensure mu_hat reflects this elevated baseline (1+L)*55. This will heighten the base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high reward-to-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies carrying extra safety stock during this volatile peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand Peak Intensification: Weekly demand reached 87 units in Period 33, increasing the P28-P33 average to ~55 units, roughly 12% higher than the previously identified surge average of 48.8.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (sturdy jersey leggings) is currently in a high-demand Autumn phase. In Period 34, demand was 63 units, following a peak of 87 in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 59 units arriving, indicating high stockout risk. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is approximately 52 units, significantly higher than the summer trough. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (P30, P31, P33, P34 all ended with 0 inventory), I need to increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture the current demand level and volatility. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the Autumn recovery period and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in the last two months (ranging from 39 to 87 units).

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Intensity: Average demand for Periods 27-34 is 52 units, confirming a sustained shift from the earlier stabilization point of 39 units. Frequent stockouts (4 of last 5 periods) indicate current pipeline is insufficient for peak volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School phase, which has intensified over the last several periods. Demand for Period 35 reached 70 units, following a trend of 87 and 63 in previous periods. The average demand for the 'Autumn Surge' (Periods 27-35) is 53.8 units, significantly higher than the earlier stabilization estimate of 39. Despite a large in-transit pipeline (264 units), on-hand inventory is zero due to persistent stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this higher mean (approx 54 units/week) and ensure the OR backend increases base stock to meet this elevated seasonal demand. L remains at the default promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistently arriving on time. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Intensity reinforced: Average demand for Periods 27-35 has risen to 53.8 units/week, with frequent stockouts (5 of last 6 weeks) confirming the current pipeline is still lagging behind peak demand requirements.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings), currently in its peak Autumn season (October). Demand has consistently shifted upward since Period 27, with the average weekly demand from P27 to P36 now at approximately 58 units (calculated from 62, 46, 39, 53, 44, 41, 87, 63, 70, 61). Frequent stockouts (5 out of 7 most recent periods) indicate the existing inventory and pipeline have been lagging behind the actual high-season demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to capture this current high-demand regime specifically. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the increased volatility seen during this peak. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to aggressively build stock to capture high-margin sales ($19 profit) and avoid further stockouts during what appears to be a sustained late-Autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Intensity Peak: Mean weekly demand for Periods 27-36 has reached 58 units, a significant increase from the early Autumn recovery average of 39 units. Frequent stockouts persist.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) is in a clear upward demand trajectory as it enters late October, likely due to cooler autumn temperatures and preparation for the winter season. Demand reached a new peak of 91 units in Period 37, causing another stockout. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 74.4 units/week, significantly higher than the earlier autumn average of ~50 units. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in 7 of the last 10 periods) indicate the OR backend's standard cap is likely too restrictive for this accelerating trend. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P33-P37) to capture this most recent intensity surge (74.4 * 5 = 372). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~13.5) seen during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent history.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn Demand Surge: Weekly demand average for Periods 33-37 has increased to 74.4 units, a 43% increase over the mid-autumn average of 52 units, driven by seasonal cooling. Stockouts remain frequent.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the winter demand cycle (November/December), as evidenced by recent demand trends. Average weekly demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 70.8 units, while the very recent peak (P37) hit 91 units. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained 'Late Autumn Demand Surge' with a 43% increase over mid-autumn levels. Stockouts have occurred in 7 of the last 10 periods, indicating that historical averages are still under-forecasting current seasonal needs. To capture this momentum and prevent further stockouts during the high-demand November window, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My forecast of 380 for (1+L=5) periods is based on an expected average weekly demand of 76 units (slightly above the recent 70.8 average to account for the upward seasonal trend and to recover from stockout scenarios). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for high volatility observed in peak weeks (e.g., 91 vs 61 vs 70).

Carry-over insight: Winter Demand Peak Emergence: Average demand for Periods 34-38 has risen to 70.8 units/week, with a peak of 91 units in P37. This confirms a transition from late autumn surge into peak winter seasonality for leggings.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter demand phase for jersey leggings (Date: 2019/11/11). The demand analysis shows a sustained upward trend: the average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 72.8 units per week, with a peak of 91 units in P37. This is a significant increase from the mid-autumn average of ~54 units. Frequent stockouts have occurred because the inventory pipeline was calibrated to lower historical averages. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current peak regime (72.8 units/period * (1 + 4 lead time) = 364 total). I am also using 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (standard deviation ~11.5) seen during this surge. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. These parameters will raise the base stock level to satisfy the high winter demand and mitigate further stockouts while accounting for seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter Peak Demand Regime: Confirmed sustained high demand (avg 72.8 units/week) for Periods 35-39, representing a further increase over the Late Autumn surge.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) is in its peak winter demand phase. The current date (2019/11/18) aligns with the start of the holiday shopping season in many regions, suggesting demand will remain high or continue to climb. For the period range 35-40, the average demand is approximately 70.4 units/week. However, recent weeks have seen peaks up to 91. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed earlier in the season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering Periods 35-40) to capture this Winter Peak Regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility of this peak season compared to the summer/early autumn periods. The combination of high mu and sigma will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to satisfy high service requirements (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, firmly in the peak winter demand season for jersey leggings. Historical demand analysis confirms a sustained high-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 70.2 units/week (91, 69, 72, 59, 70), which is consistent with the 'Winter Peak Demand Regime' identified in Carry-over Insights (72.8 units/week). Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 295. The OR backend needs to cover the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the winter peak average of 72 units/week multiplied by (1+L), and use a recent_N sigma to account for the volatility seen in this peak period (std dev of ~11.5 during the peak).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019, representing the peak winter demand period for leggings. Demand has reached a new peak with 118 units in Period 42. Analyzing the most recent regime (Periods 38-42), the average weekly demand is 77.6 units, reflecting a clear increase from the 72.8 average noted in Period 40. The pipeline is currently 276 units (on-hand + in-transit), while estimated demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods) using the recent mean is ~388 units (5 * 77.6). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand holiday/winter season, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the latest volume shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 24 over the last 5 periods) seen during the current peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Winter Peak Demand Intensity: Demand average for Periods 38-42 has increased to 77.6 units/week (up from 72.8 in P35-P39), with a single-period peak of 118 units in Period 42, confirming sustained high demand through the start of December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for jersey leggings. While Period 43 saw a temporary demand dip to 47 units, the preceding weeks (P38-P42) averaged 77.6 units with a peak of 118, suggesting the dip is likely stochastic variation rather than a regime shift. In-transit inventory is healthy at 257 units, but the winter peak often coincides with Christmas/New Year shopping where demand can spike again. To avoid stockouts while respecting the OR backend's service level logic (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat to capture the recent winter intensity. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (P38-P43) which averages 72.1 units/week, providing a buffer that accounts for both the high peak in P42 and the recent low in P43. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16), nearing the end of the year and the peak winter season for leggings. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown high volatility with a recent peak of 118, though the most recent two periods (47 and 68) suggest a potential slight cooling or stabilization after the early December surge. The period 43 insight established a regime average of 77.6 units/week. However, considering the last 4 periods (47, 68, 118, 70), the average is approx 75 units. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the peak winter levels (avg approx 73.5) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat). Pipeline inventory is high (342 units) relative to on-hand (42), ensuring replenishment is en route for the final periods of the game (45-47). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for leggings. The demand for the last five periods (P41-P45) has been 70, 118, 47, 68, and 67 units, averaging 74 units/week. While demand dropped to 47 in P43, it rebounded and stabilized near the high 60s. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 24 units on-hand and 371 in-transit, we need to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts during the remainder of the peak season. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the winter surge average (approx 78 units/week) and use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in P42 (118 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for jersey leggings. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 43-46: 47, 68, 67, 64) shows a slight cooling from the early December peak (P42: 118), but demand remains high and stable, averaging 61.5 units per week over the last 4 periods. The winter peak regime previously identified (avg ~77 units) remains the relevant anchor, though we are seeing a minor post-holiday plateau. On-hand inventory is 39, with a substantial pipeline of 337 units (orders from P43-P46). Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels while preventing overstock as we potentially move past the absolute peak of winter demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current weekly average of ~66.4 units (weighted by the P42 spike) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened but stabilizing volatility.
