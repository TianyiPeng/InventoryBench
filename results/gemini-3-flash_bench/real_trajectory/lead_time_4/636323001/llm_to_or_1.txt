Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 117, 85, 225, 235, 244. This suggests a transition from a low-demand period (early Jan) into a higher-demand regime as we approach spring. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Given the inventory starts at 0, we need to establish a base stock that covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent shift to an average of ~234 units/week. For volatility (sigma_hat), 'recent_N' with N=3 will reflect the high variance seen during this ramp-up. For lead time, since there is no performance history yet, we will use the 'default' promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny high-waist ankle jeans. Historically, demand for the last 5 samples was [117, 85, 225, 235, 244]. In Period 1, actual demand was 270, which is significantly higher than the initial samples, suggesting a positive growth trend or seasonality (likely spring fashion pickup). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 251 units in transit from the Period 1 order. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. To account for the recent demand surge (from ~100 to ~250+), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (235, 244, 270). Setting L to 'default' (4) ensures the backend calculates the base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 117 -> 85 -> 225 -> 235 -> 244 (pre-game) followed by 270 (P1) and 334 (P2). This indicates a growing appetite for this SKU, possibly related to spring apparel cycles for denim. Lead time is promised at 4 periods, meaning orders from P1 are expected in P5. Total in-transit is 531 (251 from P1 + 280 from P2). Inventory is currently zero, so stockouts occurred in P1 and P2. To address the clear demand shift, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, focusing on the last 4 samples (including P1 and P2) to capture the higher volume regime (Avg \u2248 271). L is set to default as we haven't reached the first delivery window yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', and the history shows a demand trend (270, 334, 254) consistent with the initial samples (avg ~180). Recent demand is significantly higher than the early January samples, suggesting a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. We have zero on-hand inventory and 876 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit, which is expected as P1's order (with L=4) should arrive in Period 1+4=5. Therefore, no lead time can be inferred yet. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including the 5 initial samples + 3 game periods) to capture the upward shift in demand. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility. L will remain at default (4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (L=4 means Period 1 + 4 = Period 5). Therefore, it is normal that the 'Period 4 conclude' message shows 0 arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 1,209 units in transit from orders in Periods 1-4. Historical demand samples (before P1) were [117, 85, 225, 235, 244], showing an upward trend. Actual demand in P1-P4 was [270, 334, 254, 214], which indicates a higher mean (avg ~268) compared to the initial samples (avg ~181). We are entering mid-March; there isn't a massive seasonal spike immediately, but demand has clearly shifted higher than the pre-game samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L, I will stick to the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until we have evidence of drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 1: Average demand increased from ~180 to ~268 (+48%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees consistent demand in spring. In Period 5, we observed the first arrival (251 units ordered in Period 1), confirming the lead time L=4. Demand history shows a shift: Periods 1-4 averaged ~268, but Period 5 dropped to 209 (and the pre-game samples averaged ~183). Combining the carry-over insight of an increase from early pre-game levels with the more recent fluctuation, I will use recent_N=5 (all game periods) to capture the current active regime. With L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand: 42 + In-transit: 1089 = 1131) is high relative to the average demand. The OR backend will likely order minimally due to the high pipeline, but calibrating mu_hat and sigma_hat on the observed game data ensures the base stock reflects recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demand data suggests a regime shift occurred early in the series, but more recent weekly demand (Periods 3-6) has stabilized around a mean of 227.75 units. Specifically, the last four observed demands were 254, 214, 209, and 234. I will use N=4 to capture this recent stability. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and conclude messages for Period 5 and 6 confirm that orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, L is set to default. The pipeline (In-transit: 959) is significant compared to the current weekly demand, but with a total lead time coverage required for L+1 (5 periods), the backend OR logic will correctly calculate the net order needs. I'm using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady post-shift demand levels rather than the initial high spikes or long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Demand stabilized around 228 units/period over the last 4 weeks (Periods 3-6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), we experienced a significant demand spike to 548 units, which is more than double the average of the preceding four periods (~228). This spike has depleted all on-hand inventory. Looking at the calendar, late March/early April often coincides with spring fashion refreshes and the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019), which typically drives demand for denim like 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens'. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the stockout and the sudden jump in demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility while adjusting for the likely seasonal trend. This will set a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and protect against continued high demand (L=4 implies a 5-period demand coverage requirement).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Significant demand spike observed in P7 (548 units vs ~228 preceding avg), likely due to seasonal spring/Easter trends.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is Ankle-length jeans. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (548 units), likely due to pre-Easter shopping (Easter was April 21, 2019). Period 8 demand (264) returned to a level higher than the early February mean but aligned with the post-Period 5 regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Total pipeline (On-hand 69 + In-transit 903) is 972 units. Recent demand average (P5-P8) is (209+234+548+264)/4 = 313.75. To capture the recent shift and the seasonal noise without overreacting only to the spike, I'll use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher volatility seen recently (sigma) while maintaining a mean that reflects current spring demand. The L=4 lead time is stable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15) follows a period with significantly lower demand (90 units) compared to the Period 7 spike (548 units). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically see high demand during Spring (March-May). The spike in Period 7 (March 25) likely correlated with early Spring shopping or a pre-Easter surge. The drop in Period 9 (April 8) suggests that demand is volatile post-spike but likely to remain higher than the early February baseline. Lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods (L=4). To account for the recent volatility (90 to 548) and the overall Spring demand level, I will use a recent window of 5 samples (N=5: Periods 5-9) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high spike, the subsequent stabilization, and the most recent dip, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1). L=4 is consistent with all arrivals to date.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand volatility: after the P7 spike (548), demand dropped significantly in P9 (90). Average demand for P5-P9 is 269 units, which is higher than the early Feb baseline but suggests the peak surge has passed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), we have moved past the Easter/Spring demand peak observed in late March (Period 7: 548 units). Current demand has cooled significantly, with the last two periods showing 90 and 82 units respectively. This drop likely represents a post-holiday correction. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 178, and we have a very large pipeline of 1,196 units (ordered in Periods 8 and 9 to chase the spike), some of which will start arriving in Period 12. To avoid massive overstocking given the current low demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to quickly reflect the lower post-peak demand regime (averaging 78.5 units/period adjusted for 1+L). This will lower the base stock level and help the OR engine naturally reduce ordering while we bleed off the incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand drop: Demand has significantly declined following the Period 7 spike, averaging ~86 units over the last two periods (P9-P10) compared to the previous 5-period average of ~269.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. Looking at the history, the demand for Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans peaked significantly in late March (Period 7: 548 units) and has since fallen sharply as the spring/Easter peak concluded. Demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) has averaged 78.6 units (90, 82, 64), indicating a clear post-peak cooling regime. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 206 and a massive In-Transit pipeline of 1104 units (ordered during periods 8 and 9 when the system was reacting to the big stockout in P7), we are currently oversupplied for this lower demand regime. The total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1310 units, while expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods) at the current rate of ~79 units/period is only ~395 units. To prevent significant holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the last 3 periods of demand (N=3) and keeping sigma_hat at a recent window to capture the current lower volatility. L remains calculated based on the consistent 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~228 (pre-peak) to ~79 (P9-P11) following the late March surge.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is clearly in a post-peak seasonal lull. Following the late March surge (Period 7: 548 units), demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at a much lower level. The average demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) is 78.75 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 657 units, which is enough to cover over 8 weeks of current demand. Additionally, there are 574 units in transit (ordered in P9), which will arrive in next period (P13 concl / P14 start). Given the high inventory and low demand regime, the OR backend needs to be instructed to avoid additional ordering. Setting mu_hat to the recent 4-period average (total for L+1 being ~394) will signal that the current stock (657 + 574) is more than sufficient. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the new, lower demand level while keeping L=4 as the observed lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for May: Demand has settled at a significantly lower average of ~79 units/period (P9-P12) compared to the March peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans. Observed demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has been low and stable, following the March peak: [90, 82, 64, 79, 101], averaging ~83 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. We currently have a significant excess of inventory (on-hand: 1130) due to large orders placed during the peak arrival periods (P8 and P9) arriving as the demand dropped. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR engine will target a service level of 50%. Our current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 1130 units, which covers over 13 periods of demand at the current rate of ~83 units/period. Therefore, we expect the OR engine to place zero orders. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak settled demand regime, ensuring the OR engine has a realistic view of current needs even though no new orders are necessary.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand has stabilized in a 'post-peak' regime following the late March surge. For the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 85 units (90, 82, 64, 79, 101, 93). We are currently in a heavy overstock position with 1,037 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the 117-unit average of the last 3 periods and the 5-period horizon requirement (L+1). No orders are currently in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the current inventory level, no additional orders are needed for many weeks. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand stability (using N=6 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary replenishment orders while it burns through the existing stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift after the late-March peak (P7: 548 units). Since Period 9, demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging ~86 units per period over the last seven weeks (P9-P15). The current on-hand inventory of 947 units is extremely high compared to this recent demand profile. With a base stock logic targeting L+1 periods of demand, and L=4, we need to cover roughly 5 weeks of demand (approx. 430 units). Since current on-hand inventory (947) + pipeline (0) far exceeds the required base stock, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the post-peak stability and prevent over-ordering. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stability confirmed: From P9 to P15, demand has averaged 85.5 units (min 64, max 101), establishing a clear low-volume regime for late spring/early summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable post-peak demand regime, averaging 87.25 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P9-P16). The high inventory on-hand (848 units) is a direct result of large orders placed during the March peak (P8, P9) arriving while demand was sharply declining. With current demand levels, this inventory provides approximately 9-10 weeks of coverage. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory (848) already significantly exceeds the 5-period base stock target (approx 1.25 * 5 * 87.25 = 545), the OR backend should not place new orders. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) reflects the current low-demand stability (June context), ensuring the system remains responsive but doesn't over-order. I will use the default lead time (4) and recent demand statistics to calibrate the backend's internal base stock calculation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Period 17 saw a demand of 203, which is a significant jump from the previous 8-period average of ~87 units. This may indicate a mid-June seasonal uptick or a one-off fluctuation. However, on-hand inventory is very high at 645 units, and there is no in-transit inventory. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the system must be careful not to over-order while inventory is still excessive. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent demand jump using the last 3 periods (avg ~130) but will keep N low to be responsive to the shift. The high on-hand stock (645) easily covers (L+1) periods of even this higher demand (~130 * 5 = 650), so the OR backend will naturally continue to place 0 or very small orders until inventory depletes further.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in early June: Period 17 jumped to 203 units after an 8-period low-volume average of ~87 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-175.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical demand shows a significant regime shift. After a low-volume period (P9-P16, avg ~87), demand has spiked in P17 (203) and P18 (235). This suggests a summer seasonal trend for 'Ankle-length jeans'. The current on-hand inventory is 410 units, which is high compared to current demand, but the pipeline (in-transit) is nearly empty (9 units). With a 4-period lead time, we must ensure we don't stock out if this higher demand persists. However, given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will naturally lean towards a conservative base stock (the median of the forecasted demand). I will set mu_hat to the 'recent_N' of 3 periods (P16-P18: 99, 203, 235) to capture the upward trend (avg ~179/week), while using standard lead time calculations. This will allow the OR engine to determine if current inventory covers the next (L+1) periods (approx 900 units needed vs 419 total available).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed for June: Average demand for P17-P18 is 219 units, significantly higher than the April/May average of 86 units (+154%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late June (2019/6/24). Historical data shows a clear regime shift beginning in Period 17 (early June), where demand rose from an April/May average of ~85 to a June average (P17-P19) of 195.3. Specifically, demand over the last three weeks was 203, 235, and 148. This uptick likely reflects summer seasonal demand for denim. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 305 units accounts for orders from P18 (9) and P19 (296). On-hand inventory is 262. To ensure we cover the next 5 periods of demand (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this new summer regime. The mean of P17-P19 is 195.3, which results in a mu_hat of 976.5 (5 * 195.3). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=3 to capture the recent volatility correctly.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are observing the aftermath of a short-lived mid-June demand spike. Demand for Period 20 fell back to 88 units, contrasting with the P17-P18 average of 219. This confirms that the June surge was likely a temporary event (perhaps a mid-season sale or specific holiday) rather than a sustained regime change. Over the last 12 periods (P9-P20), the average demand is approximately 110 units, while the very recent 4-week average (P17-P20) is 168.5. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1/$1), the system targets a 50% service level (the median). Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) captures the recent volatility while adjusting for the immediate drop-off, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 842.5 (5 periods * 168.5) for the lead time plus review period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand (174) and In-transit (573) items are sufficient to cover this expected demand, so the OR backend will likely moderate order volume.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. The 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim is experiencing a mid-summer demand regime. After a significant spike in early June (P17-P18 avg ~219), demand has moderated over the last three periods (P19-P21: 148, 88, 141) to an average of ~125.7 units. The carry-over insight from P19 previously flagged a higher average based on the early June jump, but the most recent 5-period behavior (P17-P21) suggests a mean of ~143 units. On-hand inventory is low (33), but 'In-transit' is very high (747), representing the orders placed from P18 onwards (ordered 9, 296, 268, 174). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (last observed arrival in P13). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from the early June peak to the mid-summer stability, while avoiding over-ordering due to the massive pipeline inventory already in transit which will soon begin arriving (P18 order should arrive in P22 resolution).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) stabilized after early June peak: P17-P21 average is 143 units/period, down from the 219 average noted in the June spike.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 is currently in a mid-summer demand regime (July). Recent demand history shows a stabilization after a June spike: Period 17 (203), P18 (235), P19 (148), P20 (88), P21 (141), and P22 (147). The average demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) is approximately 131 units, while the 6-period average (P17-P22) is 160. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand 0) due to high demand in P21-P22. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (confirmed by P18 arrival in P22). To project demand for the review+lead time window (1 + 4 = 5 periods), I will use a conservative average of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher volume observed since early June, while acknowledging the moderation from the peak weeks. This targets a base stock that covers ~800 units (5 * 160). The OR engine's q-ratio (Profit 1 / (Profit 1 + Holding 1) = 0.5) will target the median demand, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) confirmed: Average demand for P19-P22 is 131 units, reflecting a post-June stabilization.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the product (Ladies Ankle Denim) is in a mid-summer regime. History shows a clear 4-period lead time (P18 arrived P22, P19 arrived P23). Demand has stabilized since the June spike; the average demand from Period 19 to 23 is 139.8 units. I will use a recent demand window (N=5) to capture this post-June stabilization. Inventory levels are reconciling well: On-hand is 121, and the pipeline contains orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23. The OR backend will aim for a base stock covering approximately 5 periods (L=4 + 1 review period) of demand, which at the current 139.8 avg is ~700 units. My current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 121 + 506 = 627, suggesting a small top-up reaching the cap. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level targeted is 50%, which the OR engine will determine from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) stabilized after June spike: Average demand for P19-P23 is 139.8 units/period, establishing a consistent mid-volume baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' is in a mid-summer (late July) demand regime. Recent demand from P19-P24 (73, 175, 147, 141, 88, 148) averages approximately 128.6 units per period, showing significant variance but stabilizing lower than the June spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). Consequently, the total exposure period is L+1=5. The goal is to cover these 5 periods of demand while balancing high holding costs (1.0 vs 1.0 profit/holding ratio implies a 0.5 service level in the base-stock model, though the capped policy helps protect against over-ordering). I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P20-P24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the post-June stabilization period most accurately. On-hand plus pipeline (316 + 310 = 626) is currently sufficient to cover expected demand (~643 over 5 periods), so parameters should maintain this balance.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (late July) confirmed: average demand for P20-P24 is 124.8 units/period, down slightly from the early July average of 139.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable mid-summer demand regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) is approximately 135.6 units ((141+147+175+73+142)/5), confirming the 'mid-summer' baseline identified in previous carry-over insights. Recent observations show a consistent lead time of 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 348 and in-transit at 136 (summing to 484), our current position covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the 135.6 average. Given the High-Waist Skinny Ankle Jeans category often sees a late August/September 'Back to School' or 'Fall transition' uptick, I will maintain a mu_hat based on the recent stable 5-period average (N=5) to avoid over-ordering before a confirmed seasonal shift while ensuring the OR engine maintains an appropriate base stock. The sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Mid-summer demand regime (August) remains stable at ~135 units/period (P21-P25 average: 135.6). Lead time consistently remains at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans has shown a significant uptick in the most recent period (P26: 204 units) compared to the July average of ~131 units. This aligns with the transition from August to late summer/pre-fall shopping. The current on-hand inventory is 179 units, and in-transit amount is 295 (from P23-P26 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent jump, I will use a shorter window (N=6, covering P21-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the steady July baseline and the recent August surge, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 147 units/period for the (L+1) horizon. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for potential continued demand growth into late August.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Late summer demand surge detected; Period 26 demand (204) is significantly higher than the July average (~131), suggesting a transition to a higher demand regime for the back-to-school/pre-fall season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P26: 204, P27: 191) confirms a shift to a higher demand regime, likely corresponding to late summer/back-to-school season. The average demand over the last two periods is 197.5 units, compared to the July average of ~131. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). With a profit-to-holding ratio of 1:1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level target (median demand), but due to the detected increase, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the upward trend (P25-P27: 142, 204, 191) while excluding the lower mid-summer plateau. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current higher demand level (~179 avg across these 3 periods) plus safety stock for the lead time (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late summer demand regime confirmed (P26-P27 average: 197.5), a significant increase from the July average of ~131.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has transitioned into a late-summer/back-to-school demand regime. Current demand in Period 28 was 219 units, following 191 in P27 and 204 in P26, confirming a sustained higher average of approximately 205 units/period compared to the July average of ~131. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 646 units in transit (spread across orders from P25 [0 units], P26 [194], P27 [219], and P28 [233]). Since the current period (P29) demand must also be covered before the P25 order (which was 0 units) or subsequent orders arrive, the OR backend must account for a total of L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this new higher regime (avg ~205). I will specify an explicit L of 4 to match the consistent historical observations and ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime stabilized (P26-P28) at an average of 204.7 units/period, representing a significant +50% increase over the July baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, entering the peak back-to-school and early autumn retail season. Historically, demand for denim ('Ankle-length jeans') has shown significant shifts aligned with seasonal changes. A stable late-summer demand regime has been established over the last four periods (P26-P29) with an average demand of 200.25 units/period (204, 191, 219, 187). This is a consistent 50%+ increase from the July baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant stockout in Period 29, meaning we are entirely dependent on arrivals. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the shift to a sustained higher volume regime for Sept/Oct, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately capture this new mean (approx 200/week) while providing sufficient coverage (1+L = 5 periods) for the upcoming weeks. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to N=4 to capture the current volatility of this higher regime. L is maintained at the calculated average.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Back-to-school) confirmed: Average demand for P26-P29 is 200.25 units/period, stabilizing the ~50% increase over July levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a confirmed September (Back-to-School/Early Fall) high-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 209.4 units, representing a sustained shift from the July baseline of ~131. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory is critically low: On-hand is 0, and despite 808 units in-transit, demand has exceeded available stock for the last two periods (P29-P30), leading to lost sales. I am setting mu_hat to reflect this higher volume regime using the last 5 periods (N=5) and maintaining lead time L at the promised 4 periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover (4+1)=5 weeks of demand at the current ~210 units/period rate, allowing the pipeline to replenish the depleted on-hand stock while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed at ~210 units/period (P26-P30 average: 209.4), a +60% increase over July levels.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable September/Back-to-School demand regime. Reviewing the last six periods (P26-P31), demand has been: 204, 191, 219, 187, 246, 225. This averages to 212 units/period, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~210 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Inventory levels are critical: on-hand is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in three of the last four periods (P28, P30, P31) because the 'cap' logic in the OR backend likely restricted order sizes during the transition to this higher demand regime. To ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) window (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-demand baseline (approx 212 * 5 = 1060). I am use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this peak (std dev is ~22, so sigma_hat calculation will be approx 22 * sqrt(5) \u2248 49). This should signal the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the September 'back-to-school' demand regime. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), the average demand has been 207 units (219, 187, 246, 225, 159). While Period 32 (159 units) showed a slight dip, the overall four-week average remains consistently above 200 units, significantly higher than July levels. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P28 order arrived P32). I will set L=4 and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility autumn regime. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) accounts for the current demand levels and recent variance to mitigate stockouts during this higher-volume period.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P28-P32) continues to average ~207 units/period, despite a moderate dip in P32 (159). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime following the late summer 'Back-to-School' transition. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 199.3 units per period. Specifically, from Period 29-33, demand has been 187, 246, 225, 159, and 160 (avg ~195). The slight dip in the last two periods (159, 160) suggests the peak surge has stabilized into a steady autumn baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 142 and in-transit at 734 (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current 4-period lead time. I will use a recent_N approach over the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the full scope of this higher demand regime since late August while filtering out earlier summer lows. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current seasonal level.

Carry-over insight: September/October autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand (P26-P33) is ~199 units, representing a sustained higher volume compared to the summer baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a high-volume September (averaging ~200 units), demand in the most recent period (P34) dropped to 102 units. Historically, we saw a similar stabilization or cooling after peak surges (e.g., April following March peaks). However, looking at the 2018/2019 transition data, mid-to-late October can still see moderate demand before winter shifts. I will transition to a more recent lookback (N=5) to capture this downward shift in mean demand (averaging 170 over the last 5 periods: 225, 159, 160, 102, plus the forecast for P35) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high in-transit inventory (725 units) and 168 on-hand, the pipeline is well-saturated, but we must ensure continuous coverage against the 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Post-September cooling detected; demand in P34 (102) is ~50% lower than the Sept average (~200), suggesting a transitional regime into Q4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering mid-October. Historically, we've seen a sharp seasonal drop starting in P34 (October 2019/09/30), with demand falling from ~200 units during the September back-to-school peak to 102 units (P34) and 79 units (P35). This cooling trend is consistent with historical patterns previously observed in April-May (late spring). Currently, on-hand inventory is 328 units and in-transit is 486 units, totaling 814 units. Given the new low-demand regime (averaging 90.5 units over the last two periods), the current pipeline is excessively high (covering ~9 weeks of demand). To prevent further inventory buildup and high holding costs (Holding=Profit=$1.0), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to reflect this collapse in demand, and using the calculated lead time which has been stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Mid-October demand cooling confirmed; demand dropped from ~200 (Sept avg) to 90.5 (P34-P35 avg), a -55% decrease, marking a transition to a low-volume autumn regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this product (skinny high-waist jeans) has clearly transitioned into a lower-volume autumn regime following the September 'back-to-school' peak. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is 93.3 units, compared to the ~200 units seen in September. With 461 units on hand and 254 in transit (total 715), our inventory is very high relative to current demand rates (covering ~7-8 periods). To avoid excessive holding costs in this lower-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new regime. L is kept at 4 as observed lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P34-P36 is 93.3 units/period, a significant reduction from the September average of ~200.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim has clearly transitioned into a low-volume autumn regime. Since Period 34 (late Sept/Oct), demand has significantly cooled from the September average of ~200 units to a 4-week average of 97.5 units (P34: 102, P35: 79, P36: 99, P37: 110). Current on-hand inventory is 486 units with 119 in-transit (total 605), which is sufficient to cover over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate of ~97.5/period. Given the lead time is 4 periods (L+1=5), the target inventory (base stock) should be approximately 487 units (5 * 97.5). Since total inventory already exceeds this target, no new order is necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent 4-period low-demand window (P34-P37) to prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs during this cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Low-volume autumn regime stabilized for late Oct; average demand (P34-P37) is 97.5 units, a ~50% reduction from the September peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), we are in a low-volume autumn demand regime following the September peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 102.8 units (102, 79, 99, 110, 124). Inventory levels are currently high with 481 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. Given the current lead time (L=4), the inventory needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using the recent demand average (~103 units), the target base stock is approximately 515 units. Since on-hand inventory is 481 and pipeline is 0, the engine will trigger a small order (roughly 34 units) to maintain the safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current stable low-demand window and 'default' for L since the 4-period lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Low-volume autumn regime stabilized (Nov): Average demand (P34-P38) is 103 units/period, roughly 50% of the September peak.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a low-volume autumn regime following the September peak. Over the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 102.7 units per period, with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently high (379 units), which is sufficient to cover nearly four periods of the current average demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and steady low demand, I will continue using the recent regime (last 6 samples) to forecast demand while maintaining a 'default' calculation for lead time (4 periods). This will likely result in small or zero orders to allow on-hand inventory to bleed down towards the new, lower base stock levels, minimizing holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-volume autumn/winter regime. Demand for the last seven periods (P34-P40) has been stable, averaging 101.4 units/period (values: 102, 79, 99, 110, 124, 102, 90). The previous high-volume September peak (~200 units) has fully subsided. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P34 order arriving P38). I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this stabilized low-volume regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current low volatility (std \u2248 15). The current inventory position (On-hand: 289, In-transit: 135) is 424 units, which covers approximately 4.2 periods of current demand. Given a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) should be around 507 units. The parameters will guide the OR engine to place a replenishment order that bridges this gap while accounting for the high service level required (Profit=Holding cost).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The SKU is a pair of skinny denim trousers, which typically sees consistent demand but can be influenced by seasonal shifts. I have detected a sustained low-volume demand regime starting around Period 34 (early October). Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand is approximately 103 units, showing high stability (min 79, max 124). My recent carry-over insights confirm this 'low-volume autumn regime.' With on-hand inventory at 171 and 216 units in-transit (ordered in P39, P40, P41), the total pipeline is 387 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 42 plus 4 future periods (total 5 periods). At an average of 103 units/period, the required inventory is ~515 units. Since 387 < 515, I will continue ordering to maintain the base stock. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this specific post-peak autumn stability (P34-P41), as using the full history would overestimate demand due to the September peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-volume autumn regime (P34-P41) confirmed: Average demand of 103 units/period with low volatility (std \u2248 15), representing a ~50% reduction from the September peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked to 221 units, a significant jump from the earlier low-volume autumn average of ~103 units. This likely signals the start of the holiday/Black Friday shopping season observed in early December. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there are 343 units in-transit, those ordered in Periods 39-42 will not begin arriving until Period 43 (next period). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, and we are entering a peak seasonal window, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent upward trend. I will use recent_N with N=3 to weigh the P40-P42 demand (Avg: 143) more heavily than the earlier floor, while acknowledging the P42 spike. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger window (N=10) to capture the increased volatility transitioning from a stable floor to a holiday peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected at Period 42: Demand increased to 221 units from a previous 8-week average of ~103 (+114.5%), indicating the start of the December seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Period 44, Dec 9). A significant demand surge was detected in Period 42 (221 units), but Period 43 saw a dip to 89 units. This volatility is common in early December before the final pre-Christmas peak. Looking at historical patterns (e.g., the March/Spring spike), we see sharp increases followed by cooling. However, since we are only three weeks from the end of the simulation (P47), we must ensure enough stock to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the 4-period lead time. Any order placed now (P44) will arrive in P48, which is after the simulation ends. Thus, the objective now shifting from 'replenishment' to 'inventory management' of the 522 units currently in-transit (ordered P40-P43). Current on-hand is 0, and we are waiting for the P40 order (102 units) to arrive in P44's resolution phase. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=3) to capture the recent high-volume trend (avg ~143) while maintaining a lead time of 4 to ensure the OR backend's capped policy correctly accounts for the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Early December volatility observed; P42 surged to 221 followed by P43 at 89. Overall trend is higher than Oct/Nov baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 42 spiked to 221 (start of holiday shopping), then dropped significantly in Period 43 (89) and Period 44 (79). This indicates a highly volatile December pattern where major shopping spikes are followed by rapid cooling, likely due to sell-through or timing of local holiday events. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49, which is past the peak holiday season and into late January. Historically (looking at P1-P4 statistics from February), January/February demand for this item ranged between 214 and 334. However, the immediate preceding weeks (P43-P44) show a significant slowdown. I will forecast a 'rebound' toward the winter baseline rather than the extreme holiday peak. I'm using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the volatile P42-P44 period) to balance the holiday spike with the sudden drop, resulting in an average of (221+89+79)/3 = 130 per period. For sigma_hat, I will use explicit high volatility (80) to account for the extreme fluctuations observed in December (80-220 range). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: December holiday volatility confirmed: Period 42 (221) vs Period 44 (79). Demand is expected to return to a 100-150 range post-Christmas.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Evaluating demand for Period 46 (Dec 23). Historical demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has been low (89, 79, 80), despite a single spike in P42 (221). This suggests the pre-Christmas 'last-minute' surge already happened or was mild for this specific SKU (skinny jeans). Given the date is Dec 23, we are entering the Christmas/Boxing Day week followed by the January sales period. Historically, demand in early Jan 2019 (P1-P4) was very high (~268 avg). I expect demand to rise again as post-holiday sales begin. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current slow period while allowing the OR backend to maintain a base stock that accounts for the high incoming pipeline (545 units). On-hand is low (24), but large orders from P42 (127), P43 (212), and P44 (192) are due to arrive in P46, P47, and P48 respectively. I will keep Lead Time at 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition: Demand stabilized at ~83 units/period during mid-December (P43-P45) following a late November spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), we are in the post-holiday period. Historical data shows that demand spiked significantly in late November (P42: 221) but has since dropped and stabilized at a much lower level (P43-P46 average: 81.75 units). This mirrors the 'post-peak cooling' observed after previous seasonal peaks (Spring, Autumn). Given that the current date is year-end/early January, I anticipate demand will remain in this lower, stable regime (approx. 80-100 units) rather than sustaining the volatile holiday highs. On-hand inventory is 72, and in-transit is 436 units (primarily from larger orders placed in P43-P44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline (436) plus on-hand (72) significantly exceeds the projected\u9700\u6c42 (approx. 5 periods * 85 units = 425), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent post-holiday stabilization, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect lower current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand has dropped and remained steady at an average of ~82 units/period (P43-P46) following the late November surge (221).
