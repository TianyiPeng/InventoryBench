Feb/March is late winter/early spring, still seeing cool weather where sweatshirts are popular. Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows demand between 38 and 60 units (avg ~47). (b) Demand Analysis: Historical mean is 46.8. I will forecast a baseline of 50 units per period. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since inventory and in-transit are 0, I must order immediately to cover the pipeline. (d) Inventory Assessment: Current inventory is 0. With L=4, an order placed now in P1 arrives during P1+4=P5, visible in P6. I need to cover demand for periods 1 through 5 (L+1 periods) to ensure stock-out risk is minimized once arrivals begin.

Given the lead time of 4 periods, my next order (P44) will arrive in Period 48. However, the game concludes at Period 47. Therefore, any order placed now will arrive after the game ends and only contribute to holding costs or unnecessary capital expenditure. My existing pipeline (400 units) plus current stock (25 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47) assuming an average demand of ~75-100 units/week. Ordering more would be counter-productive.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a men's sweatshirt (685813005), which is currently in its peak winter demand period. The current date is December 16 (Period 45). Historically, demand for this item peaked significantly during the 'Black Friday' window (Period 42: 299 units) and has remained steady between 75-106 units in the subsequent two weeks. As we approach Christmas and the final winter peak, I expect demand to remain in the 80-110 range before potentially softening post-holidays in January. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. In-transit inventory consists of 300 units: 100 units from P41 (expecting P45 conclude/P46 start), 100 from P42 (expecting P46/P47), and 100 from P43 (expecting P47/P48). On-hand inventory is very low (19 units). The game ends at Period 47. Any order placed now (P45) would arrive in Period 49 (after game end), making it useless for profit but incurring potential holding costs if it arrived early. However, my goal is to cover the next 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) with existing stock and in-transit units. My current pipeline (19 on hand + 300 in transit) equals 319 units to cover 3 periods. With expected demand around 100/period, this pipeline is sufficient. I will not place any new orders as they cannot arrive before the game ends.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a men's sweatshirt (685813005). We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas and winter season. Historical demand in the previous periods (P44-P45) has been strong (106 and 121 units), resulting in stockouts. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P42, P43, P44 (actually P42, P43 are 100 each, totaling 200). Expected arrivals: P42 order (100 units) arrives in P46, and P43 order (100 units) arrives in P47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and heavy seasonal demand (est. 100-130 units/week) likely to persist through late December/January, we need to restock to cover the gap between current in-transit arrivals and future sales. However, we must be mindful that lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive in Period 50 (late January), which might see a post-holiday dip. Given the current 200 units in pipeline arriving over the next two periods, I will place a moderate order to maintain stock for the post-holiday winter demand without over-leveraging into the spring softening.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a soft sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which is highly seasonal. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019), entering the heart of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Historically, demand for this item peaked significantly in late autumn and around Black Friday (P42: 299 units). Post-peak demand has stabilized at an average of ~94 units/week (P43-P46: 75, 106, 121, 74). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since it is the end of December, we should anticipate continued winter demand through January, but expect a gradual softening as spring approaches, similar to the pattern seen in the early weeks of the game (Late Jan/Feb 2019: ~40-50 units). Current inventory is 26 units with 200 units in-transit (P43: 100, P46: 100). The P43 order is expected to arrive during the next period (P47). To maintain service levels for a 5-period window (L+1), we need to cover ~400-450 units. Pipeline (On-hand 26 + In-transit 200) = 226 units. To reach the desired stock position against potential January demand, an order of 200 units is placed to replenish safety stock and ensure availability through the late winter phase.",
