There is no inventory on-hand or in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the decision made in Period N arrives during Period N+4 and becomes visible in Period N+5, my current order must cover demand for the period of decision plus the lead time (Total 5 periods of demand). The OR recommendation is 61 units, which uses a capped base-stock policy. However, given an average demand of ~47/unit and a 4-period lead time, a base stock level to cover 5 periods (L+1) would typically be significantly higher (e.g., 5 * 47 = 235 units). The OR 'cap' logic is purposefully conservative (\u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + safety) to prevent over-ordering early on, but 61 units is very low for a 4-period lead time starting from zero inventory. I will follow the OR's conservative lead for the first period to establish a baseline while I watch for actual lead time stability and demand trends, but I'll increase it slightly to 70 to better address the start-up stockout risk without exceeding reasonable bounds.",

The order of 70 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible to me in the Period 6 start.

Period 1 recorded a demand of 51, which is consistent with this historical mean. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basic item likely to have stable demand in February, though I should watch for potential spring dips as the weather warms.\n3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: Period 1 ended with 0 on-hand and 70 in-transit. Total pipeline is 70. The OR recommendation is 61 units. Using the base-stock logic: Target coverage for L+1 (5 periods) \u2248 5 * 47 = 235 units. Current pipeline is only 70 units. Stockouts are guaranteed for the next 3 periods regardless of today's action due to the 4-period lead time. \n4. **Correction of OR**: The OR algorithm suggests 61 units. Given that I have 0 on-hand and only 70 units in transit for a 5-period window (estimated demand ~235), I need to aggressively build the pipeline to reach the target base-stock level. However, the 'Cap' in the OR logic limits the order to 61 to prevent over-ordering in case of high variance.

From the game history, we see that 70 units were ordered in Period 1 and 61 units in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (70 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1 + 4), becoming visible in Period 6. Historical demand samples (avg ~47) and recent actual demand (P1: 51, P2: 97) suggest a rising demand regime, likely due to seasonal factors (late February) as sweatshirts are relevant for the transition from winter to spring. The OR recommendation is 88 units. This is based on calculations targeting a base stock that covers the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). Given the recent demand spike in P2 (97 units), the average demand is likely higher than the initial historical samples. Calculating target inventory: Avg demand ~60-70 units across 5 periods = 300-350 units. Current pipeline is 131. To bridge this gap, an order larger than the OR baseline is necessary, especially since we have already missed 148 units of demand (51+97) due to zero stock. I will increase the order to 110 to build a safety buffer for the apparent upward demand trend.",

However, observed demand in the game has been significantly higher: P1=51, P2=97, P3=58 (Average = 68.6). The product is a sweatshirt (seasonal for early spring) and demand is trending higher than the historical data provided. \n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation (86 units) uses a base-stock policy intended to cover demand over 1+L (5) periods. Base stock calculation: (5 * 68.6) + Safety Stock. If the average demand is ~69, the 5-period requirement is ~345. Current pipeline is 241, suggesting a need for 104 units. \n5. **Adjustment**: Given the recent demand spike in P2 (97) and the risk of stockouts for this high-profit sweatshirt, I will increase the OR recommendation of 86 slightly to 95 to ensure the pipeline covers more of the observed higher mean demand until first arrivals occur in P5.",

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (50, 38, 43, 60, 43) and recent actual demand (51, 97, 58, 44, 29, 37, 50, 44) show an average of approximately 50 units per period. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basic item. As of April 8th, we are moving further into spring, which may lead to a slight decrease in demand for 'soft sweatshirt fabric' with 'soft brushed inside', though a 'looser fit' often remains popular for transitional weather. 4. Strategic Alignment: The OR recommendation of 51 units targets a base-stock level for 5 periods (L+1). Total current inventory (176 OH + 82 IT = 258) already covers 5 periods of demand at the average rate (~50/period). However, the OR recommendation accounts for the standard deviation and high critical fractile (Profit 19 vs Holding 1). Given that we have no arrival scheduled for Period 9 (since P5 order was 0), on-hand will drop to approx 126 by the start of Period 10.

This averages ~37 units. The product is a 'soft sweatshirt fabric' item. As we move into late April (Period 11, Date: 2019/4/22), we are likely entering a warmer season where demand for sweatshirts/sweaters may naturally decline.

Coverage needed for L+1 (5) periods at an average demand of 37 units is ~185 units.

The arrival for P37 (the P33 order of 72 units) will occur after this decision phase. Demand has recently been 138, 102, 98, and 73; however, we have been stockout-constrained, meaning true demand is likely higher than sales. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the 472 units in the pipeline currently exceed its calculated base stock level which is based on a longer history including summer lows. However, looking ahead 5 periods (L+1), we need to cover demand for Periods 37-41. Assuming a high-end demand of 100 units/week, we need 500 units. With 472 in transit and 0 on hand, we are slightly short. Furthermore, we must ensure we don't run dry in Period 41 when the P37 order arrives.

Demand over the last five periods has been 138, 102, 98, 73, and 106 (averaging 103 units/week), while our historical average used by OR includes the very low summer trough. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) covers demand for the next 5 periods (Lead time + 1). Expected demand for 5 periods, based on the current autumn regime (~100 units/week), is roughly 500 units. Our current pipeline consists of: Period 34 (150 units), Period 35 (150 units), Period 36 (100 units), and Period 37 (50 units), totaling 450 units. While this pipeline will eventually resolve the stockout, we are currently at 0 on-hand and just lost sales on 106 units in Period 37. To provide a buffer for the sustained high demand and potential volatility seen in Period 33, I will place a small supplementary order of 50 units.

  "rationale": "The PETAR SWEATSHIRT is currently in its peak winter season, specifically the week of Christmas (2019/12/23). Recent demand has been high (P44: 106, P45: 121), though significantly lower than the extreme outlier of 299 units during the late November spike (P42). Current on-hand inventory is 173 units, with 150 units in-transit (ordered P43, expected arrival P47). Following the lead time of 4 periods, my current order in P46 will arrive in P50. Looking at the horizon (P46 to P50), I need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using a recent average of ~115 units/week, total expected demand is approx. 575 units. Total inventory position (173 on-hand + 150 in-transit) is 323 units. This leaves a gap of 252 units. The OR recommendation is 134 units, which is likely capped based on the long-term historical mean (~55 units/week) and doesn't fully account for the sustained winter regime. However, demand typically begins to soften in January. Since holding costs are relatively low ($1) compared to profit ($19), yet a massive overstock is risky given the high volume, I will increase the order to 200 units. This is higher than the OR recommendation but lower than the full 'catch-up' amount to account for an expected post-holiday cooling of demand while ensuring we don't stock out during the final weeks of December.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU '685813005' is a sweatshirt, which has just passed its peak holiday season (late December). Historical demand shows a massive spike in P42 (299 units) followed by a return to a stable autumn/winter regime (~75-120 units). Current on-hand inventory is 99 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 350 units: 150 units ordered in P43 (expected now in P47) and 200 units ordered in P46 (expected P50). The OR recommendation of 8 units is extremely low because it likely uses a base-stock calculation that sees the upcoming 350 units of inflow as more than sufficient for the coming weeks, especially as demand naturally softens after the holidays. Given that we have 99 on-hand and 150 units arriving this period (for a total of ~249 available units against an expected demand of ~100), and another 200 units arriving in three periods, additional orders are not needed. We are currently overstocked for the post-holiday period.",
