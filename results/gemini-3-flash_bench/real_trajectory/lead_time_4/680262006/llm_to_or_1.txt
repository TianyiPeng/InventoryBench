Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'SUPREME tights'. Demand data from the last 5 weeks shows a significant upward trend (52, 69, 123, 141, 125), suggesting the product is gaining popularity or entering a peak season for sports tights (post-New Year fitness season). The mean of the last 5 samples is 102. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this recent high-demand regime better than the long-term 'default' average. For L, we utilize the 'default' promised lead time as there is no historical arrival data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is SUPREME tights, which likely sees steady or increasing demand in early Spring (Feb/Mar). Historical demand samples show a distinct upward trend: 52, 69, 123, 141, 125, and P1 demand was 127. The average of the last 4 samples (including P1) is approx 129 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P1 order (167 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in P5). My objective is to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 129, target pipeline is ~645 units. With 167 units in-transit, there's a significant gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the shift from the low early Jan numbers to the higher Feb baseline, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing SUPREME tights. Historical data shows seasonal growth: Jan (avg 102/week) -> early Feb (125/week) -> Period 1 demand (127) -> Period 2 demand (165). This aligns with the 'new year, new you' fitness trend and the approach of spring. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 310 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in Period 1 (167 units) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in Period 6's conclude message). Because we have zero on-hand and high demand, we are currently losing sales. To address the upward trend in demand and the lost sales penalty, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth (incorporating P1 and P2 demand) and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility during this transition. I will keep L at default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest a lead time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 'SUPREME tights', a sports garment. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 52, 69, 123, 141 (pre-game) followed by 127, 165, 168 (in-game). The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~153.3. Promised lead time is 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 515 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as L=4 means the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) should arrive during P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at P6). Since demand is trending higher than the all-time average, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (~153/week). Since we have no actual lead time data yet, I will use the default promised lead time and default sigma calculation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is Supreme Tights (Ladies H&M Sport). Inventory is currently 0 because arrivals are pending based on the promised lead time (L=4). Orders placed in Period 1 (n=167) are expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and should be visible in the Period 6 start message. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has shown an upward trend: 52, 69, 123, 141, 125, 127, 165, 168, 146. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 151.5, showing a sustained increase compared to the early January/February samples. Given the product category (Sport/Tights) and March timeline, we are entering a spring fitness season where demand stabilizes at a higher plateau than winter. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent higher-volume regime while using the promised Lead Time of 4. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages confirming actual lead time, I will stick with the default calculation for L and sigma_hat until data confirms a deviation from the promised schedule.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are entering mid-March. The product is SUPREME tights (sports tights in fast-drying functional fabric), which typically sees steady demand as people engage in spring fitness activities. Historical demand has transitioned from an average of ~102 (Jan samples) to a sustained higher level of ~147 over the last 5 periods (Feb-Mar). The first order from Period 1 arrived exactly on time (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. With 40 units on hand and 737 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), we need to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period mean (~146.6) provides a more accurate forecast for the current regime than the long-term average. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~100 to ~147 units/week (+47%) compared to Jan 2019 samples. Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history for the last 6 periods (Feb-March) shows mean demand of 144 units (127, 165, 168, 146, 127, 131), significantly higher than the initial January samples provided in the context (which averaged ~102). This confirms a higher demand regime. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. The pipeline is currently full (623 units in transit), and on-hand is 52. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand mean is 144 and std dev is approximately 18.5. We will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher stabilized regime while the OR backend manages the pipeline and service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is SUPREME sports tights, which sees consistent demand in the 'Ladies H&M Sport' category. Historical demand analysis shows a stable regime since February (Period 1). The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 144 units (127, 165, 168, 146, 127, 131, 144). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived with L=4). mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean demand, which is 5 * 144 = 720. sigma_hat is set to capture the volatility observed in this period, where standard deviation is roughly 15-20 units. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the lower January pre-game samples and focus on the current active regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is sports tights (Ladies H&M Sport). Demand history from February to March shows a stable regime following the initial increase noted in the carry-over insight. For the last 8 periods (since Period 1), the mean demand is 148.25 units/week. Specifically looking at the most recent 4 periods (March 2019), the demand has been 131, 144, 178, and 127 units (avg ~145). There is no obvious new seasonal spike for early April yet, but the volatility (sigma) is slightly higher than the initial Jan samples (std of last 5 periods is approx 20.9). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). On-hand inventory is 157, with 449 in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full February-March demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a stable forecast of ~148/week while being responsive to the observed variance in this period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is 'SUPREME tights' (H&M Sport). Reviewing the history: The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (Orders from P1 to P5 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). Demand from Period 1 to Period 9 averages 147 units per week, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 6. The most recent demand (P8: 178, P9: 136) fluctuates but maintains the mean around 150. As we move into mid-April, there is no immediate evidence of a massive seasonal shift for sports tights, but we must protect against the observed volatility (Std Dev \u2248 18 in recent periods). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering all observed game demand) focuses on the post-January regime. Pipeline inventory (464) and on-hand (188) total 652 units, which covers roughly 4.4 weeks of demand; with a lead time of 4, the OR backend needs to maintain coverage for (L+1)=5 weeks. I will keep L at default (4) and set mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The product is sports tights. Historically, we've seen a demand regime shift around Period 6 where the mean increased to ~147. However, the most recent demand (Period 10) dropped significantly to 81, though Period 8 was high at 178. Averaging the demand from Period 1 to Period 10 gives 130.4. Using the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) gives a mean of 134, which seems more representative of the post-Jan regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P1-P6). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, using recent_N=5 captures the current regime (average 134 * (1+4) = 670). For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 will capture the increased volatility (std dev of [131, 144, 178, 136, 81] is ~34.8, resulting in a sigma_hat of ~78). This approach balances the risk of the recent drop in demand against the overall higher regime observed since February.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. The product is SUPREME sports tights. Demand analysis shows a clear shift: after a period of high demand (Periods 1-9, avg ~147), demand in the last two periods (P10-P11) has dropped significantly to 81 and 83. This aligns with late April, potentially marking the end of a spring fitness peak or a seasonal transition. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P7 arrived exactly at L=4). However, as demand is cooling off, mu_hat needs to adjust downward to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend while balancing against the end of the high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the shift in volatility. L is set to 'default' as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: weekly demand decreased from ~147 to ~82 (-44%) observed over the last 2 periods (P10-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for SUPREME tights (sports apparel) has shown a significant downward shift since mid-April (Period 10). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P10-P12) is 87 units, compared to the ~147 units seen in March/early April. This decline follows a typical post-spring fitness rush. History confirms the actual lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 209 and in-transit orders totaling 410 units, we have sufficient cover for the current demand regime (87 units/week * 5 weeks = 435 units needed vs 619 units total stock). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand level and prevent over-ordering while we work through high pipeline inventory. Lead time is kept at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 confirmed: mean decreased from ~147 to ~87 (-41%) observed over P10-P12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is sports tights. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 10 (mid-April). Demand dropped from an average of ~147 units/week to approximately 83.75 units/week over the last 4 periods (P10-P13: 81, 83, 97, 74). This seasonality suggests the post-New Year fitness peak has settled or the SKU is entering a lower-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of P1 through P9 orders). Current inventory levels are high: On-hand is 317 and In-transit is 228 (Orders from P10 and P11 are expected in the next two periods). Given the lower demand rate, the pipeline is already heavy. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime (N=4 represents the period since the shift at Period 10). This will lower the base stock level and prevent over-ordering as the OR backend accounts for the high existing stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. The product is SUPREME sports tights. Analysis of demand shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 10 (mid-April). Demand dropped from an average of ~147 units (Periods 1-9) to an average of ~83.6 units (Periods 10-14, n=5). This lower demand level occupies the most recent 5 weeks of history. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this lower stabilized demand regime. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-14), so the 'default' method is used. Current on-hand inventory is 387 with 75 units in transit (expected Period 15 arrival), totaling 462 units. With estimated lead demand (L+1=5) at roughly 5 * 84 = 420 units, the system currently has adequate stock; the backend OR logic will likely order minimally or zero to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' (sports leggings) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 10 (mid-April). While demand from Period 1 to 9 averaged approximately 147 units/week, demand from Period 10 to 15 has dropped to a mean of 82 units/week (81, 83, 97, 74, 83, 75). This likely reflects a post-spring fitness surge cooldown. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 15). At the start of Period 16, on-hand inventory is 387 units with 0 units in-transit. With an expected weekly demand of ~82 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which equals roughly 410 units. Our current inventory (387) is close to this required base stock. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (last 6 periods P10-P15) while maintaining L=4 to ensure the OR backend aims for an appropriate safety stock level without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 sustained: mean settled at ~82 units over P10-P15 (-44% from previous regime).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (Supreme tights) moved into a lower demand regime starting around Period 10 (mid-April). Demand in the last 7 periods (P10-P16) averages 76.1 units/week, significantly lower than the ~147 units/week seen in March. The most recent demand (P16) was only 40 units, indicating a possible further softening as we enter June. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 347 units on-hand and 55 in-transit (total 402), we have roughly 5.3 weeks of cover at the current average demand, which is sufficient for the L+1 window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this established lower demand regime, ensuring the OR backend stops over-ordering while we bleed off the excess inventory accumulated from previous high-demand orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 sustained: mean settled at ~76 units over P10-P16, reflecting seasonal cooling for this specific leggings SKU.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: Current date June 10, 2019. The SKU 'SUPREME tights' is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we move into summer. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~147 units/week in early spring to a recent average of ~44 units/week over the last 3 periods (P15: 75, P16: 40, P17: 29). On-hand inventory is high at 318 units, which, at current demand levels, covers over 7 weeks of sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while the current stock burns down. I will utilize 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the downward trend since Period 10, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: demand further declined from ~80 to ~48 (-40%) over the last 3 periods, reflecting late-season cooling for sports tights.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The SKU is 'SUPREME tights' (sports leggings), which are experiencing a pronounced seasonal demand decline as summer begins. Demand has plummeted from a high of ~147 units/week in March/April to an average of ~30.5 units over the last 4 periods (P16-P19: 40, 29, 29, 24). Inventory is currently very high (On-hand: 265, In-transit: 301) relative to this low demand regime. There is a concern regarding the orders from Period 12, 13, 14, and 15 (which were 0 units) followed by no arrivals in P16-P19. However, based on the lead time logic, orders placed in P16-P19 are not expected until P20-P23. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on all previous arrivals. To avoid further overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the 'new normal' of low summer demand (~30 units/week). L is set to default as the promised 4 periods is consistent with history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand stabilized at a very low level of ~30 units/week (P16-P19), confirming a seasonal trough for sports tights in summer.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a sustained seasonal trough for 'Supreme tights'. The most recent four periods (P17-P20) show demand figures of 29, 29, 24, and 10, averaging approximately 23 units/week. This represents a significant decline from the previous regime. Our current inventory position is very high: 310 units on-hand and 246 units in-transit (P17-P19 orders), totaling 556 units. With a target base stock likely around (4+1)*23 = 115 units, we are severely overstocked. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P16 order arrival in P20. To prevent further accumulation of expensive holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand is minimal, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will result in a base_stock much lower than our current pipeline, thereby suppressing any new orders and allowing the existing inventory to be worked down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: demand significantly declined to an average of ~23 units/week (P17-P20), confirming a summer seasonal trough for sports tights.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is SUPREME sports tights, which is experiencing a significant seasonal trough during the summer months. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has dropped to an average of 22.4 units per week, compared to the spring average of ~150 units. We have 334 units on-hand and 202 units in-transit (total 536 units), which covers over 20 weeks of current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low demand, we must minimize additional ordering while holding costs accumulate. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current seasonal trough accurately, which will allow the OR backend to set a low base stock and refrain from ordering more until excess inventory is depleted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a SKU of sports tights (leggings) characterized by high seasonal sensitivity. Currently, we are in mid-July (Period 23), which is a established seasonal trough for this garment category as reflected in the demand history. Demand has stabilized at a very low level: the last 4 periods (P19-P22) recorded demand values of 24, 10, 20, and 11, averaging ~16 units/week. This represents a sustained low-demand regime compared to the early summer average (~30). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 346 units on hand and 179 units in-transit (ordered in P19), the inventory position is 525 units. At the current demand rate of ~16 units/week, this inventory covers over 30 weeks, which is excessively high. To minimize further holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer in case of a late-summer/back-to-school demand recovery, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recent low-demand regime. The OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new orders are placed given the massive surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean decreased further from ~30 to ~16 units/week (-46%) during the peak summer weeks (P19-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 24 (late July). The SKU 'SUPREME tights' is in a clear seasonal trough, suitable for sports leggings during peak summer. Demand has declined steadily: Period 10 (~80 units), Period 15 (~50 units), Period 17 (~23 units), and finally Period 19 (~16 units). The most recent four periods (P20-P23) show extremely low demand: 10, 20, 11, and 9 units respectively (average 12.5). Current on-hand inventory is 516 units with 0 in-transit. Given the seasonal nature and the significant surplus of inventory relative to current demand of ~13 units/week, we do not need to place any orders. To ensure the OR backend does not place orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=4, P20-P23) to reflect the current trough. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: mean reached seasonal trough of ~13 units/week (P20-P23) for sports tights during peak summer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-396.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (sports tights) has entered a deep seasonal trough during the peak summer months (late July). Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has plummeted to a mean of approximately 11.5 units/week (20, 11, 9, 6). Current on-hand inventory is 510 units with no units in transit. Given the current low demand, 510 units covers approximately 44 weeks of supply, far exceeding the projected demand over the next lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. a profit of $19.0, the service level target is high (q=0.95), but the current massive inventory surplus makes any new orders unnecessary. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' based on the consistent 4-period historical performance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P20-P24) to capture the current low-demand regime, which will result in a low base stock and ensure the OR backend places no further orders while we bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an extreme seasonal trough for sports tights in July (P21-P24), with weekly demand dropping to ~11.5 units, down from ~13 in the previous regime (-12%).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The product (SUPREME sports tights) is at its seasonal trough, with demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) averaging approximately 9.5 units per week (values: 10, 20, 11, 9, 6, 11). On-hand inventory is currently 499 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high (covering over 50 weeks of current demand) compared to the required base stock for a 4-period lead time. No new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this seasonal low, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility at these low levels. The lead time L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed arrivals (P23) confirm this rhythm.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an extreme seasonal trough for sports tights in July/August (P20-P25), with weekly demand averaging ~9.5 units. Current on-hand inventory (499) is significantly overstocked for this demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 680262006 (sports tights) has hit a seasonal trough in August, with the most recent week showing a demand of 4 units and the previous few weeks averaging roughly 7-8 units. The current on-hand inventory of 495 units is extremely high relative to this demand level, which is likely to persist until the late summer/early autumn transition. With an estimated weekly demand of approximately 10 units (conservatively setting N=7 to capture the most recent trough) and a 4-period lead time, the total inventory required to cover the cycle is around 50 units. We are currently overstocked by nearly 450 units. To minimize further holding costs, I am setting parameters to ensure zero new orders are placed until the inventory level naturally depletes. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect this low-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The SKU (SUPREME sports tights) is in a deep seasonal trough during the late summer months. Demand remains extremely low, with the last four periods (P24-P27) showing demand of 6, 11, 4, and 13 units, averaging 8.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 482 units, which is sufficient to cover over 50 weeks of demand at current rates. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to minimize holding costs while demand is low. The goal is to reach zero additional ordering until inventory levels align with a potential autumn recovery. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current trough for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'default' for L as shipments are stable. No new orders will be generated by the OR backend due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a seasonal trough for sports tights (P24-P27), averaging ~8.5 units/week. Inventory levels are significantly surplus (482 units on hand) relative to current demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product (680262006, SUPREME sports tights) is in a deep seasonal trough typical of late summer. Actual demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has averaged approximately 8 units per week (6, 11, 4, 13, 6), which is significantly lower than the historical mean. On-hand inventory stands at 476 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 50 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect this low-demand regime, and keep L at default as the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the massive inventory surplus to bleed down without triggering any new orders from the OR backend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product (680262006, SUPREME tights) is in a deep seasonal trough, with demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) averaging only 7 units per week (4, 13, 6, 5). On-hand inventory is currently 471 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime. There are no units in transit. With a promised lead time of 4 and a review period of 1, the system aims to cover 5 periods of demand. Even at the previous regime's average of ~15 units, the target stock would be around 75-100 units. Since we are at 471 units, we are significantly overstocked. To minimize holding costs and prevent any further orders while we bleed off this surplus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current low demand of ~7 units. The OR backend will see that on-hand (471) >> base_stock (approx 5 * 7 + safety stock), and therefore order 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in an extreme seasonal trough as of September 2019, averaging ~7 units/week over P26-P29. Significant inventory surplus (471 units) persists.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product (SUPREME sports tights) is in an extreme seasonal trough that began in July. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 7.8 units/week (4, 13, 6, 5, 11). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 460 units, which is sufficient to cover over 50 weeks of demand at current rates. No new orders have been placed recently, and none are in transit. The primary goal remains to avoid any further procurement and minimize holding costs while the surplus inventory slowly depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the base-stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand level to prevent the OR backend from triggering any orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a deep seasonal trough for sports tights (Late Summer/Early Autumn 2019), averaging ~8 units/week over P25-P30. Significant overstock (460 units) persists.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (SUPREME sports tights) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during the transition from late summer to early autumn (September 2019). Analyzing the most recent demand regime (P25-P31), the mean weekly demand has stabilized at approximately 7.6 units (samples: 11, 4, 13, 6, 5, 11, 8). The current on-hand inventory of 452 units is extremely high, covering over 50 weeks of demand at the current rate. There are no orders in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further inventory accumulation and allow the surplus to deplete, which is best achieved by setting parameters that reflect the current low demand regime, ensuring the OR backend does not place new orders. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the stability of this seasonal floor.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 680262006 (SUPREME sports tights) remains in an extreme seasonal trough as it transitions from late summer into early autumn. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), demand has averaged approximately 7.6 units per week, with the most recent sample at 3 units. The inventory level is currently 449 units on-hand with zero units in-transit, which represents roughly 59 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the substantial overstock significantly exceeding any reasonable base stock level (\u03bc + z\u03c3), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7 to reflect the most stable part of the trough) to allow the OR backend to calculate a low base stock. The capped policy will correctly result in an order of 0 units, allowing the system to slowly deplete the excess inventory and minimize further holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30, 2019), the SKU '680262006' (sports tights) remains in a deep seasonal trough. Recent weekly demand from Period 26 to Period 33 has averaged approximately 6.25 units (4, 13, 6, 5, 11, 8, 3, 8). The current on-hand inventory is 441 units, which at the current burn rate covers over 70 weeks of demand\u2014far exceeding the remaining 14 periods of the game. The goal is to avoid any further ordering to minimize escalating holding costs while still maintaining a safety buffer. I will set the base stock parameters to a level significantly below current on-hand inventory to ensure zero orders are triggered. Using N=8 for Recent_N reflects the extended low-demand regime observed throughout late August and September.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in an extreme seasonal trough through late September (P26-P33), averaging ~6.3 units/week. On-hand inventory (441) is more than sufficient for the remainder of the game.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (SUPREME sports tights) remains in an extreme seasonal trough as of early October 2019. The current demand regime has been stable at approximately 7 units/week for the last 9 periods (P26-P34). With on-hand inventory at 433 units and a remaining game duration of 13 periods (47 total), the current stock covers approximately 60 weeks of demand at current rates. No further orders are required. I will maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to reflect this persistent low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the high inventory as a surplus needing no replenishment.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in an extreme seasonal trough as of mid-October 2019. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 6.5 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 430 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 60 weeks\u2014far exceeding the remaining 11 periods of the game (which ends at Period 47). No further orders are required. The strategy remains to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock through natural demand. I will maintain the most recent demand stats (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure the OR backend recognizes the low-demand environment, though the resulting base_stock will be significantly lower than the current inventory, naturally leading to zero new orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. The product (SUPREME sports tights) remains in an extended seasonal trough that began in mid-summer and has persisted through autumn. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), demand has averaged approximately 7.1 units per week, with very low volatility (sigma ~ 3.1). On-hand inventory is currently at 422 units, which is enough to cover over 50 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that there are only 11 periods remaining in the game (ending at P47), the primary objective is to avoid any further ordering and minimize holding costs while the existing surplus is slowly liquidated. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to 'recent_N' with N=10 captures this depressed demand regime and ensures the OR backend recognizes the significant overstock, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a deep seasonal trough through October 2019 (P27-P36), averaging ~7.1 units/week. Enormous inventory surplus (422 units) will persist until the end of the game.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (SUPREME sports tights) remains in a deep seasonal trough. Current demand (Period 27-37) is averaging approximately 7.2 units per week. The available on-hand inventory is 412 units, which is enough to cover approximately 57 weeks of demand at current rates, well beyond the remaining 10 periods of the game. The objective is to minimize holding costs while avoiding stockouts, which are currently not a risk. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand and the confirmed lead time of 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39). The SKU (SUPREME sports tights) is in a long-standing deep seasonal trough that began in summer and has persisted through autumn. Recent demand (P30-P38) has consistently averaged ~7-9 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 403 units and only 8 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 47), the current stock covers approximately 45-50 weeks of demand at the current rate. Therefore, no further orders are required. The strategy remains focused on minimizing holding costs by ensuring the OR backend's target base stock is well below current inventory levels. I will continue using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to reflect the stable but very low demand regime (approx. 7.8 units/week) and use default lead time settings as no shipments are pending.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40), and the game ends at Period 47. The product is sports leggings, which has entered a sustained deep seasonal trough. Since Period 35, demand has averaged approx. 6.8 units per week. With 400 units currently on-hand and only 8 periods remaining (including the current one), the total expected demand for the rest of the game is approx. 55 units (8 * ~7). Therefore, there is a massive inventory surplus of over 340 units. The focus remains on zeroing out new orders to minimize further holding costs, as the current stock will comfortably cover all possible demand until the game concludes. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains significantly below the current on-hand inventory to prevent any automated ordering.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). The SKU '680262006' (SUPREME sports tights) remains in a deep seasonal trough. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged only 6.6 units per week. With on-hand inventory currently at 396 units and only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, we have a significant surplus that will cover all possible demand until the end of the game, even if a late-season recovery occurs. No new orders are needed. I will maintain parameters at 'default' to allow the OR backend to recognize the high inventory relative to the low demand, resulting in zero orders being placed. The holding cost of $1.0/unit is substantial ($396 per period), but since the inventory is already on hand, the priority is simply to avoid adding to it.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). The product, Sports Tights, has been in a sustained seasonal trough since July, with demand averaging approximately 7 units per week over the last 15 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 390 units and there is an in-transit shipment of 110 units (totaling 500 units), while only 6 periods remain in the game. Total forecasted demand for the remainder of the game is approximately 40-50 units. My objective is to prevent any further ordering to minimize holding costs, as the current pipeline more than covers all potential demand until the end of the simulation. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low demand regime, which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than the current inventory, thereby stopping further orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02 (Period 43 out of 47). We are in the final 5 periods of the game. Historical demand for these sports tights showed a massive seasonal trough from July through October (averaging ~7 units/week). However, Period 42 showed a significant jump to 30 units, likely indicating the start of a winter/holiday demand recovery. Despite this uptick, on-hand inventory is 360 units and there are 110 units in-transit (ordered Period 41, expected arrival Period 45). Total inventory (470 units) is extremely high relative to any plausible demand for the remaining 5 periods (even if demand tripled from its recent peak of 30, we would only need ~150 units). Therefore, my objective is to prevent any further ordering to minimize holding costs while the existing surplus is sold off. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the recent volume increase (average ~13.3), but the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders because pipeline inventory (470) far exceeds the required stock level for 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand began recovering from seasonal trough in Period 42 (Nov-end), increasing from single digits to 30 units/week. Inventory remains in a massive surplus (>400 units total) for the final 5 periods of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019) with only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (44, 45, 46, 47). Current on-hand inventory is 357 units, and there are 110 units in-transit (ordered in Period 41, expected arrival in Period 45). Total inventory (467 units) is vastly in excess of any possible demand for the remaining 4 weeks, even with the recent recovery signal observed in Period 42 (30 units). Given high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) relative to demand, we must strictly avoid ordering more. The OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), so setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual low current demand ensures no new orders are placed. We'll use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the end-of-year activity while maintaining a lean base stock target.

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 of 47, specifically December 16, 2019. The SKU is 'SUPREME tights' (sports tights), which experienced a significant seasonal trough from May through October (~6-8 units/week). In Period 42 (late November), there was a one-time demand spike to 30 units, but demand has since returned to low levels (3-4 units/week in P43-P44). With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47) and an existing on-hand inventory of 353 units plus 110 units in-transit (expected in Period 45 or 46), our total stock is 463 units. This is vastly more than any possible demand for the remaining duration. Since holding costs are $1.0/unit and the game is ending, the priority is to minimize further holding costs by ensuring no additional orders are placed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and ensure the OR backend calculated base stock remains far below our current inventory level.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of a 47-period simulation. The item is a sports tight SKU which shows high seasonality. Demand has recently fluctuated between 3 and 30 units during a recovery phase from its summer trough. However, my on-hand inventory is 457 units, which is massive compared to the remaining duration of the game (just 2 periods left). There is zero chance of stockout given the current demand profile and inventory level. Therefore, the primary objective now is to minimize any further inventory accumulation to keep holding costs from rising further. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed. By using 'recent_N' with N=1 on L and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally suggest an order of 0 because (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be much lower than 0. No new insights are recorded as the game is concluding and the inventory surplus is already well-documented.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-357.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final period (Period 47) of the game. The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical data shows that demand for these sports tights underwent a major seasonal trough during the summer and autumn, and has recently remained very low (averaging ~5.5 units/week over the last 5 periods: P42-P46, excluding the outlier of 30 in P42). On-hand inventory is 452 units, which is far more than enough to cover any possible demand in this final period. Placing additional orders at this stage would only increase holding costs without any benefit to sales. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (reflecting current low demand) and use a lead time of 4. Given the huge inventory surplus (452 on-hand vs. a forecast of ~27-30 for mu_hat), the OR backend will correctly result in an order of 0.
