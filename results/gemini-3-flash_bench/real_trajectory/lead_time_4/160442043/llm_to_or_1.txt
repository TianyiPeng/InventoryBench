Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 160442043 (3p Sneaker Socks) has no on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 35.6 units/week (29, 32, 42, 38, 37). While late February doesn't have a massive seasonal spike for sneaker socks compared to spring/summer, demand is stable enough to establish a baseline. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no lead-time history yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent and relevant demand regime (avg 35.6, std ~5.1). This approach ensures we calculate base stock for L+1 periods (5 periods of demand) to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which is a stable, everyday item but often sees increased demand as spring approaches (Feb/March). In Period 1, we had a demand of 44 units but 0 sales because on-hand inventory was 0. We have 45 units in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Current demand samples (including the seed data) are: 29, 32, 42, 38, 37, and now 44. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 37. To prevent stockouts given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), we need to ensure our base stock (mu + z*sigma) covers demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since profit=holding cost, the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning z* = 0; the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use the last 5 samples to capture the recent slight upward trend (avg ~40.6) and set L to default (4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a 3p Sneaker Socks item. Historical demand from Jan to early Feb (pre-game) averaged 35 units/week. Since starting, demand has spiked significantly: 44 in Period 1 and 114 in Period 2 (average of ~79 over last 2 weeks). This suggests a strong seasonal shift or promotional impact as sneaker season approaches in late February. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 92 units in transit. Given the recent demand shift to 114 units, the previous historical mean is insufficient. I will use recent_N=2 for demand mean to capture the higher volume (approx 79/week) and use default for sigma to maintain a safety buffer during this high-growth phase. Since no orders have arrived yet (at P3), I will stick to the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~35 to ~79 (+125%) over the last two weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which shows a significant demand regime shift. Initial data (Jan) showed a mean demand of ~35. Recent demand in Feb/Mar (Periods 1-3) has been 44, 114, and 75, averaging ~78. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 220 units in transit. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we haven't seen any arrivals yet (first order from P1 is expected Arrival Resolution of P5). Given the product type and the early spring date (March 4th), demand for 'hidden' sneaker socks is likely to remain high or increase as weather warms. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=3) to focus on the new regime. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (4) as no orders have reached the promised window yet. Sigma will also be calculated from the recent volatile regime (N=3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which is likely experiencing a seasonal demand increase as spring approaches (March). Previous demand samples (Jan/Early Feb) averaged ~35, but Recent demand (Periods 1-4) has shown a significantly higher regime: 44, 114, 75, 50 (Avg: 70.75). The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts because the promised lead time L=4 means the first order placed in Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 5 (and visible in Period 6). We have 356 units in transit (45+47+128+136). Since no orders have concluded yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current active regime (avg ~71), while accounting for the high volatility seen in Period 2 (demand=114). Setting L=4, mu_hat uses the last 4 periods, and sigma_hat uses the last 4 periods to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to recover from the current stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 2 (Feb 18), with demand values: 44, 114, 75, 50, 50. The initial mean was ~34, but the recent mean (N=5) is ~66.6. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 311 in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of the current demand mean. However, we have experienced a stockout (sold 45 vs demand 50 in P5). To ensure we capture the spring demand trend and cover the (L+1)=5 period window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the shift from the baseline, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (114 peak). This maintains a base stock target that accounts for the current pipeline while protecting against the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~34 to ~67 (+97%) since Feb 11. Lead time confirmed at promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches (late March). Current demand remains high (average ~67 units/period since Feb 11), significantly higher than the initial Jan data (~35 units). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold = on-hand, ending inventory 0) because early orders (P1, P2) were insufficient for the subsequent demand spike. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). We have 286 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). For Period 7, I am using a recent_N of 6 to capture the higher demand regime that started in February. With L=4, the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) must cover 5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covering P1-P6) accurately reflects the ~66 unit weekly average, and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which usually sees increased demand as weather warms up and consumers transition to lower-profile footwear (Spring/Summer seasonality). Demand since mid-February (Period 2) has stabilized around an average of 72 units per week (min 50, max 114). Historical lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P5, P6, P7 conclusions demonstrate this). We currently have 50 units on-hand and 204 in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). The order from P4 (136 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 8 resolution, visible in P9. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With a mean of 72, the expected total demand over that window is 360 units. Pipeline inventory (50 OH + 204 IT = 254) is currently below this target. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the spring regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonality confirmed (April 1st): Sneaker socks demand sustained at higher levels (avg ~72) compared to Jan/Feb (avg ~35).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '3p Sneaker Socks' is entering the spring/summer season (April 8th context), where demand for low-cut socks typically peaks. Historical demand for the last five periods (P4-P8) shows a stable, high-level regime with an average of 64 units per week, significantly higher than the initial January/February levels. Inventory analysis: We have 109 units on-hand and 174 in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (verified by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), and accounting for the seasonal upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat based on the current mean of ~64 units/period across 5 periods and a sigma_hat that reflects the volatility of this active season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item for spring/summer. Historical demand from the last five weeks (P5 to P9) shows a stable regime: 50, 65, 78, 77, 77 (mean ~69). Carry-over insights suggest a shift occurred from ~35 to ~70 in early spring. The promised lead time is 4. Concluded arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8) confirm the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. However, in Period 9, the arrival for the order placed in Period 5 (which would have arrived if L=4) is missing because the order in P5 was 0 units. In-transit is currently 211 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory position (On-hand 32 + In-transit 211 = 243) vs. expected demand (5 * 70 = 350) indicates we are under-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture the established spring regime, and 'default' for lead time as it is stable at 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically experiences high demand during the spring and summer as the weather warms up. Historical demand from early February to mid-April shows a distinct regime shift: Jan/Early-Feb demand (approx. 35) jumped to a sustained 'Spring' level starting approximately Period 7, with the last 4 periods showing extremely stable demand at 77, 77, 77, 78. This indicates a very high level of predictability in the current seasonal peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P6 order arrived P10). However, the P5 order (0 units) means there was no arrival expected at P9, which depleted inventory. I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Pipeline inventory is 279, which includes orders from P7 (46), P8 (106), P9 (37), and P10 (90). To capture the current stable high demand and ensure we recover from the stockout, I'll use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting (covering the stable ~77 period), and maintain the lead time at 4. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, roughly 385 units. With 279 in transit, the system should order approximately 106 units to restore coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed: Periods 7-10 show highly consistent demand (mean ~77.5, std < 1). Stockout occurred in Period 10 due to zero-order placement in Period 5.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are managing '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historically, demand for this item shifted from ~35 units/week to ~75 units/week around February and has remained stable through April. The current inventory is 0 on-hand, with 318 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 7, demand has averaged 75.0 units with relatively low variance, except for Period 11 (65 units), which may be slightly constrained by stockout dynamics or slight cooling. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 7-11) to capture this stable 'spring' regime (average ~75 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to capture the modern volatility. L will remain at 'default' (4) as shipments are consistently arriving at the promised lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are managing 'Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item that saw a demand increase in early spring. Recent demand (Periods 7-12) shows a mean of approximately 72 units per period, though the most recent two periods (P11-P12) saw a slight dip to 65 and 58. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. We are currently recovering from stockouts in Periods 10 and 11 caused by a zero-order in Period 5. While on-hand inventory is 48, the pipeline is healthy (269 units). Given the high demand stability observed between Periods 7-10 (mean ~77) and the minor dip recently, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=6 for mu_hat captures the stable spring regime (avg ~72). I will set sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the recent variance (std ~8.5). Since stockout risk is high (Profit=Holding=1.0 suggests a 50% service level target), these parameters ensure we maintain enough pipeline to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, this SKU (sneaker socks) saw a demand surge in April (avg ~77). However, the last two concluded periods (12 and 13) show a significant drop in demand to 58 and 38 respectively, suggesting a shift as we move deeper into the season or a correction from the spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 47, and there is a total pipeline of 276 units (ordered in Periods 10-13). Period 10's order of 90 is expected to arrive during the current Period 14 (visible in Period 15). To account for the recent demand deceleration and prevent overstocking as the peak subsides, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (Periods 11-13, demand 65, 58, 38). This N=3 captures the most recent trend while maintaining enough coverage for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 13: Demand decreased from a spring average of ~77 to ~48 (-37%) over the last two weeks, suggesting a post-peak seasonal adjustment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20th), the demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has shown significant volatility. After a confirmed spring peak (~77 units/period), the demand dropped to 38 in Period 13, but then spiked to 82 in Period 14. This suggests inconsistent demand patterns as we move further into the warmer months, possibly caused by promotions or weather-driven shopping behavior. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making we aim to hit the mean demand. The lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. In-transit inventory is high (186 units), which includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 (85, 57, 44, and 0 units respectively). To avoid overstocking while accounting for the recent rebound to 82 units, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the average of the fluctuating post-peak period (approx 60.75 units per period). Sigma_hat will be set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility compared to the stable spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May 2019: After a drop to 38 units (Period 13), demand rebounded to 82 units (Period 14), diverging from the stable spring average of ~77.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand spiked significantly to 127 units, which is 5.5x the previous 5-period mean of 23. This spike, occurring in late May (May 20th), likely represents a seasonal surge for sneaker socks as warmer weather sets in. The previous carry-over insight noted a regime shift/volatility in May, and this latest data point confirms a major upward shift or high-variance peak. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 13), though 164 units are in transit. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am selecting a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trajectory (averaging 82.3 per period). This translates to mu_hat = (1+L)*82.3. Given the high volatility (38 to 127 within 3 periods), I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for this wide range and ensure a higher base stock to cover demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand surge confirmed: May demand has shifted from an average of ~50 to a volatile peak reaching 127 units (+150% from early May levels).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in a high-demand seasonal period for 'Sneaker Socks' as temperatures rise. In Period 16, demand was 114 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand hit 0). Over the last 4 periods (May/late May), demand has been highly volatile and elevated (38, 82, 127, 114), averaging ~90 units/week. This is a significant shift from the early May dip (Period 13). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 300 (orders from P13, P15, P16), we need to maintain a high base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~90) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). This helps the OR backend protect against stockouts during this summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Late May/Early June demand has stabilized at a higher mean (~90 units) with significantly elevated volatility (std > 30) compared to previous regimes.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are in a summer peak for sneaker socks. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime shifted significantly in mid-May (Period 15). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (Periods 15-17) is (127+114+97)/3 = 112.7 units, with high volatility (std ~15). We observed stockouts in the last two periods due to this surge exceeding previous projections and arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 0 with a pipeline of 408 units. The arrivals expected in Period 18 correspond to the Period 14 order (0 units). Therefore, we will likely remain out of stock this period. To recover and cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1=5), we set mu_hat based on the recent surge (N=3) to focus the OR backend on the elevated summer mean (~113 * 5 = 565). Sigma_hat is also updated using N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak established: June demand mean stabilized at ~113 units with high volatility, up from the spring average of ~77.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Sneaker Sock', which entered its summer peak in June. Demand in the last two periods was 97 and 108 units (avg ~102.5), following a volatile May peak of 127. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to lead-time delays and high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical records (P1-P13 orders all arrived with L=4). However, the order from Period 14 (90 units) was scheduled to arrive in Period 18 but did not show up in the Period 18 conclude message (arrived=0). This suggests a possible 1-period delay or loss for that specific batch, making it critical to maintain high pipeline stock. I will set the demand forecast based on the high summer levels (June avg ~110-115) to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient base stock to cover the 4+1 period lead-time window. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the June peak while smoothing the May volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, representing the summer peak for sneaker socks. Current demand is high and volatile: the last 5 periods (P15-P19) show a mean of 114 units (127, 114, 97, 108, 124) with significant stockouts. The carry-over insights confirm this summer regime shift starting around Period 17/18. Period 19's 'conclude' shows the arrival of 63 units from Period 15 (Lead Time = 4), but the Period 14 order (0 units) means there's no arrival in P18, causing a continued stockout. We currently have 0 on-hand and 483 in-transit (P16: 193, P17: 152, P18: 138, P19: 0). Given the high demand and stockout risk, I am selecting recent_N = 5 to capture the peak summer mean (~114) and volatility. This ensures the base stock (L+1 periods) is calculated against the approximately 570 units needed to cover the lead time + current period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period (July 1st) for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in mid-May, peaking throughout June. The last five demand observations are 114, 97, 108, 124, and 108 units (mean ~110). This confirms a sustained peak compared to the earlier spring average of ~77. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (Period 20 arrived order from Period 16; lead_time = 4). Inventory reconcile: On-hand is 85 units. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 377 units, consisting of orders from P17 (152), P18 (138), and P20 (87). Note: Period 19 had 0 ordered. The P17 order (152 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P21) and be visible in the next user message. To maintain high service level during this peak volatility (std ~10-15), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the summer peak accurately while using the confirmed 'default' lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (June/July): Demand mean stabilized at ~110 units (Periods 16-20 average: 110.2) with moderate volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Sneaker Socks) is in its summer peak regime (July). Demand has stabilized at a high level with a mean of approximately 110 units over the last 5-6 periods (Periods 16-21: 114, 97, 108, 124, 108, 91). Although there was a slight dip last period (91), the overall pattern remains robust for summer. Period 18's order from Period 14 was lost or skipped (no 'ordered on Period 14' arrival message), which is consistent with the high in-transit count of 314 (Period 18: 138, Period 20: 87, Period 21: 89). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula (targeting the mean) naturally achieves. I will use the last 6 periods to capture the summer peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-July (2019/7/15). Demand for sneaker socks remains in the summer peak regime, though it has stabilized from the highly volatile June levels. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 18-22) is approximately 103.4 units, slightly lower than the late June peak but significantly higher than the spring average. The lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. With 198 units on hand and 251 units in transit (intended to arrive over the next four periods), we are well-positioned. I am choosing recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand profile (mean ~103, std ~16) while excluding earlier lower-demand spring data. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates and protects against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization (July): Demand has stabilized at a slightly lower mean of ~103 units (Periods 18-22) compared to the June peak of ~113, but remains consistent with the summer regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Sneaker Sock', which typically experiences high demand throughout the summer months. Currently, we are in late July (Period 24). Historical data from the last 6 periods (Periods 18-23) shows a stable summer regime with demand samples: 108, 124, 108, 91, 86, 128 (Mean: 107.5, Std: 17.5). Despite the slight mid-summer dip noted in earlier insights, the most recent demand spike to 128 units confirms that demand remains robust. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (as seen in arrivals for Periods 20, 21, and 22). Current on-hand inventory is 70, with 319 units in-transit (orders from P20, P21, P22, P23). To maintain the service level across the L+1 window (5 periods) given a mean of ~107.5 and observed volatility, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific summer regime while filtering out the lower spring averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in a high-demand summer regime (late July). Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 99 units (108, 91, 86, 128, 82). While there was a slight dip last week to 82, the previous week's spike to 128 indicates that volatility remains high during this peak season. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P20 and P21 arrivals arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering, though P19 was skipped due to no order in P14). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most recent stable summer pattern) to capture the current mean of ~100 and protect against the high standard deviation observed. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand stabilized: Periods 20-24 show a mean of 99 units with consistent lead time of 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. Analyzing the recent demand history for SKU 160442043 (Sneaker Socks), demand has stabilized following the June peak (~113). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the mean demand is 93.0 units (91, 86, 128, 82, 78). The high observed in P23 (128) appears to be an outlier within this late-summer stabilization phase. Given the product type (Sneaker Socks), we expect demand to remain relatively steady or slightly taper as we approach late August, but it is prudent to maintain coverage for the current 5-period average. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P24 and P25). On-hand inventory is 86 units, with 331 units in transit. Using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility allows us to capture the current late-summer stabilization while smoothing out the minor fluctuations observed in July. This setting provides (L+1) = 5 periods of forecasted demand coverage, balancing the potential for high-volume weeks against holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. This SKU (Sneaker Socks) is highly seasonal. We have observed a significant demand drop in Period 26 (demand = 43) compared to the stable summer mean of ~99. This suggests the end of the peak summer season and a transition into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. To account for this shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent deceleration (average of Periods 23-26 is approx 82.75). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 118 with 304 in transit, ensuring we are well-covered even as demand cools. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) provides a balanced volatility estimate across the late-summer transition without over-reacting to a single week's drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 26: Demand decreased from summer mean of ~99 to 43 (-56%), indicating the conclusion of the summer peak for sneaker socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a new lower regime as the summer peak concludes. Period 26 demand was 43 and Period 27 demand was 76, averaging 59.5, significantly down from the summer average of ~99. Historical context from the start of the year (Periods 1-4) showed demand in the 30-50 range, suggesting a return to baseline levels for the autumn season. Given the product type (hidden sneaker socks), we expect demand to continue softening as weather cools in late August. Inventory is currently high (on-hand: 110, in-transit: 236) relative to this new lower demand, meaning the pipeline (346 units total) covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this immediate downward shift (P26-P27) and setting sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to include the transition volatility. The goal is to avoid over-ordering while the system burns through the excess summer stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed (mid-August): Mean demand dropped to ~60 units (P26-P27) from the summer peak of ~99 (-39%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently in a post-summer decline. Historical demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) shows a mean of 62.33 (43, 76, 68), which is significantly lower than the summer peak of approximately 100 units. As we move into late August, this downward trend is consistent with seasonal patterns for 'no-show' sneaker socks. On-hand inventory is currently high (178 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during the higher-demand summer regime (P24 arrival of 136 units). With 100 units already in-transit (P25: 52, P26: 48) and a lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory is 278 units. Based on the current demand rate of ~62 units/period, this inventory covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand, which aligns with the L+1 requirement (4+1=5). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering which would lead to high holding costs. L is maintained at the promised 4 periods as shipments have been arriving consistently.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline for sneaker socks confirmed: Mean demand from Period 26-28 dropped to ~62.3 units from the summer average of ~99 units (-37%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for sneaker socks. Historical demand for the last four weeks (P26-P29) has been 43, 76, 68, and 64, resulting in a mean of 62.75 units. This is a significant decrease from the summer peak (approx. 100-110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P25 order arrived in P29). With 166 units on-hand and 82 units in-transit (orders from P26 and P29), our pipeline inventory is 248 units. Given the new demand mean of ~63, our target inventory (base stock for L+1=5 periods) should be around 315 units plus a safety buffer. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this August/September stabilization phase, which will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the lower current demand while the high on-hand inventory naturally limits new ordering until the surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized in August/September (Periods 26-29) at a mean of 62.8 units, down from the summer peak of ~99 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU (sneaker socks) has transitioned out of its summer peak. In August and early September (Periods 26-30), demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime with a mean of 65.8 units (43, 76, 68, 64, 78). This is significantly lower than the summer average of ~99, but higher than the initial spring regime. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 136 and in-transit at 100 units (totaling 236 units), and an expected demand of ~66 per period, the current pipeline covers approximately 3.5 periods of demand. To maintain an optimal base stock for the next (L+1) = 5 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture this stabilized post-summer mean. Sigma remains moderate, so recent_N will be used for both to ensure the OR backend reacts to the current lower-volume, lower-volatility environment while avoiding overstocking as autumn approaches.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for 3p Sneaker Socks. Analysis of demand since the August slump (Period 26 to 31) shows the mean has stabilized around 66 units (43, 76, 68, 64, 78, 67). Although Period 30 saw a slight uptick to 78, the overall trend is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~100. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (Periods 29 and 30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 69 units and there are 189 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, and a missing/delayed P27 order previously assumed lost or late). To maintain service levels for this lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this post-summer stability (mean ~66, so mu_hat approx 330). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized (late Aug/Sept) at a mean of ~66 units based on Periods 26-31 data.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product (sneaker socks) has transitioned from its summer peak (~100 units/period) to a stable post-summer regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) has averaged 65.4 units, with recent demand being particularly consistent (78, 67, 62). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 29 and 30 matching their 4-period promised lead time. Although Periods 31 and 32 showed no arrivals, this is consistent with the skip in ordering during Periods 27 and 28. Inventory is currently low (On-hand: 7), but the pipeline is well-stocked (In-transit: 261). To maintain the current regime's service level while accounting for the recent stabilization, I will use a 7-period window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer average. This window covers the period since the significant drop in Period 26. I will use the default lead time of 4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 34 (Late September). Demand spiked to 101 in Period 33, which is significantly higher than the previous post-summer average of 66. This suggests either a late-seasonal peak or a new demand shift as we enter October. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0 due to the spike exceeding arrivals. Pipeline inventory (287) is robust, but arrivals must be managed to meet this higher demand. Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). Parameter Strategy: Transitioning to a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this upward shift quickly. Using N=4 (Periods 30-33) to calculate the mean (approx 77), which accounts for the recent 101 spike while still acknowledging the high 60s baseline. \u03c3\u0302 will use recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the 101 spike. L remains at the promised 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Potential demand shift detected in late September; Period 33 demand reached 101, breaking the 'post-summer' stabilization of ~66 units observed since Period 26. Monitoring for a sustained autumn increase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation (Period 34) was 64 units, which follows a significant peak of 101 units in Period 33. While Period 33 hinted at an autumn surge, Period 34 suggests that the demand might still be fluctuating around the post-summer average (approx 66-70 units) rather than hitting a new sustained high regime. However, to protect against potential stockouts observed in the previous two periods (ending on-hand near zero), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the trend since late July/August, including the recent volatility. This weights the calculation toward the most recent performance while smoothing the 101-unit spike. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand volatility increased in late Sept/Oct. Period 33 (101) and Period 34 (64) result in a 2nd-half-of-September average of 82.5, significantly higher than the Aug/early-Sept average of ~66, indicating an emerging autumn trend for sneaker socks.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has shown increased volatility and a slight upward trend since late September, moving from a late-summer average of ~66 up to an average of 70 over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), with a peak of 101. The 'autumn trend' noted in Period 35 is sustained, though recent demand was 51. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 40 and in-transit at 260 (covering P32-P35 orders), we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average ~70) and sigma_hat (std ~19) to capture the higher volatility observed since Period 31. This provides a safety cushion for the erratic autumn demand while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Oct 2019): Demand mean is approximately 70 units over Periods 31-35, characterized by higher volatility (std ~19) compared to the stable August/September mean of ~66.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for sneaker socks in October (Periods 35-36) has shown a decline to an average of 48.5 units, which is a significant drop from the September volatility where demand averaged around 82 units. This suggests the previously suspected 'autumn surge' was short-lived or high in variance, and we are now seeing a stabilization at a lower level as we move further into the colder season (late October). This makes sense for sneaker socks which are typically low-cut. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P32 order arrived in P36). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this recent downward trend while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect current volatility. On-hand + In-transit (299 units) is well-positioned to cover approximately 5-6 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in mid-October 2019: Mean demand decreased to ~48.5 units (Periods 35-36) from the late September/early October average of ~82 units (-41%), reflecting late-autumn cooling for low-cut sneaker socks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are analyzing '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item (low-cut socks) transitioning out of its peak. Demand in late October (Periods 35-37) has consistently dropped, averaging ~51.7 units (51, 46, 58), which is significantly lower than the preceding autumn volatile phase (avg ~82). This confirms the 'late-autumn cooling' insight. On-hand inventory is 68 units, and the pipeline is 173 units (from Periods 34, 35, and 36), which is quite high relative to the current lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the declining seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower regime (~52 units per period) to prevent excessive overstocking as we head further into winter, when sneaker sock demand typically remains low.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime for sneaker socks confirmed (late Oct): Mean demand stabilized at ~52 units (Periods 35-37), a ~37% decrease from the early Oct volatility (~82 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is healthy with 116 units on-hand and 93 units in-transit. Demand for sneaker socks has entered a 'late-autumn' cooling phase as of Period 37 (October 21). The demand in the last three periods (P36-P38) has been 46, 58, and 50, resulting in a mean of 51.3. This aligns with the seasonal expectation that demand for low-cut sneaker socks decreases as weather turns colder in November. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this downward stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility in this 'cooling' phase. This approach aims to reduce ending inventory and minimize holding costs as we head further into the low-demand winter season.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized (late Oct/early Nov): Periods 36-38 show a consistent mean of ~51 units, confirming the shift downward from the October volatility (~70-82 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442043 (Sneaker Socks) is currently in a late-autumn demand regime. As seen in the carry-over insights and recent history, demand has stabilized at a lower mean following the summer and early October peaks. For the most recent four periods (Periods 36-39), demand values were 46, 58, 50, and 30, averaging 46 units per week. The observation from Period 39 (30 units) suggests a potential further seasonal decline as we move into mid-November, which is expected for low-cut sneaker socks. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P38 and P39). On-hand inventory is 116 units with 111 units in-transit (orders from P36, P38, P39; P37 was a zero order). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current late-autumn mean of ~46 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the lowered volatility in this stabilized regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized further in early November (Period 39): Mean demand for Periods 36-39 is ~46 units, down from the October volatility (~70-82 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, moving deep into late autumn/early winter. The demand for 3p Sneaker Socks (short, fine-knit, low-cut) is experiencing a structural seasonal decline as colder weather reduces the utility of 'hidden' socks. Demand has dropped from an average of ~51 units in late October to ~29 units over the last two periods (Period 39: 30, Period 40: 28). This represents a significant shift from the previous 'late-autumn' stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am setting L to default (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent downward trend (mean ~28.6 units) while still covering the lead time window. Using a smaller N for mu_hat allows the system to react quickly to the clear seasonal drop, preventing excess inventory buildup during a period with high holding costs ($1.0/unit). Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 41 (mid-November): Sneaker socks demand decreased from ~48 units to ~29 units (-40%) over the last two weeks, marking a late-season transition to winter lows.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November 2019, transitioning into the winter season for low-cut sneaker socks. The carry-over insights indicate a significant downward shift in demand starting mid-November (Period 41). Specifically, demand has dropped from a stable late-autumn mean of ~48-50 units to 28 units (P39), 30 units (P40), and 22 units (P41). The current mean for the last 3 periods is ~26.7 units. This represents a winter regime where the product (sneaker socks) is less relevant. On-hand inventory is high (111 units), and in-transit inventory is 69 units (orders from P38, P39, P40). Total pipeline is 180 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Even at the previous higher mean of 48, we would need ~240 units; at the new mean of ~27, we need only ~135 units. Our current pipeline (180) already substantially exceeds the required base stock for this new winter regime. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to be explicit based on the new mean (~27 units * 5 periods = 135) to prevent redundant ordering. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the lower volatility associated with this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Winter regime for sneaker socks confirmed at Period 42: Demand mean has stabilized at ~27 units (Periods 39-41), representing a ~45% decrease from the late-autumn average of ~48 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442043' (Sneaker Socks) is now firmly in its winter low-demand regime. Analysis of the most recent periods (P39-P42) shows demand levels of 30, 28, 22, and 45. While P42 saw a slight uptick to 45, the overall average for the last four weeks is approximately 31.25 units, which is consistent with the 'Winter regime' identified in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS (avg ~27-31 units). Current on-hand inventory (84) plus in-transit (51) totals 135 units. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At a projected mean of ~32 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 160 units. Since 135 units are already accounted for, and the OR backend uses a capped policy that limits excess ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this low-demand winter state while allowing for the recent volatility seen in Period 42. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of sneaker socks, which exhibits strong seasonal behavior. Currently, we are in the winter regime (December), where demand has significantly dropped from the summer peak (~110 units) and autumn levels (~50-70 units). The carry-over insights for Period 42 confirm a winter stabilization at approximately 27 units. Recent demand (Periods 40-43) confirms this: 28, 22, 45, 29 (mean ~31). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 103, with 43 units in-transit (ordered P40 and P43). Given the low winter demand and high current inventory, we need to maintain a lower base stock to avoid excessive holding costs while covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Using recent_N=4 for mean demand calculation efficiently captures the current winter lows.

Carry-over insight: Winter regime for sneaker socks fully established in December (Periods 40-43): mean demand is ~31 units, reflecting seasonal lows for low-cut socks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (low-cut sneaker socks) is in a winter demand regime, which is its seasonal low. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approximately 28.4 units per period (28, 22, 45, 29, 18). While Period 42 showed a slight spike (45), the overall trend remains low as expected for this category in December. Inventory levels (On-hand: 88, In-transit: 49) are more than sufficient to cover the promised lead time (4) plus the current period (total 5 periods) based on the current mean. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures the current winter low regime (~142 total for 5 periods) and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 accounts for the recent volatility (std ~10.4). No aggressive ordering is needed as we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 45 of 47) and currently hold excess stock relative to the winter demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-December winter period (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand for sneaker socks in December (Periods 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45) show values of 28, 22, 45, 29, 18, and 20 respectively. This confirms a stable winter low regime with a mean demand of approximately 27 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 68 units, with 54 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P43, P44, P45 over the next few periods). Since the seasonal demand is low and inventory levels (on-hand + pipeline) are sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period, the focus is on maintaining this winter baseline while minimizing holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized winter demand regime since late November.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in a winter demand regime, which is the seasonal low for this item. Recent demand (Periods 40-46) has stabilized at a low mean of approximately 26.6 units (28, 22, 45, 29, 18, 20, 23). The period 42 spike to 45 units appears to be an outlier within this winter trend or a minor pre-holiday fluctuation. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrivals from periods 38, 39, and 40). To optimize for this regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance since mid-November. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for winter lows (~27 units/period) rather than being biased by the much higher autumn or summer demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime for sneaker socks fully established (mid-Nov through Dec): mean demand is ~27 units based on Periods 40-46, representing the seasonal baseline.
