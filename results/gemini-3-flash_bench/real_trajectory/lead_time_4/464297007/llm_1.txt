  "rationale": "I am managing SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie thongs). The current date is Period 1 (2019/02/11). Historically, the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) showed demand starting high (~300) and dropping significantly to 122 by Feb 4th. This decline likely represents the post-holiday/New Year surge fading. However, current period 2019/2/11 contains Valentine's Day, which typically boosts lingerie sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in P5 (Feb/March). By then, the Valentine's peak will have passed, and demand likely stabilizes back to baseline. Based on the 5 historical points, the average is ~237, but the recent trend is downward toward 120-150. Given I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to cover demand for Period 1 through Period 5 (L+1 coverage). Forecasting conservatively: P1=150 (Valentine's week), P2-P5=130 each. Total demand to cover before arrival = 150 + (4 * 130) = 670 units. I will order 670 to establish initial stock and pipeline.",

Period 1 (2019-02-11) actual demand was 159, which is slightly higher than the previous week's 122 but reflects a generally lower post-holiday/early-year level. I expect demand to stabilize around 150-200 units per week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order (670 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). d) Inventory Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for Period 1 was 159 but 0 were sold due to zero stock. Ending inventory is 0. In-transit is 670. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 periods). e) Order Logic: Estimated demand for 5 periods (2-6) is ~850-900 units (175 avg * 5). With 670 units already in transit, I need to order approximately 230 more to maintain a safety buffer and prevent stockouts once the pipeline begins to arrive. Although holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the immediate goal is to establish a consistent stock level to meet demand.",

With an on-hand inventory of 1257 units and 0 in-transit, I have approximately 3-4 weeks of cover if demand continues to average ~350-400 units. To reach the end of the game (Period 47) and maximize service levels while factoring in the 4-period lead time, I must evaluate the remaining pipeline. Orders placed now arrive in Period 45. Period 41-44 will consume ~1400 units (at 350/week), potentially exhausting current stock.
