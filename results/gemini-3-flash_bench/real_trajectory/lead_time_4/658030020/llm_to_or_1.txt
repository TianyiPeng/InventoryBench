Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Push Up Jegging', a fashion item. Looking at the demand history provided: 35, 42, 47, 58, 166. There is a massive spike on 2019-02-04 (166 units), which is likely related to the pre-Valentine's Day shopping period for the 'Ladies Denim' category. After Valentine's Day (Feb 14th), demand often corrects downward or remains slightly elevated compared to January, but the 166-unit peak is likely an outlier. The mean of the 5 samples is ~69.6, but the 'recent_1' is 166. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Since the current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, the OR engine will place a significant order. I will use a conservative approach since we are just after a major spike: I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent growth trend while smoothing the extreme 166 value slightly. L is set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a ladies' denim item. Historical demand shows a significant spike: from an average of ~45 units in January to 166 (Feb 4) and 187 (Period 1, Feb 11). This suggests a strong seasonal trend or a successful fashion cycle launch. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 160 units in transit (ordered P1, promised L=4). Because the demand has shifted dramatically from the initial weeks, using only the recent 2-3 data points for the forecast is necessary to capture the new regime and avoid being trapped in 'default' averages that underweight the current 150+ unit demand levels. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2-3 samples (N=3) which reflect this jump, and use explicit lead time of 4 as promised.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Feb 4: weekly demand jumped from ~45 to ~175 (+290%).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030020' (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a significant demand surge that started in early February. Historical samples (Jan: 35-58) contrasted with recent performance (Feb 4: 166, Feb 11: 187, Feb 18: 138) show a distinct regime shift. The current demand mean over the last 3 periods is ~164. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a total pipeline of 411 units (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in P1 is not expected to arrive until P5 conclude. For Period 3, I will set L to the default (4) as no arrivals have confirmed a drift yet. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (~164 * 5 = 820) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this new phase.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Feb 4: Mean weekly demand increased from ~45 to ~164 (+264%) sustained over 3 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030020' (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a significant demand surge that began in early February. Since the transition to the new regime (Feb 4), weekly demand has been: 166, 187, 138, and 90. Although demand in the most recent period (Period 3 conclude) dropped to 90, the mean since Feb 4 is approximately 145 units per week, compared to the January baseline of ~45. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are currently at Period 4, the first order placed (Period 1) is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 616 units in transit (160 + 251 + 205). To capture the current demand regime while accounting for the recent deceleration, I am using recent_N=4 for demand forecasting (covering the surge period). For lead time, I will stick to the default promised L=4 as we have not yet observed any arrivals to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jeggings'. Looking at the demand history, there was a massive spike in Feb (Feb 4 reached 166), but demand in the last four concluded periods (P1-P4) has been declining: 187, 138, 90, 82. This suggests the Feb spike was a localized surge (potentially a collection launch) and we are now settling into a lower, yet still elevated, regime compared to Jan. The mean of the last 4 periods is ~124. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time (L) is 4. Our first order was placed in P1. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in P1 with L=4 should arrive during the arrival phase of P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message. Since we are at the START of the P5 decision phase, we have not seen any arrivals yet. This is consistent with the promised lead time. However, our on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost significant sales. We have 831 units in transit (P1: 160, P2: 251, P3: 205, P4: 215). To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the recent demand trend, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current downward trend from the spike, and keep L at the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following Feb spike (166-187) is trending downward: P2-P4 mean is ~103 units, significantly lower than the P1 peak but higher than Jan base.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5 with exactly the promised lead time of 4 periods (arrived P5 = P1 + 4). The inventory has finally started moving, with 75 units sold in P5 leaving 85 on-hand. Demand history shows a massive spike in early February (166, 187) followed by a steady decline (138 -> 90 -> 82 -> 75). This downward trend suggests the initial spring/new-season surge for 'Push Up Jeggings' is cooling off. However, the average demand of the last 4 weeks is roughly 96 units. With L=4, the pipeline (1+L=5 weeks) needs to cover approximately 480 units. Currently, on-hand (85) + in-transit (671) = 756 units, which is significantly above the expected demand for the lead time. No new order is likely needed, but I must set parameters to reflect the recent demand trend. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-spike cooling phase (mean ~96) while acknowledging the higher volatility compared to January.

Carry-over insight: Demand is steadily declining post-February spike: observed demand dropped from 187 to 75 over 5 weeks. L=4 lead time is confirmed by the P1 order arrival in P5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. After the initial demand spike in early February (reaching 187), demand has stabilized significantly. The last three periods (P4, P5, P6) show stable demand around 74-82 units (mean ~77). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5 and P6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 262 and in-transit is 420 (from orders in P3, P4). Since we have enough stock to cover the next 8 periods at current demand levels, I will use recent trends to calculate parameters. I'll set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization (74 to 82 units) while keeping lead time calculation on the default/calculate mode as it's performing as promised.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized between 74-82 units over the last 3 periods (P4-P6), significantly lower than the February peak but higher than January levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1513.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the demand for the Push Up Jeggings has stabilized following a significant February peak. The last four periods (P4-P7) show demand of 82, 75, 74, and 99. The most recent demand (P7: 99) shows a slight uptick, but the overall trend is a stabilized mid-range regime compared to the early-year base. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 82.5 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 368 + In-transit: 215 = 583 total), which is significantly above the expected demand for the upcoming (L+1)=5 periods (~412 units). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods of data to reflect the stabilized demand and maintain L=4. This will likely result in zero or minimal orders by the OR backend as it works through the current excess stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has exited its February peak (187) and has stabilized into a post-spike regime. Over the last five periods (P4-P8), demand has been relatively consistent: 82, 75, 74, 99, 93, with an average of 84.6 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8 (all from P1-P4 orders). Currently, on-hand inventory is 490 units. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + lead time). With an average demand of ~85, the required base stock is roughly 425 units. Since on-hand (490) already exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect this stabilized 'new normal' demand regime using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to avoid over-ordering based on the earlier February surge.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' confirmed: Average weekly demand has stabilized at ~85 units (range 74-99) over the last 5 periods (P4-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has moved past its February peak (187 units) and settled into a post-spike regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P4-P9), demand has averaged 80.3 units (82, 75, 74, 99, 93, 59). The drop to 59 in P9 might be a slight softening, but the general range is stable between 60-100 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 431 units with no units in transit, following the arrivals of orders placed in P1-P4. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (observed in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At an average of ~80 units/week, 5 periods requires ~400 units. Since we have 431 units on hand and 0 in transit, our pipeline inventory (431) already exceeds the likely base stock requirement. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the stabilized post-spike mean and signal the OR backend to stop ordering while inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (P4-P9) has averaged ~80 units per week, significantly lower than the February peak but stabilized.

The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly cooled following the February peak. Recent observed demand units are P7: 99, P8: 93, P9: 59, and P10: 37, showing a clear downward trend. The most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) average approximately 63 units, but the last two periods specifically show a sharper decline to an average of 48. Given the current high on-hand inventory (394 units) and the downward trend, the goal is to avoid overstocking and allow inventory to bleed down. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 in P6, etc.). With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (1+4)=5 periods. The current on-hand of 394 units is likely sufficient to cover at least 6-8 periods of demand at current rates. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (avg ~70.5) to reflect the recent cooling while not overreacting to the single lowest point (37), and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-February peak demand has entered a sustained decline, dropping from an average of ~85 (P4-P8) to ~48 (P9-P10), signaling a possible end to the seasonal cycle for this SKU.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has exited its February-March peak and is now in a sustained low-demand regime. Demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) has averaged 47 units (59, 37, 45), compared to the ~80-85 units seen earlier in the spring. Currently, we have 349 units on-hand and 74 units in-transit (ordered P10 and P11), totaling 423 units. With the promised lead time of 4 periods, we are protected for the next 5 periods. At the current demand rate (47 units/week), 5 weeks of demand is roughly 235 units. Our inventory position of 423 is significantly above this, meaning we have a surplus of over 180 units. The focus must be on avoiding further overstock and minimizing holding costs as the seasonal cycle winds down. I am setting L to 4 (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P8), and mu_hat will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the current lower demand level of ~47/week, translating to a target base stock of approximately 235 before factoring in safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has moved to a 'Late Spring' low: Average demand over P9-P11 is 47 units, a 45% decrease from the previous stable range of 80-85 (P4-P8). Inventory levels are currently in surplus relative to this new regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has exited its peak February/March demand season and entered a lower-demand 'late spring' regime. Demand in Period 12 (79 units) was higher than the previous few weeks (~45 units), but still aligned with the broader post-spike stabilizing trend. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 270 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current average rate (~55-60 units). Pipeline inventory includes two small orders from P10 and P11 total 74 units, expected to arrive around P14 and P15. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P8-P12) to capture the lower demand floor while acknowledging the slight uptick in P12. This will likely result in a near-zero order to allow existing stock to deplete, minimizing holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a lower-demand regime typical for late spring (May). Recent demand (P12-P13) has shown a slight uptick to 58-79 units from the late April lows, but remains significantly below the February peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 55.6 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 212 units, and pipeline inventory is 129 units (orders from P10, P11, and P13), totaling 341 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~56 units/week, required inventory is approximately 280 units plus safety stock. Since the total inventory (341) exceeds the expected demand over the lead time, the OR backend capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized, lower-demand regime while maintaining L at calculate to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Spring (P9-P13): Mean weekly demand is 55.6 units (range 37-79), down from the early Spring average of ~85.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a stable late-spring demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 55.67 units (SD \u2248 14.5), which is a significant drop from the spring peak earlier in the year. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (Period 10 order arrived in Period 14). We are currently in a surplus position with On-hand=180 and In-transit=105, totaling 285 units. At the current demand rate of ~56 units/period, this inventory covers approximately 5 periods of demand. Since the lead time is 4, we must maintain a base stock level (\u03bc\u0302) that covers L+1 = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current 55-60 unit demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility. This will likely result in a small or zero order this period as we draw down the existing surplus while keeping service levels high.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a stable late-spring demand regime. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand has averaged approximately 60.8 units (59, 37, 45, 79, 58, 56, 92). Although there was a slight uptick to 92 in P15, this is within the expected variance of the current regime rather than a new surge. Promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals in P14 and P15 which both showed exact 4-period lead times. On-hand inventory is 138 units, and pipeline inventory is 101 units (orders from P13 and P15). This total inventory (239 units) is approximately 3.9 weeks of supply at the current 60.8 unit average, which aligns closely with the coverage needed for a lead time of 4. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the mean and variance of this current demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has stabilized in late Spring (P9-P15): Mean weekly demand is ~61 units (range 37-92). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim) has entered a stable late-Spring regime. Over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), the demand has averaged approximately 58.4 units, ranging between 37 and 92. This is significantly lower than the February peak and represents a stabilization after the prior decline. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 92 and in-transit units at 194 (total pipeline = 286), the inventory position is adequate for the current demand regime (covering roughly 4.9 periods of mean demand). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture only the periods since the demand stabilized after the February-April decline (starting Period 9), ensuring the base stock level aligns with current sales and avoids over-ordering as we move further into the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product, 'Push Up Jegging L.W', is in a late spring/early summer regime. Demand over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) has stabilized around a mean of 56.5 units, with the most recent sample at 37 units. Comparing the late spring regime (P9-P17) to the early spring regime (P4-P8), we see a sustained decrease in demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P13 order arriving in P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 110 units and in-transit is 236 units (total pipeline = 346). Given a mean of ~56.5 across 5 periods (L+1), the target stock should be approximately 280-330 units. The pipeline is slightly above the current demand requirement, but we should maintain a steady replenishment to account for potential late June volatility. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime since Period 9 while excluding the massive February/March spikes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' shows a clear stabilization in a 'late spring/early summer' regime (Periods 9-18), with average weekly demand around 55 units. Recent demand samples (P16: 46, P17: 37, P18: 43) suggest a slight softening compared to the May average, but consistent with the late spring mean of ~55. On-hand inventory is 67, with 242 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). Promised lead time (L=4) is consistent with historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P10, P11, P13 all arrived in 4 periods). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire 'late spring' regime (P9-P18), which accurately reflects the current demand level of approximately 55 units per week. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the approximately 275-300 units required to satisfy demand and provide a safety buffer throughout the lead time, considering the pipeline is already well-stocked.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging L.W', which follows a seasonal fashion cycle. After a significant demand peak in February, demand has stabilized in a lower regime. Analysis of demand samples from Period 9 (April) through Period 19 (June) shows a mean weekly demand of approximately 53 units (range 32-92). The most recent three periods (P17-P19) have shown slightly lower than average demand (37, 43, 32), with an average of 37.3 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of orders from P10, P11, P13, and P15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 230 (composed of orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19). The pipeline is sufficient to cover the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the late spring/early summer regime since Period 9) to provide a stable forecast, and 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the reliable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a stable Summer floor (P9-P19): Mean weekly demand is ~53 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a significantly lower regime as of July 2019. In Period 20, demand dropped to a record low of 15 units. Over the last three periods (P18-P20), demand has averaged only 30 units, compared to the summer 'floor' average of 53 units identified previously. This suggests a potential deep summer trough or an end-of-season clearance phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). With on-hand inventory at 159 and 160 units in-transit (total 319), current stock levels are extremely high for the observed demand (covering over 10 periods at recent rates). I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (N=3) to minimize further ordering and allow for inventory drawdown. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has dropped significantly below the summer floor, averaging 30 units over P18-P20, with a low of 15 units in P20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a significant downward demand trend as of early July. Recent weekly demand has dropped to 15 and 20 units (P20-P21), confirming the 'summer floor' shift noted in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand 236 + in-transit 63 = 299) is extremely high relative to current demand levels; even at the previous average of 53 units, this represents nearly 6 weeks of cover. At the new lower regime (~20 units/week), this is over 14 weeks of cover. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this sharp drop in demand (averaging ~22 units/week) to prevent further over-ordering while the system naturally clears excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: Demand has dropped to a new lows (15-20 units), significantly below the previous 'summer floor' of 53 units, suggesting a late-season clearance or minimum demand floor.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (a low-waist jegging) is currently in a late summer demand trough. Demand has transitioned from a summer floor of ~53 units (P9-P19) to a new, lower regime starting around Period 20. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has been 15, 20, and 27 units respectively (mean = 20.6). We are currently carrying significant excess inventory (On-hand: 215) relative to this new demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand plus in-transit stock totaling 272 units, and a projected demand across the lead time of roughly 103 units (5 periods * ~20.6 units/period), no more orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lowest demand regime and prevent further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at a new seasonal low (P20-P22): Average weekly demand has dropped to ~21 units, down from the previous summer floor of ~53.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (658030020) is in a low-demand phase typical for July. While Period 23 saw a jump to 60 units, demand from Period 20-22 was very low (15, 20, 27). The current on-hand inventory (189) plus in-transit stock (23 units from Period 20) totals 212 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, this stock must cover the next 5 periods (L+1). Even at an optimistic forecast of 50-60 units per week, the current stock is sufficient. However, the moving average since Period 20 (recent_N where N=4) reflects the recent seasonal downturn better than the longer-term history. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend should maintain a safety stock profile that reflects the recent volatility (std) and low mean to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against unexpected demand spikes like P23.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in July (P20-P23 range: 15-60), but the overall mean remains low (avg ~30) compared to Spring levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (a denim product) is in a summer demand regime characterized by lower and more volatile sales compared to the spring peak. Recent demand data (P20-P24: 15, 20, 27, 60, 33) shows an average of 31 units per week. The inventory position is currently heavy with 179 units on-hand and 16 units in-transit (total 195 units), which covers approximately 6 weeks of current demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the significant holding cost relative to current demand levels and the fact that we are in late July (potentially approaching end-of-season for this SKU), the strategy is to allow on-hand inventory to deplete further. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture this lower late-summer demand regime while being protected against the observed volatility. No large orders should be triggered by the OR engine given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor (late June - July) confirmed: average weekly demand is ~31 units (range 15-60), significantly lower than the Spring baseline (~55-60) and February peak (~175).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). For SKU 658030020 (low-waist jeggings), historical data shows a massive peak in February (187 units) followed by a gradual stabilization into a 'summer floor' throughout June and July. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), weekly demand has averaged approximately 34 units (15, 20, 27, 60, 33, 50). While slightly more volatile than the mid-June lows, this represents a consistent late-summer regime. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages for orders placed in P19 and P20. With an on-hand inventory of 129 units and 41 units in-transit (orders from P24 and P25), the current stock position (170 units) covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current 34-unit/week rate. I will use a N=6 window to capture this current late-summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current demand level given the L=4 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P20-P25) for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' stabilized with a mean of 34 units/week and moderate volatility (range 15-60).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn transition. Recent demand (P23-P26: 60, 33, 50, 82) shows an upward trend compared to the early July lows (under 30), with P26 reaching 82 units. This suggests demand is recovering towards the spring baseline of ~60-80 units as we move into August. On-hand inventory is low (47), and while there are 105 units in transit, the recent demand spike necessitates a slightly more aggressive stocking strategy to avoid stockouts. I will use a recent_N method (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this upward movement while smoothing the July volatility (Avg ~44 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is trending upward from late-summer lows, with P26 reaching 82 units, suggesting a return to a higher demand regime (approx 50-80 units/week) as the autumn season approaches.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing a clear upward shift as we enter August (late-summer/early-autumn transition). Demand in the last two periods (P26-P27) has reached 82 and 84 units respectively, a significant increase from the July average of ~31 units. This aligns with a 'back-to-school' or seasonal transition for denim products. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 186 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To avoid further lost sales and capture this new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the recent upward trend (averaging ~72 units per week including P25). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Demand has returned to a higher baseline (80+ units/week) consistent with early autumn seasonality, up from the summer floor of ~30-35 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing an autumn demand recovery. Recent weekly demand samples (P26-P28) are 82, 84, and 67, averaging approximately 78 units, which is a significant increase from the summer floor of ~34 units. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand = 0 in P28) and lost significant sales in P27 and P28. While 274 units are in-transit, the immediate priority is to set parameters that reflect the higher demand regime (approx 80 units/week) to ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders to rebuild inventory and meet this seasonal uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current 80-unit/week baseline across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed P26-P28: mean demand increased to ~78 units/week from summer floor of ~34 (+129%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing an autumn demand recovery. Demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been 82, 84, 67, and 47, averaging 70 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer floor of ~31 units. The recent dip to 47 in P29 may be a weekly fluctuation or a tapering of the initial autumn surge, but the overall regime is higher. Crucially, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) with 342 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (Autumn) is clearly higher than the summer, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new mean (approx 70) and higher volatility. Setting L=4 (standard) and using recent data ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand recovery and current stock-out status.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a stockout situation (on-hand = 0) despite recent arrivals, due to a recovery in demand associated with the transition into autumn. Demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged 73.4 units, confirming a return to the higher autumn demand regime (approx 70-90 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) or 5 weeks of demand. Current in-transit is 349 units, which covers nearly 4.7 weeks of the 73.4 unit average, meaning the system is close to the required pipeline, but requires a small buffer to handle the stockout and volatility (range 47-87). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this specific autumn regime, and 'default' for lead time (4).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P26-P30) confirmed: Mean weekly demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is 73.4 units (range 47-87), signaling a sustained recovery from the summer floor of ~34 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing an Autumn demand recovery, with recent demand reaching 110 units in Period 31. Over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), the average demand has risen to approximately 79.6 units, up from the summer floor of ~34 and significantly higher than the previous autumn stabilization point of ~73. Currently, the SKU is facing a persistent stockout (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for the last 5 periods), meaning actual demand is likely higher than what was fulfilled. The in-transit pipeline of 348 units reflects recent aggressive ordering but has not yet fully satisfied the demand at the shelf. To address this, I will use a recent demand window (N=6, covering P26-P31) to capture the upward trend and volatility of this recovery. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The parameters are set to ensure the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficiently high to recover from stockouts and meet the new seasonal baseline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P27-P31 average demand is 79.6 units (range 47-110), with Period 31 hitting 110, signaling a stronger seasonal recovery than the earlier stabilization estimate.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim) is currently in an autumn recovery phase. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the summer floor, with the last 6 periods (P26-P31) showing an average demand of approximately 79.6 units (range 47-110). While P32 saw a slight dip to 78 units, the overall trend is sustainment of this autumn baseline. On-hand inventory is low (26 units) but bolstered by a significant pipeline (359 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P24-P28 arrivals all confirming L=4). I will use a recent_N strategy (N=6) to capture this stabilized autumn demand level while maintaining the standard lead time of 4 periods to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P32) confirmed: mean weekly demand is ~79.5 units, significantly higher than the summer floor of ~34 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a strong Autumn demand phase. Period 33 observed a significant demand of 152 units, well above the previous autumn average of ~80 units. This mirrors the high demand seen in early Spring (February), suggesting another seasonal peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 353 units in-transit. Since demand has clearly surged (averaging ~106 units over the last 3 periods: 110, 78, 152), I am shifting to recent_N (N=3) to capture this new mean levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples will allow the OR engine to react to this higher demand regime and target a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), especially as current on-hand is exhausted.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak detected: Period 33 demand reached 152 units, following a strengthening trend (P31=110). This indicates a higher demand regime than the recovery baseline of 80 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing an Autumn demand surge. While Period 33 demand reached 152 units, Period 34 demand retracted slightly to 96 units. The Autumn regime (P27-P34) shows a mean of approximately 90 units per week. However, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 7 of the last 8 periods, indicating that we are severely under-ordered relative to this seasonal peak. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the stockouts, historical demand samples may be censored (real demand could have been higher than reported 'demand' in some logic steps, but here 'demand' is explicit). I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P29-P34) to capture the higher 100+ unit average of the peak season while smoothing the Period 33 spike. Recent lead times are consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime (P31-P34) confirmed: Demand is averaging ~109 units/week (range 96-152), significantly higher than the early autumn recovery baseline of 80 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing an autumn demand surge. Despite the carry-over insight noting a peak mean of 109, recent demand has been volatile, with a local peak of 152 in Period 33 followed by a dip to 78 in Period 35. This indicates high variance. On-hand inventory is critically low (2 units), although a large pipeline (524 units) is in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P31-P35) to capture this recent autumn peak regime (avg ~103 units), and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the increased volatility (std ~30). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1), which will likely trigger additional orders to maintain the service level given the low current on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a peak of 152 units in Period 33, demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) with values of 96, 78, and 71, averaging 81.67 units/week. This is a significant drop from the 'Autumn Peak' described in carry-over insights (avg 109) but remains higher than the summer floor. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the last 3 stabilized periods) to reflect this cooling-off period while maintaining adequate stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (46), but there is a substantial pipeline of 510 units, with 87 units expected to arrive this period (ordered P33). Setting parameters to target this stabilized mean of ~82 units/week ensures we don't over-order during a post-peak decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Demand has moderated from the Period 33 peak (152) to an average of ~82 units/week over P34-P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is in a post-autumn peak stabilization phase. After a peak of 152 in Period 33, demand has moderated over the last four periods (P34-P37) to 96, 78, 71, and 64 respectively. This suggests the demand regime has shifted from the peak average of ~109 down to approximately 77 units per week. The L=4 lead time remains highly consistent. Currently, there are 69 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 423 units (ordered during the high-demand periods 34-36). Given the current demand forecast of ~77 units/week, the base stock requirement for (L+1=5) periods is roughly 385 units. With pipeline inventory (423) already exceeding this, no new order is required. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the downward stabilization and ensure the OR backend recognizes the sufficient pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime confirmed (P34-P37): demand has stabilized at an average of 77.25 units/week, down from the Period 33 peak of 152.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is in a post-autumn peak stabilization phase. The peak occurred around Period 33 (demand=152), but demand has since moderated and stabilized. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 78.2 units (range 64-82), showing very low volatility across the most recent four weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 162 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 248 units (orders from P35, P36). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as evidenced by recent 'conclude' messages. Given the stable demand regime and high pipeline levels, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for both demand mean and volatility calculation. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the recent stabilization at ~78 units/week while factoring in the larger historical standard deviation from the peak to maintain a safe service level.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a post-autumn peak stabilization phase. The peak occurred around Period 33 (demand=152), and demand has since moderated and stabilized. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 74.5 units (96, 78, 71, 64, 82, 56), showing a gradual decline towards late-year levels. Period 39 demand was 56, the lowest in this recent regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P31-P35 orders). On-hand inventory is currently high (253 units) due to recent large arrivals from orders placed during the autumn peak, and there are 127 units in-transit (orders from P36 and P39). Given the downward trend as we enter mid-November, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect the 74.5 mean, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the softening demand while preventing excessive overstocking during this stabilization phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (P34-P39) confirmed: demand has moderated from a peak of 152 to a mean of 74.5 units/week with a downward trend (P39 = 56).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a post-autumn stabilization phase. Recent demand (P36-P40) has averaged 66.6 units per week (71, 64, 82, 56, 60), which is a step down from the autumn peak. The carrying over insight from P40 notes a downward trend confirmed by P39 and P40. Current on-hand inventory is 294 units, with 71 units in-transit (ordered P39 and P40). The total pipeline plus on-hand (365 units) is quite high compared to the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (P36-P40) to align with the post-peak stabilization level (avg ~67), and default for other parameters to manage the current inventory surplus gently.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime stabilized (P36-P40): mean weekly demand is approximately 67 units, down from the October peak averages.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a post-autumn stabilization phase. Demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) has been 64, 82, 56, 60, and 52, averaging ~63 units/week. This represents a clear shift from the October peak (which averaged ~109 units/week in P31-P34). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P37-P41) to capture this moderate, stabilized demand level (~63 * 5 = 315). Although the current on-hand inventory (242) and in-transit (174) are relatively high compared to recent demand, lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods. Using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility allows the OR backend to adjust order quantities downwards to prevent excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the year, while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn stabilization confirmed (P37-P41): Demand has moderated to a mean of 62.8 units/week, significantly lower than the October peak of 109 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. The SKU is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a denim product. Historically, this product saw a major peak in February (~175 units) and a secondary peak in late September/October (~152 units). Following the autumn peak, demand has stabilized and is now trending lower as we enter December. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 63.2 units (range 52-82). Most recently (P42), demand was 66. The autumn stock-up phase resulted in high inventory, with 176 on-hand and 174 in-transit (total 350). The 'in-transit' includes orders from P39 (26 units), P40 (45 units), and P41 (103 units). Based on confirmed lead time of 4 periods, P39 will arrive in P43, P40 in P44, and P41 in P45. Given the current demand regime of ~63 units, 350 units cover roughly 5.5 periods, which is sufficient for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand and sigma to capture the post-autumn stabilization while acknowledging the gradual decline towards winter levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand (P38-P42) has stabilized at a mean of ~63 units/week, down from the October high of ~110. Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has stabilized into a late-year regime. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 55.8 units (56, 60, 52, 66, 45), appearing relatively stable after the autumn peak. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P39 order arriving in P43). Current inventory position is comfortable with 157 on-hand and 274 in-transit. With 4 periods of lead time, the total pipeline plus on-hand should cover 5 periods of demand (approx 279 units). Total current position is 431 units, which is a surplus for the current regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand mean (55.8) and standard deviation for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, I will continue with the proven calculate method as lead times have been highly consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime (P39-P43) confirmed: mean weekly demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has stabilized at 55.8 units, reflecting the transition towards the winter season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1778.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a late-year stabilization phase. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged approximately 63 units per week, despite a recent outlier of 99 in Period 44. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 44 correctly identified a stabilized mean around 55-60 units. As we approach the end of the year (Dec 16), demand is expected to remain consistent with this winter baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline (on-hand 103 + in-transit 229 = 332) effectively covers over 5 weeks of demand at the current average (332 / 63 \u2248 5.2 periods), so I will use a recent_N approach to maintain this stability. I'll set N=6 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-autumn stabilization (P39-P44) and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility introduced by the P44 spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing a significant demand surge in late December (Periods 44 and 45), with demand hitting 99 and 106 units respectively. This is a sharp increase from the late-autumn regime of ~56 units, likely driven by holiday shopping and transition to winter sales. On-hand inventory is currently at 100 units, and there are 179 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). The current mean demand based on this recent spike is approximately 102.5 units over the last 2 weeks (P44-P45), whereas the broader winter regime (P39-P45) averages ~76 units. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand holiday period, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture both the stabilizing autumn levels and the recent surge, while setting sigma_hat with N=7 to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected in late December (P44-P45): mean demand increased to 102.5 units from a late-autumn baseline of 56 units (+83%).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, right after the Christmas/Holiday peak for 'Push Up Jegging L.W'. Historically, demand surged in late December (P44-P45: 99, 106 units) and began to subside in P46 (85 units). We are entering the post-holiday period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrival history. Demand for the last 3 periods (P44-P46) averaged 96.7 units. However, looking back to early January last year (see Historical Demand), demand was lower (~35-42), but then spiked significantly in February (166). Given this is a jegging product, we should expect a post-holiday lull followed by a potential spring transition surge. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (15 units) after the holiday sales, but in-transit inventory is high (288 units), primarily from large orders in P43 and P45-46. We choose recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent high volume while allowing the OR backend to normalize, and sigma_hat with N=3 to account for recent holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand moderation detected at Period 47: demand decreased from peak (106) to 85. Winter baseline (P44-P46) mean is 96.7 units.
