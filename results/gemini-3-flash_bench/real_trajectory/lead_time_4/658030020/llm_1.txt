Historical data shows a massive demand spike on 2019-02-04 (166 units) compared to the January average (~45 units). This aligns with the lead-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which falls in the current Period 1. High demand is expected to persist through the current period. Demand Regime: January average was ~45 units/week. February saw a +270% jump. I expect demand for the next few weeks to remain elevated due to early spring shopping and post-Valentine's trends, though it may stabilize lower than the 166 peak. Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am currently facing a total stockout. Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1 (unavoidable stockout), plus Periods 2, 3, 4, 5 (while the order is in transit). Total demand to cover: 5 periods. Estimating demand at ~100 units/period (average of recent peak and Jan baseline) to balance service level and holding cost. Total desired pipeline = 5 periods * 100 units = 500 units.",

Current demand (Period 13: 58, Period 14: 56) supports a regime of approximately 50-60 units/week. On-hand inventory is 425 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Periods 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 (L+1 approach). At a conservative estimate of 60 units/week, the required stock to cover 5 periods is 300 units. Since on-hand inventory is already 425 units, which is enough to cover over 7-8 weeks of current demand, placing an order now would only increase unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) for a product likely entering a seasonal trough in early summer. I will continue to deplete existing stock.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a denim item which typically sees higher demand during the transition to autumn (late August/September). Current demand history shows a regime shift from the mid-summer low (~20-30 units) to an autumn ramp-up (~47-84 units in recent weeks). Period 29 demand (47) was lower than P27/P28 (84/67), but stockouts occurred in P29 (ending inventory 0), likely censoring the true demand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My pipeline consists of orders from P26 (100 arrive in P30), P27 (250 arrive in P31), P28 (50 arrive in P32), and P29 (100 arrive in P33). Total in-transit is 500 units. Our current on-hand is 0. With demand expected to stay in the 60-80 range for the autumn season, the existing pipeline of 500 units covers approximately 6-8 weeks of demand starting from Period 30. Total inventory + pipeline (500) against an expected 5-period demand (P30-P34) of approx 350-400 units (using an avg of 75/week) suggests we are currently well-covered. I will place a moderate order of 50 units to maintain the pipeline as the P26 delivery arrives, ensuring we don't under-order if autumn demand peaks higher.",

Since we have only 13 units on-hand and recent demand is ~85 units, we are at risk of stockouts. Pipeline analysis: P27 order (250) is due P31 (Arrival Resolution), P28 order (50) is due P32, P29 order (100) is due P33, and P30 order (50) is due P34. Current total in-transit is 450 units. To cover the next 5 periods (L+1), we expect a demand of approximately 425 units (85 x 5). Our current pipeline of 463 (13 on-hand + 450 in-transit) covers this projected demand. However, given the seasonal strength of denim in September and to maintain a safety buffer against the volatile nature of autumn shopping, a small replenishment order is prudent to ensure the pipeline remains full as we move deeper into the fall season.",

{
  "rationale": "We are in the liquidation phase (Period 44 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 304 units. There are 4 periods remaining (44, 45, 46, 47). Recent demand from Periods 39 to 43 has been 56, 60, 52, 66, and 45, averaging approximately 56 units per week. Total expected demand for the final 4 periods is roughly 224 units (56 units/week * 4 weeks). With 304 units currently on hand and no further incoming shipments, the inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and reduce total profit, as any leftover inventory at the end of Period 47 provides no value.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are in the final stages of the game (Period 45 of 47). The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim), which saw a peak in September/October and is now in a late-autumn/early-winter deceleration phase, despite a temporary spike in Period 44 (99 units, likely due to holiday promotions). With the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's conclusion (Period 47). Therefore, we must fulfill all remaining demand from the current on-hand inventory of 205 units. Given recent demand trends (averaging roughly 60-70 units per week over the last five periods: 52, 66, 45, 99), the 205 units on hand provide approximately 3 periods of cover. This aligns perfectly with the remaining periods in the simulation (45, 46, and 47). Ordering more would result in stranded inventory and unnecessary holding costs without any opportunity for sales.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the game. (a) World knowledge: The date is December 23rd, 2019. This is the peak of the Christmas and holiday shopping season, which explains the significant demand spikes observed in Periods 44 (99 units) and 45 (106 units). (b) Demand regime: While demand was previously in a late-autumn decline (~50-60 units), it doubled in the last two weeks due to holiday shopping. Given that Period 46 covers the immediate Christmas week and Period 47 is the final period (likely covering Year-End/Boxing Day sales), demand is expected to remain high, likely between 80-110 units. (c) Lead time: Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Any order placed now in Period 46 would not arrive until Period 50, which is beyond the game's horizon (Period 47). (d) Inventory & pipeline: Currently on-hand is 99 units. In-transit is 0. (e) Final logic: Since any new order cannot arrive before the game ends, and the current on-hand inventory of 99 units is roughly sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final weeks without incurring excessive holding costs or missing significant sales, the optimal action is to place no order. Ordering now would only incur a cost without providing inventory that can be sold.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand peak confirmed for late December: Demand increased from a ~50-60 baseline to ~100 units/week (P44-45) due to Christmas seasonality.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are now at Period 47 (2019/12/30), which is the final period of the simulation. At the conclusion of this period, the game ends. In the previous period (P46), the holiday demand surge peaked and then began slightly receding (from 106 to 85 units), but still remained well above the autumn baseline. We currently have 14 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any order placed today would only arrive in Period 51, far beyond the end of the simulation. Therefore, any order placed now would only incur a cost without ever being available to satisfy demand. The objective is to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory costs. Since current on-hand inventory (14) is already very low and unlikely to even satisfy the expected demand for this final period (estimated between 60-90 units), we will sell out of the remaining 14 units, ending with zero inventory and zero holding cost. No further orders are rational.",
