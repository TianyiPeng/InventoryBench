Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 470789001 (Women's Lingerie). On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 92.4 and a standard deviation of 15.6. The product is microfibre Brazilian briefs, which are staple items but might see slight variations. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised 4 periods). For the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent information from the provided history (Jan/Feb context). This ensures the base stock (L+1 = 5 periods of demand) is set to approximately 5 * 92.4 plus a safety buffer to account for the profit/holding cost ratio (z* = 0 where profit=holding).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's lingerie item. Looking at the historical demand (97, 69, 105, 87, 104) and Period 1 demand (76), the mean demand is approximately 89.67 units per week. There is no clear seasonal shift yet, although we are moving further into February. In Period 1, we ordered 117 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, they have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is normal for L=4). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 117 units in-transit. Since on-hand is 0 and we had demand of 76 in Period 1, we have lost sales. To calculate parameters: Mean = 89.67. Standard Deviation of the 6 samples is approx 15.6. Promised L=4. mu_hat should cover L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 89.67 = 448.35. sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 15.6 = 34.88. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (all available samples) to capture the current stable demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 and 2 are still in transit (promised lead time is 4 periods). Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods (97, 69, 105, 87, 104) and 2 game periods (76, 129) shows a mean of ~95. The product is Women's Lingerie (Microfibre Brazilian briefs), which typically shows stable demand but can fluctuate. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat incorporates all available data (pre-game + game) to establish a stable baseline. Lead time 'L' remains at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Brazilian briefs' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (P1) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of P5 and will be visible in the P5 conclude message (accessible in P6). As predicted by the timing rules, 'arrived=0' in periods 1-3 is normal. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in 100% lost sales since P1. Historical demand (5 weeks pre-game: 97, 69, 105, 87, 104) and game demand (76, 129, 108) show a stable mean of approximately 97 units/week with moderate volatility. Since the pipeline (361 units) is roughly covering the expected lead time demand (L+1 = 5 periods), but on-hand is zero, we must maintain robust base stocks to recover from the stockout as soon as shipments arrive. I will use the last 8 weeks of demand data (5 pre-game + 3 in-game) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time 'L' since no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a womens lingerie item (Brazilian briefs). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, on-hand inventory has been 0 for all completed periods, resulting in 0 units sold and significant lost demand. Historical demand samples (97, 69, 105, 87, 104) and recent observed demand (76, 129, 108, 92) suggest a mean demand of approximately 96 units per period. Since no orders have reached the 'concluded' stage yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time of 4. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while we wait for the first shipment to arrive and satisfy the backlogged demand potential.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is 35, and we have a pipeline of 392 units. Demand has been relatively stable: historical samples show a mean of 92.4, and the last 5 periods show a mean of 97.4. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the backend's default service level (q = 0.5) will target a base stock that covers roughly the median demand. Since on-hand is low, but the pipeline is high (covering roughly 4 weeks of demand), the logic will moderate the new order size. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the slightly higher recent demand (97.4) compared to the long-term average (92.4), and 'default' for sigma_hat as there is no significant change in volatility detected. Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demand for this Women's Lingerie item (Brazilian briefs) shows a mean of approximately 95 units per week (samples: 97, 69, 105, 87, 104, 76, 129, 108, 92, 82, 86). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P5 saw P1's arrival, P6 saw P2's arrival). The pipeline is healthy with 337 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). On-hand inventory is 64. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock to cover this window. Demand appears stable without clear seasonal shifts in this early spring window, so I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), historical demand (samples + P1-P7) for this Brazilian Low Brief shows a consistent mean around 94.7 units per period. The recent demand regime (last 4 periods: 92, 82, 86, 103) is stable. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P5, P6, P7 arrivals all show L=4). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 285 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 90 units. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods. Given the stable demand and confirmed lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend utilize the observed 4-period consistency.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie staple (Brazilian briefs). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). Since lead time is stable, I will use the 'calculate' method. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) showing a mean of 94.2 and the total historical mean (including pre-game samples) being approximately 93.9. There are no major upcoming holidays in early April for this category that would suggest a significant spike. Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand behavior (post-initial variability). The on-hand inventory is 106, with 257 in transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). The backend will calculate the order based on a 5-period window (L+1), which is approximately 470 units total need.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's lingerie item (Brazilian briefs). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P5 order arrived P9). The lead time remains stable at L=4. Demand history shows relative stability with the last 5 samples being 82, 86, 103, 108, and 67 (mean \u2248 89.2). The drop to 67 in P9 may be a minor fluctuation or post-Easter dip, but overall demand is consistent with the pre-game samples (97, 69, 105, 87, 104). Holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), implying a high target service level (q = 0.5 for the base stock formula, though OR backend utilizes this in a specific way). On-hand inventory is 63, and there are 341 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Expected arrivals for P10 are the units ordered in P6 (60 units). I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent regime (N=9 since start of game history), keeping L at the default promised value which matches observation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product is women's microfibre Brazilian briefs. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on history (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last three weeks (67, 66, and demand from the most recent conclusion). Calculating mean demand from the 5 preceding weeks (P6-P10) gives an average of (86+103+108+67+66)/5 = 86 units per period. Using a lead time of 4, the target window (L+1) is 5 periods. mu_hat should target approximately 5 * 86 = 430 units. sigma_hat will be estimated using recent volatility to avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for this low-cost/high-profit ratio (Profit $1, Holding $1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Historical demand (Periods 1-11) shows an average of 94 units with standard deviation ~18. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously identified. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, and we have 296 units in transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). The most recent demand (P11) was 117, slightly above average but within normal variance. There is no clear seasonal shift or regime change visible in the demand for this 'Brazilian briefs' product in April. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full observed demand history of this game, and lead time 'L' will remain at the confirmed default of 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 6, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (Brazilian briefs). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P8 arrived P12), matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows some fluctuation but no clear regime shift yet (avg demand around 90-95). In-transit inventory (329 units) represents orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12, which are expected to arrive in P13, P14, P15, and P16 respectively. Current on-hand is 48. Total pipeline plus on-hand is 377. Given L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At an average demand of ~90, 5 periods equals ~450 units. The current total is slightly below this. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are stable at 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the observable sales history from P5-P12) to capture the most relevant recent consumer behavior without being overly sensitive to the single-period dip in P12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. The product is a staple item (Brazilian briefs). Analysis of the last 13 periods shows demand is relatively stable but fluctuates around a mean of 91.07 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5 through 13). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown higher variance (65, 117, 65, 85, and current average of ~87), but no clear seasonal regime shift is evident yet. I will set L to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stabilized demand pattern seen since the initial inventory stock-up phase concluded, ensuring we cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P15 (2019-05-20). Historical demand samples and recent performance show a relatively stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 88 units per week (P1-P14 avg: 91, P10-P14 avg: 84). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory status is healthy: On-hand (52) + In-transit (296) = 348 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets a window of (L+1)=5 periods. 5 periods * 88 units/period = 440 units total pipeline. The current total inventory of 348 units suggests the system will place an order of roughly 92 units to reach the stocking target. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability, and calculate for L to leverage the consistent 4-period arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a major demand spike (179 units vs. average ~90), resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike aligns with late May, likely driven by seasonal factors or promotions for women's lingerie (Microfibre Brazilian briefs). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as seen in arrivals for Periods 5-15. Currently, we have 359 units in-transit: Period 12 order (129), Period 13 (57), Period 14 (87), and Period 15 (86). The Period 12 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 16. To recover from the stockout and prepare for potentially higher sustained demand, I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat. This focuses on the most recent 4 periods which includes the spike and preceding weeks (85, 88, 179 + current estimate), and explicit sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 15 (179 units, +100% vs previous average). Monitoring if this initiates a new summer/seasonal regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 17 (2019/6/3). The demand in Period 15 was 179 and Period 16 was 182, confirming a significant regime shift compared to the previous average of ~85-90. This likely reflects seasonal demand for 'Brazilian briefs with laser-cut edges' as summer begins. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 368 units in transit. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since we have two consecutive periods of elevated demand (179 and 182), I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this new regime. Using an explicit value based on the (1+L) * forecast (where L=4, so 5 periods * ~180) to ensure the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to meet this new summer demand level, while keeping sigma_hat slightly elevated to handle the volatility of the shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed starting Period 15 (~180 units/week), likely seasonal summer demand for lingerie/briefs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). Demand has experienced a significant structural shift upward starting in Period 15, likely due to summer seasonality for lingerie/briefs. The last three periods of demand were 179, 182, and 149 (average ~170), compared to the previous average of ~90. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite consistent arrivals because the orders placed 4 periods ago were based on the old demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand period, I am setting L to 4 and using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-mean, high-variance regime. This will signal the OR backend to increase the base stock level significantly to cover the (L+1) window of ~170 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. The product (Womens Lingerie) entered a significantly higher demand regime starting Period 15, likely due to summer seasonality. Demand from P15 to P18 has been 179, 182, 149, and 116 (average ~156.5). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand has been 0 for 4 periods) because previous orders were based on the old demand mean (~85-90). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. To capture the recent shift while accounting for the slight cooling observed in P17-P18, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to focus on the high-demand summer regime. I will specify an explicit L=4 for stability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility of this higher demand period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (June 24). Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a significant demand shift starting around Period 15 (mid-May), which matches a seasonal summer peak for women's lingerie/briefs. Demand since Period 15 has averaged approximately 151 units (179, 182, 149, 116, 147), which is a substantial increase from the initial average of ~90. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals (ordered before the spike) are insufficient to meet this higher demand regime. To stabilize inventory, we need to set our parameters based on this new regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand mean and variance of this summer peak. This will raise the base stock level (mu_hat for L+1=5 periods) to restore service levels and prevent further lost sales during the high-demand season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) is currently in a sustained summer peak demand regime that began around Period 15 (May 20th). Since Period 15, the average weekly demand has risen to approximately 157 units, compared to the spring average of ~85. The goal is to set the OR parameters to cover this higher demand over the lead time (L=4) plus one review period (total 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced several stockouts recently because the pipeline was still calibrated to the old demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclusions. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer demand (Period 15-20) and recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this peak period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting in Period 15 (May 20), consistent with seasonal summer demand for lingerie/briefs. While the initial spike reached ~180 units, the average over the last 7 periods (P15-P21) is approximately 152 units per period. The most recent demand (P21) dropped to 121, suggesting the early summer peak may be stabilizing or slightly cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this higher summer regime while accounting for the recent variance/moderation. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect the higher volatility observed in this regime. Pipeline inventory (104 on-hand + 559 in-transit = 663) is currently covering about 4.3 periods of the 152-unit average, so parameters will likely trigger a maintainance order.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (July 15). The product (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) entered a high-demand regime around Period 15 (mid-May), with demand peaking near 180 units. However, recent demand in Periods 21 (121) and 22 (73) suggests the peak of the summer surge may be tapering off or returning to a more moderate level. The average demand over the last 8 periods (since the regime shift in P15) is 141.75 units, but the average of the last 3 periods is 120.3, and the most recent sample is significantly lower (73). To avoid overstocking as the season potentially cools, I will use a window of N=5 for demand forecasting (covering Periods 18-22), which captures the end of the peak and the recent decline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the OR target is a 50% service level, which essentially targets the median (mean) demand over the lead time + review period. On-hand (232) and In-transit (453) are relatively high due to the recent large orders placed to catch the June peak finally arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 15; Period 22 shows a significant drop (73 units) from the June peak (~180 units), suggesting a possible end to the summer demand surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-227.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted again. After a summer peak (approx. Periods 15-21) where demand averaged ~150 units, the last three periods (P21-P23) have shown a sharp decline: 121, 73, and 69 units respectively. This suggests the end of the seasonal surge for this 'Microfibre Brazilian briefs' SKU as we move into late July. Currently, we have 296 units on-hand and 320 in-transit, totaling 616 units. Given the recent drop, using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) will capture this recent downward trend (average ~88 units) better than longer-term averages. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 3 weeks will prevent excessive over-ordering while we work through the current high inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Summer peak (~150 units) ended around Period 21; new lower demand regime (~85 units) established over the last 3 periods (P21-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019-07-29), the SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) has exited its summer peak demand phase. Demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) has been 121, 73, 69, and 61, averaging roughly 81 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (P15-P20) which averaged ~157 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 311 units and there are 244 units in-transit (orders from P21-P22). With actual lead time confirmed consistently at 4 periods, total inventory coverage (on-hand + pipeline) is 555 units. Given the new demand regime of ~80 units per week, 555 units represents nearly 7 weeks of supply. To avoid excessive holding costs in a post-peak period, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the recent lower demand trend. Sigma_hat is also updated to N=4 to capture the current volatility correctly. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly stable.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently overstocked with an ending on-hand inventory of 401 units, while the recent demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 60-70 units per week (Period 22-25: 73, 69, 61, 59). Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 496 units, which covers over 7 weeks of demand at the current average. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the profit ($1.0/unit) and the current oversupply, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this lower demand environment to avoid placing unnecessary additional orders. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the post-summer decline (Periods 21-25), yielding an average demand of approximately 76 units, which is much more appropriate than the all-history average.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 22-25 average ~65 units/week, a ~60% decrease from the June peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 has stabilized at a lower post-summer level. Following the peak in June (~150-180 units/week), the last five periods (P22-P26) have recorded demands of 73, 69, 61, 59, and 76, averaging approximately 67.6 units per week. This confirms the regime shift identified in Period 24. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 420 units with zero units in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods (L=4) and an review period of 1, the system aims to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate, 5 periods requirement is ~338 units (5 * 67.6). Since current on-hand inventory (420) already exceeds this requirement and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a 50% service level target), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stabilized demand (recent_N=5) and lead time remains consistent at 4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (P15-P21, avg ~150) into a lower late-summer/autumn regime. Over the last six periods (P22-P27), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 64 units per week (min 46, max 76). With on-hand inventory at 374 units and zero in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand (covering approx. 5.8 weeks). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), minimizing excess ending inventory is critical. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P22 order arrived P26). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this stabilized post-peak demand and use the default lead time setting. No new orders will likely be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). The historical data confirms that the summer peak (~150 units/week) ended around Period 21. Since Period 22, the demand has transitioned to a lower post-summer regime. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P22-P28) show demand values of 73, 69, 61, 59, 76, 46, and 98, averaging approximately 68.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 276 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 periods * 69 units = 345 units. Our current inventory (276) is slightly below this target, but we have had high holding costs recently due to the inventory surge following the summer peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer demand regime while avoiding over-ordering as we move into autumn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P30 (early September). Historical data shows the summer demand surge for this lingerie SKU has dissipated. Over the last 8 periods (P22-P29), demand has averaged 75.25 units per week, though the last two weeks (P28-P29) showed a slight upward tick to 98 and 120 units respectively, possibly due to 'back to school' or end-of-summer promotions. On-hand inventory is 156 units and in-transit is 69 units (total pipeline 225). With a lead time of 4 periods and a target coverage of L+1 (5 periods), the current pipeline covers approximately 3 weeks of the recent average demand (~75). However, given the recent bounce in demand, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-peak regime while allowing for the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. In recent periods (P26-P30), demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime. While the summer peak (June/July) reached nearly 180 units/week, the last five periods (P26-P30) have averaged approximately 84 units (46, 98, 120, 82, and P26's 76). The demand in P29 and P30 shows a slight uptick from the August lows, suggesting the stabilization around a 80-90 unit mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods based on all history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 74 units, and in-transit is 184 units (orders from P29 and P30). With (L+1) = 5 periods to cover, and a mean demand around 85, we need a pipeline total of roughly 425 units. Our current total position (On-hand 74 + In-transit 184) is 258 units, indicating a need for additional ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current post-summer stabilization while accounting for the recent moderate volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Womens Lingerie briefs) is currently in a post-summer stabilization phase. After a significant peak in June/July reaching ~180 units/week, demand has stabilized in a lower regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is approximately 73 units, though recent weeks (P29-P31) show a slight uptick to 82 units on average. On-hand inventory is currently low (30 units) following a long period where no orders were placed (P23-P28) to burn through excess stock. However, a significant pipeline of 314 units is now in transit (ordered P29-P31), with the first of these (from P29) expected to arrive in Period 33 based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current post-peak demand regime (averaging ~73 units/period) while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at 4 periods as consistently observed.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-23. We are entering the fall season. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 334 units (ordered between P29-P32). Demand has significantly slowed down from the summer peak, with June-July averaging ~150 units, and the most recent 11 weeks (since P22) averaging ~69 units. The last 4 weeks (P29-P32) specifically show a mean demand of 69.75 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since my pipeline (334) already covers nearly 5 weeks of current average demand (69 * 4.8), and my on-hand is 0, I need to ensure the parameters don't trigger massive over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer for the current regime. I will use the last 11 samples (since the post-summer drop in P22) to define the current demand regime (N=11), as this captures the stabilization better than the full history or just the very recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand from Period 22 to 32 averages 68.9 units/week, down from the June/July peak of ~150 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (microfibre briefs) is currently in a stabilized post-summer demand regime. Since Period 22 (July 8), demand has cooled significantly from summer peaks of ~150-180 units to a more stable range. Over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), the average demand is approximately 68.9 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P30-P33) show demand of 82, 44, 33, and 46, yielding a mean of 51.25. However, earlier 'post-peak' weeks were higher (e.g., P29 was 120). To be safe against stockouts while recognizing the downward trend, I will use a N=12 window to capture the full post-summer stabilization phase (incorporating the volatility seen in August/September). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (23), but there is a significant pipeline (277 units) which should begin arriving soon (P30's order is due next period). Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=12, and sigma_hat with recent_N=12 to align with this stabilized regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P31-P34) show demand of 44, 33, 46, and 47, averaging ~42.5. This is slightly lower than the Period 22-34 average of ~64. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P33 and P34 conclusions). Our current on-hand inventory is 91, and in-transit is 199 (orders from P31-P34). Total pipeline focus: We have orders of 130 (P31), 20 (P32), 12 (P33), and 37 (P34) coming. P31's arrival is expected next period. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (~42.5 units/week), ensuring we don't over-order while maintaining coverage for the 5-period window (L+1). L is set to default as the promised 4 periods matches observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand has further cooled: Periods 31-34 average 42.5 units/week, down from the 65-70 average seen earlier in the autumn transition.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for this lingerie SKU has significantly cooled following the summer peak (which reached ~180 units). Recent history shows a clear downward shift: Periods 31-35 have seen demands of 44, 33, 46, 47, and 36, averaging 41.2 units per week. This aligns with the 'post-summer cooling' documented in the most recent carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with orders from P29, P30, and P31 all arriving exactly on schedule. On-hand inventory is currently high at 185 units, which covers more than 4 weeks of the current demand regime. With 69 units still in-transit (ordered P32-P34), the total pipeline + on-hand is roughly 254 units. Given the low current demand (~41/week) and high inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this more conservative autumn baseline. This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the observed 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 has stabilized in a lower autumn regime. The most recent demand samples (P31: 44, P32: 33, P33: 46, P34: 47, P35: 36, P36: 30) yield an average of approximately 39.3 units per week. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 35, which noted a transition to ~42.5 units/week. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 175 units, with 49 units in-transit (12 units from P33 and 37 units from P34). Total pipeline inventory is 224 (175 + 49). To protect against stockouts while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1)=5 period window based on the last 6 observations (N=6). This results in a forecast of 5 * 39.3 = 196.5. Since the current pipeline (224) exceeds this base stock requirement, the system will correctly place zero or minimal orders to bleed off excess inventory and reduce holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-28. We are in a low-demand regime for this SKU (Microfibre Brazilian briefs), following the summer peak. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) shows an average of 38.5 units/week (values: 44, 33, 46, 47, 36, 30, 44), which is consistent with the cooler autumn demand noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 143 units on-hand and 37 units in-transit (total pipeline = 180), and an estimated lead time + review period demand of approximately 193 units (5 * 38.5), the inventory position is nearly balanced. To fine-tune for the current regime and avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent_N method (N=7) for both demand mean and volatility to reflect the current stabilized autumn levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) is currently in a stable low-demand regime following the summer peak. Demand over the last 8 periods (P31-P38) has averaged 38.75 units per week, significantly lower than earlier in the year. The current on-hand inventory (146 units) plus in-transit (20 units) provides approximately 4.3 periods of cover at current demand levels. Given the lead time (L=4) and the upcoming late autumn/early winter season (typically lower for this specific style until pre-holiday spikes), I will maintain the 'recent_N' approach to capture the current cooling trend. N=8 is used for mu_hat to stabilize the forecast against recent minor fluctuations (30-47 units). Sigma_hat also uses N=8 to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime solidified: Periods 31-38 average 38.75 units/week, representing the stable post-summer baseline for this SKU.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Brazilian briefs) has entered a stable, low-demand regime following its summer peak. The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand over the last 9 periods (P31-P39) has averaged 38.1 units/week, significantly lower than the ~150 units seen in June/July. The last four periods specifically show very stable demand (44, 34, 29). I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture this post-summer baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (117) plus in-transit (51) is 168 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand (~38 * 4.4 = 167.2). A small order was triggered in Period 39 (31 units). I will maintain the recent_N setting to ensure the OR backend aligns with this lower demand baseline and avoids over-ordering as we head into the later part of the year.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The SKU is a basic lingerie item (microfibre briefs). Demand has stabilized in a low-volume regime following the summer peak. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the weekly demand mean is 38.0 units with a standard deviation of 6.6 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show an even lower average of 34.8 units. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low-demand environment while maintaining a small buffer for slight volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent completed cycles. Current on-hand (80) plus in-transit (74) equals 154 units, which covers approximately 4 weeks of current demand. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1) is 5 weeks (~190 units). The OR backend will order appropriately to bridge this small gap.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand for this women's lingerie SKU shows a distinct seasonality, with a significant peak during the summer (June-July) followed by a cooling period. Since Period 31, demand has stabilized into a low-volume regime. The last 11 periods (P31-P41) show an average demand of approximately 37.4 units/week. Recent weeks (P39-P41) have shown a slight uptick (29, 37, 48), but it is too early to call a significant regime shift. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 32 units, and pipeline inventory is 110 units (ordered in P38, P39, P40, and P41). Since lead time L=4, my base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 11-period average (~37.4), expected demand for 5 periods is ~187 units. Current total position (on-hand + in-transit) is 142 units. Given the slightly rising demand in the last three weeks, I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to set safety stock based on the variance of this period. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand Jump to 91 units in Period 42 (Black Friday week) caused a stockout, as on-hand inventory was only 52. This spike is significant compared to the previous 8-week average of ~38 units. Historically, after Black Friday, demand often remains elevated for holiday shopping or returns to baseline until the Christmas peak. Given the current date is Dec 2, we are in the pre-Christmas period. The 'In-transit' of 141 units represents orders from P39 (31), P40 (23), P41 (36), and P42 (51). Since lead time is consistently 4 periods, these will arrive in P43, P44, P45, and P46 respectively. Currently, on-hand is 0. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture the baseline but also the recent upward volatility, and 'calculate' for lead time as it has been stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand spike (91 units) corresponds to Black Friday; monitoring for sustained holiday elevation through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (91 units) coinciding with Black Friday, and Period 43 demand (59 units) remains elevated compared to the pre-holiday baseline (~38 units). We are currently stocked out on-hand (0 units) because recent arrivals (P38 and P39 orders) were insufficient to cover this seasonal surge. The in-transit pipeline (181 units) contains orders from P40-P43. We need to maintain higher inventory to capture the remaining December demand and potential Christmas peaks. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the holiday uplift while using a conservative sigma_hat to manage volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42-43 demand averaged 75 units, a ~90% increase over the Nov baseline (~39 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the height of the December holiday season (Dec 16). The last three periods (P42-P44) have shown a clear holiday surge with demands of 91, 59, and 103 units respectively, averaging 84.3 units/week. This is a significant increase over the November baseline of ~39 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in the last three periods, though 261 units are in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now (P45) will arrive in P49, which is post-Christmas/New Year. Historically, this SKU saw high demand in the summer but stabilized at lower levels in autumn. The holiday spike is expected to persist for the next 1-2 periods before potentially dropping in January. To capture the remaining holiday demand and ensure recovery from the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current 84.3 average, and increasing sigma_hat (recent_N=10) to account for the heightened volatility seen during demand transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak reached: Periods 42-44 average 84.3 units/week, triple the November baseline. Anticipate seasonal drop-off starting Period 47 (Jan).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday season (late December). Historical demand for this period (Periods 42-45) shows a significant holiday surge, with demand averaging 86.75 units/week (Periods 42: 91, 43: 59, 44: 103, 45: 94). This is a dramatic increase from the November baseline of ~39 units. As we move into Period 46 (Dec 23) and Period 47 (Dec 30), we expect demand to remain high but potentially begin a seasonal decline as we enter January. However, to ensure availability and account for current stockouts (on-hand is 0), I will maintain the holiday demand parameters for another period. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this current holiday regime (approx 87 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle: a summer peak (May-July), a low autumn baseline (~39 units), and a holiday surge that began in late November (Black Friday). Demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has been significantly elevated (91, 59, 103, 94, 79), averaging 85.2 units. However, based on the retail calendar, holiday demand typically drops sharply in early January. To avoid over-ordering for the upcoming post-holiday low-demand period, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 10-period window. This window (P37-P46) includes both the pre-holiday baseline and the holiday peak, providing a moderate transition. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a massive pipeline of 383 units from large holiday orders. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders as this pipeline arrives and the forecast stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge (P42-P46) averaged 85 units. Expecting significant seasonal drop-off starting Period 48 (Jan) as shopping behavior returns to baseline.
