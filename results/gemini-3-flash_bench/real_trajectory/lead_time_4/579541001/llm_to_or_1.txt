Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for product 579541001 (Women's Cardigan) shows a stable mean of approximately 101.8 units (samples: 110, 107, 94, 107, 94). Given it is mid-February, we are still in the winter/spring transition where cardigans remain seasonally relevant. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' methods which calculate demand statistics based on all available historical samples to initialize the inventory position.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's cardigan. Looking at the historical demand samples (roughly 100 units/week) and the first game period (99 units), the demand is remarkably stable. The SKU started with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 1 ended with 0 inventory because the order placed in Period 1 (116 units) has a lead time of 4 periods and won't arrive until Period 5. This means we will face stockouts until that shipment arrives unless lead times are shorter than promised. I will use the recent demand samples (N=5 from history + P1) to set the forecast. L is set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=6 to capture the stable demand regime observed so far.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (pre-game: 110, 107, 94, 107, 94; Period 1: 99; Period 2: 140) suggests an average demand of approximately 107. The jump to 140 in Period 2 may indicate the start of a spring seasonal uptick for knitwear. Inventory is currently critical: zero on-hand and 230 in-transit. Promised lead time is 4. Following the lead-time logic, the order placed in Period 1 (116 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 Arrival Resolution, visible in Period 6 START. The order placed in Period 2 (114 units) is expected in Period 6 Arrival Resolution, visible in Period 7 START. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (P2: 140, P1: 99, Pre-P5: 94) to capture the recent mean of ~111, which accounts for the recent spike while remaining grounded. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the volatility from both the stable pre-game period and the recent surge (std \u2248 16.5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is a women's cardigan. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~102 units, but actual demand in the first three weeks of the game (Late Feb) has increased significantly: 99, 140, 137 (Average 125). This aligns with a transition into spring fashion. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet, which is expected as the first delivery (P1) is scheduled for Period 5 conclusion (visible P6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 370 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher demand regime observed in the game history (avg 125) relative to the initial data (avg 102). Setting L to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to challenge the promised lead time of 4. mu_hat will be based on the last 3 periods to account for the ~20% uptick in demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU '579541001' is a women's cardigan. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, according to the timing rules, it should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (L=4 means Period 1 order arrives in Period 1+4=5). Therefore, it is normal that we have seen 0 units arrive in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4. Because on-hand inventory has been 0, all demand to date (totaling 465 units) has resulted in lost sales. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 533 units (sum of orders from P1-P4: 116+114+140+163). Historical demand samples (110, 107, 94, 107, 94) show a mean of ~102. Recent demand in the game history (99, 140, 137, 89) is slightly more volatile but averages around 116. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 captures this recent game behavior. For L, I will use 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=4 covers the actual game demand periods observed so far.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's fine-knit cardigan, which typically sees stable demand in early spring. Based on history, the first order (Period 1) arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (arrived in P5 resolve). This confirms L=4. Current on-hand is 24, with 515 units in-transit. Demand history shows values: 99, 140, 137, 89, 92. The mean of these 5 samples is 111.4. There was a slight peak in Late Feb (P2/P3), but demand has settled around 90 units in the last two weeks. Given the transition into late March, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the overall average demand while weighting the recent stabilization. Sigma is set to default to handle the observed variance (std \u2248 24.3).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demand for the 'Calista cardigan' shows relative stability with a mean of 110 units (including pre-game samples). The recent demand in Periods 5 and 6 (92 and 102 units) suggests a slight dip below the early-period highs, but no sustained regime shift is confirmed yet. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1 and 2 arriving in Periods 5 and 6 respectively. This matches the promised lead time. Inventory management is now critical as on-hand inventory (36) is low relative to weekly demand (~105), but a large pipeline (454 units) exists from previous orders (Periods 3, 4, 5, 6). The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering if base stock is set correctly. I will use the default lead time (4) and calculation for mean/sigma based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand level while ignoring the initial spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Observed demand has shown a significant increase in the most recent period (P7: 173), contrasting with the previous 6 periods (P1-P6 mean: ~110). This aligns with a potential seasonal spring uplift for women's cardigans. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1, P2, P3 orders all arrived with L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), and logically the P4 order (163 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P8 resolution) according to the L=4 logic. Since we use (L+1) for mu_hat, and looking at the recent demand spike, I will set mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime. mu_hat = (4+1) * 135 (weighted average of recent samples) = 675. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the increased volatility noticed in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Demand increased from avg ~110 to 173 (+57%) coinciding with spring seasonality for knitwear.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical analysis shows a clear demand shift starting in Period 7 (March 25th). The 'Calista cardigan' is experiencing a seasonal surge as we enter spring. Demand in the last two periods was 173 and 195 (avg 184), significantly higher than the initial average of ~110. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because Period 8 demand (195) exceeded starting inventory (166). Units arriving in Period 9 (from order P5, 98 units) will likely be insufficient to meet the current demand trend (approx 185-200 units), so we must rely on the OR engine's base-stock calculation to bridge the gap. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=2) to capture the high spring demand regime (173 & 195). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=2) to account for the increased volatility in this peak period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely due to spring seasonality. The average demand from Period 7 to 9 is approximately 173.3 units, compared to the pre-regime average of ~110. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the last 2 periods resulted in stockouts (selling all arrived units but leaving demand unsatisfied: 195 units demand vs 166 sold in P8; 152 demand vs 98 sold in P9). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have shifted into a higher demand regime (avg ~173), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (Period 7-9) to capture this new mean (173.3 * 5 = 866.5). I will use the last 5 samples for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility during this transition while capping the lead time L at the default (promised) value of 4, which matches the concluded history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The demand for the 'Calista cardigan' shifted significantly at Period 7, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~165 over the last four periods (173, 195, 152, 142). This shift aligns with spring seasonality for light knitwear. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 8, 9, and 10 because the supply (based on orders placed before the demand shift) was insufficient. The in-transit pipeline (765 units) includes the larger orders placed from Period 7 onwards. To capture the current higher demand level while accounting for the recent variance, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (since the regime shift) and using the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 7-10 average is 165.5, confirming the ~50% increase from the early period average (~110).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are in a high-demand spring regime for the Calista knitwear cardigan. Demand since Period 7 has averaged 167.6 units/period (P7:173, P8:195, P9:152, P10:142, P11:176), significantly higher than the initial average of ~110. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in the last four periods (P8-P11), with total demand frequently outstripping arrivals. The pipeline (In-transit: 755) includes orders from P8 (191), P9 (210), P10 (247), and P11 (107). The P8 order (191 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 12 resolution) based on the 4-period lead time. To stabilize service levels and account for the sustained higher demand mean (~168) and variability (std ~21) in this regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the post-P7 shift. This sets a base stock target that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1) to minimize further lost sales while balancing holding costs once the pipeline starts arriving.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are managing the 'Calista cardigan'. Historical lead times consistently align with the promised 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12). Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift that occurred around Period 7, coinciding with spring seasonality for knitwear. The average demand since Period 7 (Periods 7-12) is 170.8 units per period, compared to the early-season average of ~110. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 187, slightly above the regime average. Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) following a stockout period, though a large pipeline (687 units) is in transit. To account for the sustained higher demand regime and the volatility observed (std dev ~22 since the shift), I am using N=6 for both mean and sigma calculation to capture the post-shift performance. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is a fine-knit cardigan, which has shown a sustained demand increase since Period 7 (late March), aligning with spring seasonality. Between Periods 7 and 13, the average demand has been approximately 174.7 units per period, compared to the early period average of roughly 110. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. Since Period 7, we have experienced several stockouts, indicating that the OR backend needs to account for this higher demand regime. To ensure sufficient stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods), I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (Periods 7-13) to capture this new stable mean and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect higher volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period timing is well-established in the conclusion messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 7-13 average is 174.7 units, representing a 59% increase over the initial average (Periods 1-6 avg: 110), driven by spring seasonality for knitwear.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is in a stabilized high-demand regime driven by spring seasonality. Since Period 7, the average weekly demand has been approximately 174.7 units. The most recent demand (Period 14) was 175 units, consistent with this regime. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple historical arrivals (Periods 5 through 14 all showed lead_time=4). For Period 15, on-hand inventory is 88 units and in-transit inventory is 642 units (orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of the high-demand regime (last 8 periods, from Period 7 to 14), we set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=8. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the volatility of this specific regime. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal peak while accounting for the high in-transit volume to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Calista cardigan) is in a stable high-demand regime that began around Period 7 (March 25), coinciding with spring seasonality. The average demand since Period 7 is approximately 177.3 units per period (Periods 7-15), compared to ~110 units in the early periods. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly lower (175, 198, 153), but still aligns with the post-Period 7 shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 42 and several large orders in-transit (P12-P15), the focus is on maintaining a sufficient base stock for the L+1 window (5 periods). The target base stock for the OR engine is roughly (1+4) * 177 = 885 units. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 captures the entirety of the current high-demand regime starting from Period 7. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher volume.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift started around Period 7 (late March), as demand for this fine-knit cardigan increased by approximately 50-60%. Since Period 7, demand has averaged 171.4 units (P7-P16), compared to the earlier average of ~110. Recent demand (last 4 periods) is 173.75, showing high consistency. In-transit arrivals have been stable with a consistent lead time of 4 periods (as seen in every conclude message from P5 to P16). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 16, though 734 units are in transit. To capture the current seasonal demand level and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lead time (L=4), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to cover the post-shift regime starting at Period 7. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the perfectly observed 4-period lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a fine-knit viscose blend cardigan, typically a spring/transitional item. Demand has cooled slightly from the late April/early May peak (avg ~180-190) down to an average of 147.7 units over the last 3 periods (P15-P17). This indicates the start of a summer demand deceleration. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (P1 to P13 orders). Currently, on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 694. I will set L to 'calculate' as it consistently returns 4. For demand mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 11-17) to capture this recent cooling trend (avg ~160.6) compared to the higher peak earlier in the spring, which ensures the OR backend doesn't over-order as we move into summer. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected: Period 15-17 average demand dropped to 147.7 units from a previous peak of ~180-190, likely due to summer seasonality for viscose-knitwear.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fine-knit viscose cardigan. Current data confirms a seasonal demand decline as we enter summer (late June). Demand for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) has trended: 153, 169, 121, 106, averaging approximately 137 units per week. This is a significant drop from the spring peak average of ~175 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=4) to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs. I use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to capture the recent volatility correctly. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat will calculate (1+L) * mean(recent 4 samples), which is 5 * 137.25 = 686.25, better aligning with current consumption than the all-history average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand moved from spring peak (~175) to a summer deceleration phase starting around P17, with the P17-P18 average dropping to 113.5 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late June (2019/6/24). The product is a fine-knit viscose-blend cardigan, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as summer progresses. Demand has dropped from a spring peak of ~175 units to a recent average of ~112 units (Periods 17-19: 121, 106, 108). Period 19 had 0 order units, which was a correct adjustment to prevent overstocking during this deceleration phase. The on-hand inventory is currently high (258 units), and there is a significant pipeline in-transit (418 units). Specifically, orders from P16 (141), P17 (162), and P18 (115) are scheduled to arrive in Periods 20, 21, and 22 respectively. Given the current demand rate of ~110 units and the lead time (L=4), we expect to sell roughly 550 units over the next 5 periods. With total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) at 676 units, we are already over-covered for the lead-time horizon. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average to reflect the lower summer demand regime, ensuring the OR backend caps further ordering while we bleed off the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at summer low: Period 17-19 average is 111.7 units, down from the spring peak of ~175 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fine-knit viscose blend cardigan (579541001), currently experiencing a seasonal demand drop as we enter the summer months (July). Demand peaked in mid-spring (Periods 7-14) at ~175 units and has since stabilized at a lower summer regime. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P17-P20) is 112.75 units (121, 106, 108, 116). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 283 units on-hand and 277 in-transit (orders from P17-P18 expected to arrive in P21-P22), the total pipeline inventory is 560 units. This is significantly above the required base stock for the current demand regime (~113 * 5 = 565 units, but we already have ample stock given the holding cost). I will use recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized summer demand of ~113 units per week. The OR backend will likely recommend ordering 0 units due to the high on-hand and in-transit inventory relative to the lower summer demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (cardigan) has entered a summer demand regime following its spring peak. Current inventory analysis: On-hand is 294 units, and In-transit is 132 units (orders from P18: 115, P21: 17). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the spring peak. Recent demands: P17: 121, P18: 106, P19: 108, P20: 116, P21: 151. While P21 showed a slight uptick, the overall trend since P17 represents the summer deceleration mentioned in carry-over insights. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 120.4 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for the current 120.4/week average across the lead time + review period (5 weeks), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5). This captures the current summer stabilization better than a long-term average, accounting for the slight increase in P21 while acknowledging it's lower than the spring high.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand regime stabilized in summer range (P17-P21 avg: 120.4 units), confirming a shift away from the spring peak (~175 units) to a moderate summer volume.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Womens Knitwear Cardigan) has transitioned from its spring peak (avg ~175) to a more moderate summer demand regime. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 126 units (P17-P22). Specifically, the last two periods (P21: 151, P22: 155) show a slight uptick compared to the mid-summer lows (P19: 108, P20: 116), suggesting a stabilization around the 130-150 range. On-hand inventory is currently high (254 units) due to deliveries from the earlier peak-demand ordering phase. In-transit inventory consists of orders from P21 (17 units) and P22 (151 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To manage the current surplus while ensuring service levels for the stabilized demand, I will use a recent_N window of 6 (P17-P22) to capture the summer regime shift. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a mean demand of ~126 units per period across the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P17-P22): Average demand has stabilized at ~126 units, down from the spring peak of ~175 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (viscose-knit cardigan) is currently in a summer demand regime. While previous periods suggested a significant drop to around 120 units, recent data from P21-P23 (151, 155, 173) indicates an upward trend or late-summer volatility, averaging 159.7 units over these three weeks. The 'arrived=0' in Period 23 is expected because the order from Period 19 was 0; the next arrival (P24) follows the Period 20 order of 0. On-hand inventory is at 81 units, which is low given the recent demand spike. Pipeline inventory (330) consists of orders from P21 (17), P22 (151), and P23 (162). To avoid stockouts while managing the moderate summer holding cost, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent three-week upward shift (avg ~160) rather than the deeper summer low observed in June. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility detected in July (P21-P23): average demand increased to 159.7 units from the June summer low of ~112 units, suggesting a potential mid-summer rally or higher baseline than previously estimated.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (viscose cardigan) is currently experiencing high demand volatility. After a significant drop in June (Period 17-20), demand spiked back up in July (Periods 21-23 averaged 159.7) before a sharp dip in Period 24 (119). However, Period 24 demand was likely constrained by starting on-hand inventory (81 units), as the stockout suggests true demand was higher. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, but orders from Period 19 and 20 (which were 0 units) have resulted in 0 arrivals in Periods 23 and 24, leading to the current stockout (on-hand: 0). We are waiting for arrivals from Period 21 (17 units) and Period 22 (151 units). Because we are entering late July/early August, we anticipate a transition from summer lows toward early autumn demand. Given the stockout and recent volatility, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the July rally (Mean: 149.8) while protecting against the stockout.mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 150 = 750. sigma_hat is set using the last 8 periods to capture the recent volatility seen throughout July.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in July: Periods 21-23 averaged 159.7 units, significantly higher than the June average of ~112. However, Period 24 saw a stockout-restricted demand of 119.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Women's Cardigan) is experiencing significant supply chain issues and high demand volatility. We are currently in early August (Period 26), which typically sees the start of late-summer/early-autumn demand. Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged 149 units, but significant stockouts in P24 and P25 due to delayed arrivals have suppressed 'sold' units. The order from Period 19 (placed June 17, likely significant given the pipeline history) and Period 20 (placed June 24) are now overdue (P19 should have arrived in P23, P20 in P24), and are likely 'lost' per the environment rules. Arrival for P21 was 4 periods as expected. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher late-July baseline (avg ~150) before potential autumn increases. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average valid historical arrivals, but the manual override via a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat will help account for the lost stock and the risk of further delays.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment alert: P19 and P20 orders did not arrive within the expected 4-period window and are missing as of P26. Demand regime has stabilized higher in July/August (P21-P25 avg ~150) compared to the June low (~112).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (women's cardigan) is experiencing a period of high demand volatility and significant inventory disruption. Demand has shifted from a June low (~112) back to a higher late-summer regime (Period 21-26 average is ~150 units). Current inventory is 0 on-hand following two periods of stockouts (P25 and P26), where actual demand likely exceeded sales. A major supply crisis is evident: orders from Period 19 (0 units) and Period 20 (0 units) had no physical impact on pipeline, but more critically, the order from Period 23 (162 units) arrived during Period 27 (visible next period) but didn't help Period 26. The order from Period 24 (204 units) is expected next. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 5 periods to account for the consistent stockout gap and slight arrival friction. Demand mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the late-summer stabilization around 150 units, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level to recover from the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Disruption: Period 19 and 20 orders (though 0 units) and the delay/stockout in P23-25 confirm that the 4-period lead time window is insufficient to prevent stockouts during demand rallies. Late summer demand (Aug) has stabilized at ~150 units, significantly higher than the June trough.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan has stabilized in a high-summer range. Excluding periods with stockouts, demand since Period 21 has averaged approximately 152 units (P21: 151, P22: 155, P23: 173, P26: 156, P27: 134). While the P19 and P20 orders (0 units each) did not result in arrivals, the supply chain recovered starting in P25 with the P21 order. The observed lead time for recent arrivals (P21->P25, P22->P26, P23->P27) remains 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units, and there are 649 units in transit (P24: 204, P25: 184, P26: 81, P27: 180). Because the pipeline is now well-populated but demand remains strong, I am using recent_N=7 for demand (covering the period since P21) to capture the higher baseline while acknowledging the slight dip in P27. This balances the risk of stockouts during the transition to late-summer/early-fall demand.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (P21-P27) stabilized at an average of ~152 units, excluding stockout restricted periods (P24, P25). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite the mid-summer replenishment gap caused by zero-unit orders in P19-P20.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand has stabilized in a 'late summer' regime following the July rally. Looking at recent unconstrained demand (excluding stockout periods P24-P26), demand in P21-P23 averaged 159.7 and P27-P28 demand was 134 and 92. The P28 drop to 92 suggests a transition out of the late summer peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P21-P28), which encompasses the July/August higher demand and the recent end-of-summer softening, providing a balanced forecast of (~135-140 units per week). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same 8-period window to capture the increased volatility seen during this transition. I am maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods as shipments from P21-P24 have arrived exactly as expected.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand transition: Demand dropped to 92 in P28 from a higher July/August baseline (~150), suggesting the end of the summer peak for the viscose-knit cardigan.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant drop over the last two periods (P28: 92, P29: 120) compared to the July/August average of ~150. This aligns with the transition from late summer to autumn where demand for light viscose cardigans typically decelerates before potential end-of-season shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P25 order arrived in P29). On-hand inventory is healthy at 204 units with 429 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N strategy (N=4) for demand to capture the current downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for fluctuations, as the last few periods show a return to a lower baseline similar to the June trough (~112-120).

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed for late August/early September: P28-P29 average demand is 106 units, down ~30% from the July/August peak (~152).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1070.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is entering early September (2019-09-09). The latest observation (Period 30) showed a significant demand spike to 271 units, contradicting the 'late August deceleration' hypothesis (Period 28-29 average was 106). This spike likely represents a 'Back to School' or early Autumn transition for knitwear. With on-hand inventory low (14 units) and lead time stable at 4 periods, I must adjust the forecast to account for this potential new high-demand regime. Using recent_N (N=4) captures the volatility and the recent spike (Avg P27-P30: 154.25) more effectively than a long-term average, while staying responsive to the most current signal. Lead time (L) remains 4 based on confirmed arrivals from Periods 21-26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 30: Sudden spike to 271 units suggests an early Autumn/Back-to-School demand surge for knitwear, reversing the late August deceleration.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the SKU '579541001' is experiencing a significant Autumn/Back-to-School demand surge. Period 30 demand was 271 and Period 31 demand was 240 (partially restricted by stockout), indicating a new regime averaging approximately 255 units, which is a ~70% increase over the late-summer baseline (~150). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (499 units) consists of orders from P28 (95 units), P29 (73 units), P30 (45 units), and P31 (286 units). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P28 order is due to arrive this period (P32), but it is small (95 units). To capture this high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1275, calculated as (1 + Lead Time of 4) * 255. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility of this transition. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as the 4-period window is stable despite the P19/P20 missing orders (which were actually zero-unit orders).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed at Period 31: Average demand increased to ~255 units (+70% from late summer baseline) driven by seasonal knitwear trends.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn knitwear peak (September). Demand spiked in Period 30 (271) and remained high but restricted by stockouts in Periods 31 (demand 240) and 32 (demand 227). The current average demand for this autumn regime is approximately 246 units (mean of P30-P32). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (orders from P27 and P28 arrived exactly 4 periods later). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 791 units in-transit (P29: 73, P30: 45, P31: 286, P32: 387). To ensure availability during this high-demand period and recover from stockouts, I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent autumn average (~246 per period) for the (L+1) horizon (5 * 246 = 1230) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the transition from summer to autumn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed starting Period 30: average demand increased to ~246 units (+60% from late summer baseline) driven by seasonal knitwear trends.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is experiencing a strong Autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 363 units, significantly higher than the previous Autumn regime average (~246). We have been stocked out for three consecutive periods (P31-P33), meaning historical demand in those periods was supply-constrained (sold < demand). To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a recent_N method focusing on the last 4 periods (P30-P33) to capture this higher volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that accounts for this high-velocity demand (~275 units/period) plus the 4-period lead time, while acknowledging that current in-transit inventory (1094 units) will begin arriving to relieve the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified: Late September (P33) demand hit 363 units, pushing the recent regime average (P30-P33) to 275 units, significantly higher than the initial autumn estimate of 246.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School regime for this viscose-blend cardigan. Demand in the most recent five periods (P30-P34) has been 271, 240, 227, 363, and 265, averaging approximately 273.2 units per period. The significant stockouts in P31-P34 (on-hand 0 at decision time) indicate that previous orders were insufficient to cover this seasonal surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the spring peak previously reached ~175 and we are now well above that (averaging ~273, with a peak of 363), I will focus on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new elevated baseline and its high volatility. This ensures the base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is calculated using the current regime's higher mean and variance, preventing further stockouts during what appears to be the peak of the knitwear season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P34) average demand is 273.2 units, representing a significant +80% increase over the late summer baseline (~152) and surpassing the previous spring peak (~175).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Autumn demand peak (October), which is a high-volume period for knitwear. Recent demand samples show a significant regime shift starting at Period 30: 271, 240, 227, 363, 265, 254. The average demand for this period (P30-P35) is approximately 270 units, a major increase from the summer baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P31 order arrived in P35). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this Autumn peak, and recently high volatility (sigma_hat) using the same window (N=6). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current 270 unit/period demand across the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak for knitwear confirmed (P30-P35): average demand has stabilized at ~270 units, significantly outperforming previous spring and summer peaks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its autumn peak season. Since Period 30, demand has shifted significantly upward, with the average demand from P30 to P36 being approximately 265 units. Period 33 specifically saw a massive spike to 363 units. Although the last two periods (P35-P36) show slight stabilization around 235-254 units, the overall regime is much higher than previous seasons. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent_N method (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand autumn regime (starting from Period 30). This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~265 unit weekly average plus the associated volatility, preventing stockouts during this high-volume period while acknowledging that the very highest peaks (P33) might be outliers or the theoretical maximum of the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak for knitwear (P30-P36): average demand has stabilized at ~265 units, significantly higher than previous seasonal peaks and requiring high inventory levels to service.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (viscose-knit cardigan) is currently in its peak Autumn demand regime, although demand has slightly decelerated from the extreme highs of late September (363 units) to a steadier average of approximately 235 units over the last three weeks (P34-P36). The current on-hand inventory is 339 units, with 852 units in-transit. A large shipment of 377 units (ordered in P34) is expected to arrive this period (P38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent Autumn regime (N=8, covering P30-P37) to ensure base stock levels are sufficient to handle the sustained elevated demand while acknowledging the recent stabilization around the 235-240 mark. This period's decision aims to maintain a high service level for the remainder of the peak season while preventing excessive overstocking as we approach the year-end transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak stabilization: Demand for P35-P37 has averaged 236.7 units, showing a slight cooling from the initial Autumn surge (P30-P34 avg of 273) but remaining significantly higher than summer levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in the midst of its peak autumn season (Periods 30-38). After an initial surge where demand peaked at 363 units (P33), the volume has stabilized. The last four periods (P35-P38) show demand of 254, 235, 221, and 259, averaging 242.25 units. While this is slightly lower than the P30-P34 average of ~273, it remains a robust high-demand regime. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of orders from P31-P34). Inventory levels have finally recovered from previous stockouts, with 457 units on hand and 667 in transit (from orders in P35-P38). To maintain service levels during this high-volume period while acknowledging the slight cooling from the extreme peak, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (P30-P38) to capture the full autumn regime average (~260 units per period), and recent_N for sigma to account for higher volatility observed during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P30-38) average has stabilized at approximately 260 units/period, significantly higher than all previous seasons but showing slight deceleration from the mid-September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan is entering a late autumn/early winter phase. Period 39 (early November) saw a significant drop in demand to 147 units, down from the Autumn average of ~260 units (P30-P38). This suggests a deceleration as the peak autumn knitwear season concludes. Currently, there is 351 units on-hand and 880 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory is high because of large orders placed during the peak (P31-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the evidence of deceleration, I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to use recent demand (recent_N=5) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough buffer. I will use a larger N for sigma (recent_N=10) to account for the high volatility seen during the autumn surge, ensuring the service level is maintained if demand fluctuates.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in early November: Period 39 demand dropped to 147 units from an Autumn average of ~260 units (-43%), signaling a seasonal shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), observing a clear seasonal downturn for the 'Calista cardigan'. Demand has dropped significantly from the Autumn peak of ~260 to an average of 159 across the last two periods (P39: 147, P40: 171). With winter approaching, this knitwear item is transitioning out of its primary high-demand window. Inventory is currently high with 408 units on-hand and 652 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the Autumn peak in P37-P39). Total supply (1,060) is far in excess of the revised demand forecast (approx. 5 periods * 160 units = 800). To avoid excessive holding costs on a decelerating product, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture the new lower demand level immediately. L remains at the stable 4-period default. sigma_hat is calculated from the recent regime to reflect the volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in early November: Autumn peak (~260) has ended, with P39-P40 demand averaging 159 units (-39%).

After a sustained autumn peak (Periods 30-38) averaging ~260-270 units, the last three periods (P39-P41) show a clear deceleration: 147, 171, and 120 units respectively, averaging 146 units per period. This shift represents a ~44% drop from the autumn peak, likely moving into a quieter late-autumn or pre-holiday retail window. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 494 units), which is more than enough to cover 3-4 periods of demand at the new lower rate. Pipeline inventory (446 units) is also substantial. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the downward demand trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the new lower demand regime (avg ~146) while avoiding excessive ordering that would incur holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late November: The autumn knitwear peak has concluded. Periods 39-41 average demand is 146 units, down from the ~260 unit autumn baseline (-44%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) has entered a post-autumn deceleration phase. Current date is Dec 2 (Period 43). After a heavy Autumn peak averaging ~260 units (P30-P38), demand has dropped significantly. Over the last four periods (P39-P42), demand has been 147, 171, 120, and 120, resulting in a recent mean of 139.5 units. With 566 units on hand and 254 in transit (total 820), and a projected demand of ~140, the current inventory covers nearly 6 periods, which is more than the (L+1)=5 window. However, looking at late November demand (P41-P42 both at 120), we should look for potential stabilization or further holiday shifts. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this post-peak regime (avg ~140) and sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the autumn surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is high enough that the OR backend will likely zero out orders to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime stabilized: Periods 39-42 average demand is 139.5 units, a 46% decrease from the autumn peak (~260). Late November demand (P41-P42) specifically settled at 120 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan has continued to decelerate significantly as we enter December. Period 43 demand was 69 units, down from the already reduced average of ~139 observed in Periods 39-42. The current on-hand inventory is 751 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current decelerating demand trend (P39-P43 avg: 125 units), 751 units covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (751 / 125 \u2248 6). Since the game is nearing its end (Period 44 of 47) and on-hand inventory alone exceeds the expected demand for the remaining periods (44, 45, 46, 47), the goal is to avoid further ordering to minimize holding costs. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the deceleration, and set the lead time to its observed consistent value of 4 periods. The OR backend will see that on-hand + pipeline (751 + 0) far exceeds the base stock calculated from these parameters, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: December demand deceleration confirmed: Period 43 demand dropped to 69 units, bringing the P39-P43 average to 125.4 units (a 52% decrease from the autumn peak of ~260).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 45 (2019/12/16). We are in the final stages of the game (total 47 periods). The 'Calista cardigan' has entered a clear late-season/winter deceleration. Demand over the last six periods (P39-P44) has been: 147, 171, 120, 120, 69, 105, averaging 122 units. The most recent three periods (P42-P44) average even lower at 98 units, signaling a continued drop as we approach year-end. We currently have 646 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the end of the game (P47). Therefore, the primary objective is to liquidate the existing high on-hand inventory (646 units) to avoid significant holding costs ($1.0/unit) while satisfying the remaining demand. Our current inventory covers approximately 6+ periods of demand at the current rate (646 / 98 \u2248 6.6), which is more than enough for the 3 remaining periods (P45, P46, P47). I will set mu_hat using the recent N=6 samples to reflect the downward trend, and lead time L to default (4). The backend will logically stop ordering because base_stock will be significantly lower than the current inventory level.

Carry-over insight: December demand deceleration confirmed: Periods 42-44 average demand has fallen to 98 units, representing a 62% decrease from the autumn peak (~260).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for this viscose-knit cardigan has significantly decelerated following the autumn peak (~260 units). Over the last five periods (P41-P45), demand has averaged 110 units, with the most recent three periods (P43-P45) averaging 103 units. The autumn stock surplus is slowly being cleared, with 510 units still on-hand. Given that the promised lead time remains 4 periods, we are currently holding sufficient stock to cover roughly 4-5 weeks of current demand. However, historical data from January 2019 (107-110 units) suggests that demand might stabilize around this level rather than continuing to plummet to zero. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average ~110) to reflect this new late-winter/post-peak baseline and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4 weeks) as recent arrivals have been consistent with the promised timeframe.

Carry-over insight: December/January demand regime shift: Post-autumn peak demand has stabilized at a lower baseline (P41-P45 avg: 110 units), significantly down from the ~260 unit autumn peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, indicating the end-of-year holiday/winter period for the Calista cardigan. Demand has significantly cooled from the autumn peak (~260 units) and stabilized at a much lower winter baseline. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 41-46) is approximately 110 units (120, 120, 69, 105, 136, 109). On-hand inventory is high at 401 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 4 periods of current demand. Pipeline inventory (88 units) includes orders from Periods 45 and 46. Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we are well-stocked for the immediate future. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels for this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent average of ~110 units and using recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: Periods 41-46 average demand has settled at 109.8 units, confirming a sustained lower baseline following the autumn peak and early December dip.
