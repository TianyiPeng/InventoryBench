In many regions, mid-February is late winter/early spring transition, typically a steady or slightly decreasing season for light knitwear. Historical Data: Demand over the last 5 weeks has been relatively stable: 110, 107, 94, 107, 94. The average is ~102 units/period. Lead Time Calculation: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With a 1-period observation delay, an order placed in P1 arrives in P5 and is visible in the P6 START message. Therefore, this order must cover demand for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 periods). Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. Total pipeline = 0. Forecast: Assuming a stable demand regime of ~102 units/period, total demand for the next 5 periods is 510 units. Final Order Logic: To establish a base inventory and cover the lead time pipeline, I will order 510 units. This is a conservative target given the holding costs ($1) vs profit ($4) ratio, aiming to avoid stockouts while establishing the first pipeline flow.",

Period 1 actual demand was 99, which is consistent with this regime. We are currently in mid-February; demand for light knitwear typically remains stable or slightly increases as we transition into early spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since an order of 510 units was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). We are currently in Period 2. Pipeline Analysis: On-hand (0) + In-transit (510). I need to cover demand until Period 6 (Current Period 2 + 4 periods lead time). Estimated demand for P2-P6 (5 periods) is 102 * 5 = 510 units. The pipeline reflects exactly 510 units. However, to account for safety stock and the fact that the first order won't arrive until Period 5 (meaning we will experience lost sales in Periods 2, 3, and 4), I need to ensure a continuous flow. Ordering another batch now to cover the next interval. Target inventory level for a 5-period window (L+1) is ~510-550. I will order 110 units to maintain the pipeline for the subsequent period (P7).",

As of Period 5 (March 11), we are entering the peak spring season where demand for light cardigans typically remains steady or increases.

Historically, autumn demand for this item peaked in September/October (averaging ~270 units/week). Data from the last two periods (P39: 147 units, P40: 171 units) confirms a significant downward trend as the peak knitwear season concludes and consumers likely shift toward heavier winter wear or wait for holiday sales. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 1,523 units, plus 400 units in-transit (ordered in P38-P39), totaling a pipeline of 1,923 units. Given the game ends at Period 47, we have 7 periods remaining. Even at a conservative demand estimate of 150-170 units/week, we have over 11 weeks of supply. Therefore, adding more inventory would only increase holding costs without generating additional sales before the game concludes. No further orders are needed.",

My current on-hand inventory alone (1,403) significantly exceeds the total remaining demand, and I am already incurring a holding cost of $1.0/unit.

Demand in the last two periods has stabilized at 120 units, down from the 240-270 range seen during the peak. We are currently at Period 43 out of 47. There are only 5 periods of demand remaining (P43, P44, P45, P46, P47). At the current demand rate of ~120 units/week, the total remaining demand is approximately 600 units (120 * 5). Our Current On-Hand inventory is 1,483 units, which already covers more than double the projected remaining demand. Additionally, 200 units (ordered in P39) are still in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 44. Since our total pipeline (1,683 units) vastly exceeds any possible remaining demand before the game ends, and the holding cost is $1.0/unit while profit is $4.0/unit, any further ordering would only decrease the total reward by increasing unnecessary holding costs and ending inventory penalties.
