Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt', a basic apparel item. Looking at the 5 historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand spiked significantly in the most recent week (41 units vs. previous average of ~16). This suggests an early spring uptick or a promotional driver as we move deeper into February. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand and in-transit are zero. The promised lead time is 4. To ensure sufficient coverage for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and accounting for the recent demand jump, I will use recent_N to prioritize the most recent data points while maintaining a conservative buffer for the SKU's high service level requirement (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1). N=5 captures the available history but allows the OR engine to react to the recent mean and variance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic T-shirt. Observed demand in P1 was 60, significantly higher than previous history (mean of 21.4). With a promised lead time of 4, the initial order of 41 units placed in P1 is in-transit and not expected until P5. We currently have 0 on-hand and 41 in-transit. P1 demand (60) combined with the most recent sample (41) suggests a shift in demand regime compared to the early January samples (avg ~16). Calculating recent_N (N=2) for demand mean: (41+60)/2 = 50.5. Given the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. L is set to default (4). mu_hat is set using recent_N=2 to capture the recent jump in demand while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=2 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing a Fitted T-shirt. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 60 and 77 respectively, which is significantly higher than the initial historical data (avg ~21). This suggests a strong upward regime shift as we enter spring. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected at P5). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. I need to capture the recent high demand to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the (L+1) period window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat based on the observed demand in P1 and P2 (avg 68.5) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (Date: 2019/2/11). Demand increased from historical average of 21.4 to recent average of 68.5 (+220%) over 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a basic T-shirt. A significant demand regime shift was identified starting Period 1, likely due to spring seasonality or a change in product visibility. Historical demand (mean ~21) has jumped to an average of 78.3 units over the last 3 periods (60, 77, 98). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (41 units), P2 (77 units), and P3 (113 units) are all in-transit, totaling 231 units. The first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+L=5), meaning we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and are experiencing lost sales. To capture the recent demand surge and ensure the base stock covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the high-growth phase. Since no orders have concluded yet, L remains 'default' (4 weeks).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: 3-period average is 78.3, a substantial increase (+265%) from the initial historical mean of 21.4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a fitted T-shirt, and demand has shifted significantly upward since February (Period 1). The 4-period demand average since the shift is 81 units (60, 77, 98, 89), which is roughly 4x the prior historical average of 21.4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (41 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will only be visible in the Period 6 'conclude' message. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 341 units in transit (41+77+113+110). Given the sustained demand increase, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the new demand mean and volatility since the regime shift. Lead time (L) is kept at 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1 (2019/2/11): the average demand over the last 4 weeks is 81.0, vs the historical 21.4 (+278%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a fitted cotton T-shirt, which sees increasing demand approaching Spring/Summer. Historically, demand was low (avg ~21.4), but since Period 1, there has been a sustained regime shift. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 74.8 (60, 77, 98, 89, 50). Period 5 showed a dip to 50, but we remain in a high-demand phase compared to January. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, the Period 1 order arrived exactly after 4 periods, confirming L=4. Currently, on-hand is 0 because demand (50) exceeded the arrival (41). Pipeline inventory is 409 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given the regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand volatility since Period 1. L will be kept as default as the promised lead time holds.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a basic T-shirt. The historical data (Jan-early Feb) showed demand ~21/week, but since mid-February (Period 1), it surged to 81.0/week. Over the last 6 periods, demand has been: 60, 77, 98, 89, 50, 42. The average for these 6 periods is 69.3. There is a slight cooling trend in the last two weeks (50 and 42), possibly indicating the initial surge is stabilizing. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). For Period 7 decisions: (1) L: The promised lead time of 4 matches observations. I will use 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time data. (2) mu_hat: Using N=6 (the length of the new regime) to capture the higher baseline while respecting the recent moderation. Average of last 6 samples (~69.3) * (1+L=5) = 346.5. (3) sigma_hat: Using N=6 to capture the volatility of the current regime. Currently, we have 35 on-hand and 371 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), which is sufficient pipeline to cover the (L+1) horizon if demand stays near 69-70.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer demand has stabilized at a new, higher level since Period 1 (2019/02/11). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (excluding the low historical samples) is approximately 69.4 units per period. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3. In-transit inventory is currently 281 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), which aligns with the expected pipeline for a 4-period lead time. To ensure we provide the backend with the most relevant forecast, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the post-shift demand regime. This will set the base stock level to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the current higher volume and moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 (2019/02/11) is sustained: 7-period mean is 69.4 vs historical 21.4 (+224%). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (3 consecutive observations).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-08. The product is a fitted t-shirt, which typically sees steady demand as spring progresses. Historical demand data from early 2019 (pre-Period 1) averaged 21.4, but starting in Period 1 (late Feb), demand shifted significantly higher, averaging 69.4 over the last 8 periods. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized around 62.3. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods according to the last 4 arrivals. On-hand inventory is 113, with 234 units in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime that began at Period 1, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the sustained higher volume and the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $818.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a staple 'Fitted T-shirt' (Divided Basics), which saw a demand regime shift starting in mid-February (Period 1, 2019/02/11). The pre-regime average demand was approximately 21.4, while the average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 68.1. Recent demand has stabilized with a mean of 62.2 over the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (based on arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-5). For Period 10, the total pipeline (On-hand: 170 + In-transit: 199 = 369) is being evaluated against the target stock. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the inventory policy should target a high service level. However, demand has slightly cooled from its peak (average 81 in Period 5 down to 68 currently). I will use a recent_N window of 9 to capture the entirety of the new demand regime without including the significantly lower pre-regime data, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Fitted T-shirt) is in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (2019/02/11). Since that date, the mean demand over 10 periods is 67.7 units, significantly higher than the pre-period samples (avg 21.4). In the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10), the mean is 60.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (consistent across 6 observations). Current on-hand (145) plus in-transit (201) equals 346 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our forecast (mu_hat) will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to ensure sufficient safety stock for this staple item.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The SKU is a fitted T-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand during spring and summer months. Historically, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 1 (late February), where demand increased from ~21.4 units/week to an average of ~64.5 units/week over the last 11 periods. The last 3 weeks (Periods 9-11) have shown a slight stabilization or cooling compared to the initial peak, with demand at 52, 64, and 57 (average 57.7). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 7 consecutive observations (Periods 5 through 11). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since Period 1, while sigma_hat will also use N=11 to capture the volatility within this elevated period. On-hand + In-transit (111 + 236 = 347) appears sufficient to cover demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods (approx 320 units based on current mean), so the OR backend will likely order a maintenance quantity.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted t-shirt, which sees increasing demand as we move into the spring/summer season (May). Historical demand since Period 1 shows a new regime with a mean of approximately 68.75 units per week (Period 1-12 average). Recent demand in Period 12 (91 units) suggests a slight upward trend or seasonal peak approaching. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across 8 consecutive arrivals, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=12 to capture the full shift in demand regime while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for a (L+1) = 5 period horizon.mu_hat will be based on the last 12 periods, setting mu_hat = (1+4) * 68.75 \u2248 344. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=12 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt in soft cotton jersey', a basic item with sustained demand. Since the regime shift at Period 1 (2019/02/11), demand has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-period historical samples. The average demand from Period 1 to Period 13 is approximately 69.8 units per week. Recent demand (last 3-5 weeks) shows slightly higher volatility (reaching 91 in Period 12). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 13). On-hand inventory is 76, and in-transit is 247 (orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, 13). With a profit of $19/unit and a holding cost of $1/unit, the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean while smoothing recent fluctuations, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance observed in the new regime. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted T-shirt (Jersey Basic), which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand during the transition from Spring into Summer (May 20). Historical demand from the game periods (P1-P14) reveals a mean of 69.85 units, but more importantly, a sustained regime has developed since Period 1. The last 7 periods (P8-P14) show an average demand of 72.1 units with significant volatility (std dev ~15). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals). On-hand inventory is currently low (28), and although 296 units are in-transit, we must maintain the base stock to cover demand over L+1 (5) periods. I am choosing recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-shift behavior while smoothing out weekly fluctuations. This method allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the last 7 weeks of post-regime-shift data (P8-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (late Feb/Spring season). Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) averaged 84.2 units/week, showing a slight uptick from the previous 5-period average (63.0 units). With the current date of 2019/05/27, we are entering the peak summer season for cotton t-shirts, justifying a focus on recent high demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), though arrivals from Period 12 (expected during Period 16) should stabilize stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a 5-period average (covering roughly one lead time cycle) to smooth out weekly fluctuations and ensure high service levels during the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high regime (~84 units/week) observed since 2019/02/11, consistent with Spring/Summer seasonality for basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1007.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Fitted T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by Spring/Summer seasonality. Recent demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 88.4 units, which is higher than the long-term average since Period 1 (~73 units). Lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 16 (45 units lost). To recover the service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19), I am using L=4 and setting mu_hat based on the most recent 10-period demand window (which accounts for the 70-98 range) to capture the higher baseline while minimizing overstock risk. Sigma_hat is also set using the most recent 10 periods to reflect current volatility. The target service level (q) is 95% based on the cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high regime (approx. 85-90 units/week) consistent with peak Summer seasonality; lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on 12 consecutive observations.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is a jersey t-shirt, currently in its peak summer demand period. Demand has been consistently high since Period 1 (~84 units/week), with the last few periods showing slightly higher volatility (98 in P16, 67 in P17). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. Since we are in a high-demand regime that significantly differs from the initial history, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting. For mu_hat, N=17 is used to capture the entire summer regime shift since Period 1. For sigma_hat, N=6 is used to capture the recent increase in volatility (range of 52 to 98) to ensure the buffer is sufficient against stockouts during this high-margin season (Profit: $19, Holding: $1).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, representing peak summer demand for 'T-shirt | Divided Basics'. Demand has remained high since February, with a more recent 5-period average (P14-P18) of 81 units per week, aligning with the observed summer regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across 14 consecutive deliveries (P5 through P18). Current on-hand inventory is 53 units, and the pipeline contains 284 units (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18), which are scheduled to arrive in P19, P20, P21, and P22 respectively (97, 103, 48, 36 units). To maintain optimal service levels given high lead time (L=4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand (capturing the entire high-regime period from P1 onwards) and 'calculate' for lead time to use the stabilized history. This approach ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, reflects the current high-utility summer season while accounting for the high ratio of profit ($19) to holding cost ($1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is the peak summer season for cotton t-shirts ('Divided Basics'). Demand has remained high and stable. Analyzing the demand from Period 1 to the present (the 'high' regime), the average demand is approximately 74.3 units per week, with recent demand specifically hovering around 80 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods based on 15 consecutive arrivals. Carry-over insights suggest a regime shift occurred at Period 1 and has sustained. To maximize the reward (Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the high regime since Period 1) to capture this elevated demand while maintaining safety stock. The OR backend uses a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which is appropriate for a high-margin, low-holding-cost basic item. In-transit inventory (276) plus on-hand (63) is 339, which covers roughly 4.6 periods of demand at the current rate, aligning with a lead time of 4 plus review time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted T-shirt (Divided Basics), which is in peak demand during the current summer period (July 1st). Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 87.8 units/week, with the most recent observation reaching a peak of 119. This suggests a slight upward trend or continued peak plateau compared to the previous 10-week average of ~80. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by 16 consecutive arrivals). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the intensification of summer demand while maintaining enough stability to avoid over-ordering on the single 119 spike. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the current volatility. Parameters L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified entering peak summer (July): the last 5 periods (since June 3rd) averaged 87.8 units/week, up from the previous regime average of ~78.

The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt (Divided Basics), which is highly seasonal towards summer. We are currently in early July (2019/7/8), entering peak summer. Historically, demand shifted from ~21 to ~70 in February, then stabilized around ~84-90 in June. However, the last two periods (Period 20 and 21) showed a significant spike to 119 and 122 units respectively. This aligns with peak seasonal July demand for cotton t-shirts. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 339 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock-out risk during peak demand (inventory hit zero in Period 21), I am shifting \u03bc\u0302 to reflect the most recent two-week local peak (approx 120/week) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this intensification. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader summer trend while acknowledging the recent spike, and 'calculate' for lead time as it is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked significantly in early July (Periods 20-21), averaging 120.5 units/week, a +37% increase over the previous summer regime (~88/week).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period (July 15) for a fitted T-shirt. The carry-over insights and recent history show a strong demand surge starting in late June. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has averaged 107.3 units/week (119, 122, 81), significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~88. However, recent arriving stock was based on lower order quantities from P17 (48) and P18 (36), leading to stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to capture this heightened summer seasonality using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate lead time, which remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods (5 periods) at an average of ~107 units/week ensures the backend base stock targets approximately 535 units, which aligns with the high service level required for a $19 profit product.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime confirmed across P20-P22 (July): mean demand increased to 107.3 units/week, up from ~88 (+22%). Continuous stockouts in P21-P22 due to lag in inventory replacement.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted cotton T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer demand phase (July). Recent demand (Periods 20-23) has averaged 103.5 units/week, significantly higher than the previous summer average of ~88. Due to this surprise peak, we have experienced stockouts over the last three periods (P21-P23) because arrivals from orders placed 4 weeks ago (P17-P19) were insufficient. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from stockouts and meet the high July/August demand, I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture this peak regime (~103.5 * 5 = 517.5). High sigma_hat via recent_N (N=4) will increase the safety stock to protect against further demand volatility during this peak season. The OR backend will calculate the order to bridge the gap between the current pipeline (480 units) and the required base stock (~517 + safety).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is currently in its peak summer demand regime (July). Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 111.8 units, significantly higher than the previous spring/summer average of ~85. High demand combined with the 4-period lead time has caused continuous stockouts from P21 to P24, as incoming shipments (ordered during the lower-demand period) are insufficient to meet current volume. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from stockouts and account for the elevated demand through August, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the peak regime) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the ~112 units/week mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen during this peak. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this high-regime demand.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (July) for SKU 678342002 established: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 111.8 units, representing a sustained ~25-30% increase over the previous high-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Divided Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand peak summer regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P20-P25) shows an average demand of 114.7 units, significantly higher than the earlier summer average of ~88. Periods 24 and 25 recorded demands of 145 and 129 respectively, leading to frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 5 consecutive periods except for the most recent arrival). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given we are in early August (2019-08-05), I expect this high demand to persist for at least another 2-3 weeks before the late-summer/back-to-school transition. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (which is $19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6-period average (representing the July-August peak) and keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods. The goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the high consumption rate through the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand (July/August) for SKU 678342002 has stabilized at a higher level: 6-period average (P20-P25) is 114.7 units, confirmed by high demand (145, 129) and consistent stockouts.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is in the peak of its summer seasonal demand (early August). Recent demand (P20-P26) has averaged 114.7 units/week, up from the early summer average of ~88. Period 26 showed a slight dip to 97 units, but this follows a series of high-demand weeks (119, 122, 81, 92, 145, 129). To avoid the frequent stockouts observed in July, I am focusing on the most recent 7-period window (P20-P26) to capture this high-demand regime. This provides a mean demand of ~115 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased volume and the volatility of the peak summer season, while the stock on hand (24) and large pipeline (541) are factored into the final order calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 678342002 (Jersey T-shirt) shows a significant drop in Period 27 (47 units) compared to the July/August peak (avg ~114 units). This aligns with the transition from peak summer to late August, where seasonal demand for basic summer t-shirts typically begins to cool. However, because one low data point (P27: 47) might be an outlier or early noise, I will balance the forecast using a shorter recent window (N=4) to capture the possible downward trend while still accounting for the high demand in P24-P26. This period's mu_hat will use recent_N=4 (Avg[145, 129, 97, 47] = 104.5) to bridge the previous peak and the current drop. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 122 and in-transit is high (476), so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering significantly to avoid high holding costs as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Potential seasonal demand cooldown detected starting Period 27 (2019/8/12): demand dropped to 47 units from a 6-period average of 114.7 units (-59%). Monitoring for sustained decline into late August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Divided Basics Fitted T-shirt) is showing signals of a seasonal transition from peak summer demand to a lower late-August/early-fall regime. After a July/early-August peak averaging ~115 units/week (Periods 20-25), demand in the last two periods has dropped to 47 and 86 respectively (average: 66.5). Period 27's drop was significant (-59% from peak), and while Period 28 saw a slight rebound to 86, it remains well below the summer peak. We are shifting mu_hat to a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture this cooldown while maintaining some safety stock for the end of summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 24 consecutive observations. Inventory position is currently high (on-hand + in-transit = 596) due to the large orders placed during the July peak arriving now, which aligns with the need to moderate order volume as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand cooldown confirmed for late August: demand dropped from a peak summer average of ~115 (P20-P25) to a two-week average of 66.5 (P27-P28), a ~42% reduction.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently entering Period 30 (2019/09/02). The carry-over insights and recent demand data (P27: 47, P28: 86, P29: 76) confirm a seasonal cooldown from the peak summer regime (~115 units/week) to a new late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand of the last three periods (P27-P29) is 69.7 units/week. This aligns with the 'Divided Basics' T-shirt category transitioning out of peak summer. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 223, In-transit: 297) because large orders placed during the July peak are still arriving (P26-P28 orders total 297 units). To prevent excessive holding costs during this demand decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand decline confirmed (starting P27): Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 70 units/week (P27-P29 average is 69.7), down from the peak of ~115.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The carry-over insights and recent history (P27-P30) confirm a significant demand decline post-summer peak, transitioning from ~115 units/week down to a lower regime averaging approximately 64 units/week (last 4 weeks: 47, 86, 76, 47). On-hand inventory is high (309 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak summer regime (P25 at 151 units, P26 at 133 units). With 309 units on-hand and an additional 164 units in-transit, the current total pipeline of 473 units covers over 7 weeks of demand at the current 64/week average. To avoid excessive holding costs in this cooldown phase, I am selecting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new lower demand regime and using the standard lead time of 4. No additional orders are needed at this stage, so the backend cap or high inventory will naturally keep the order at 0.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678342002 (a basic cotton T-shirt) has clearly transitioned from a peak summer regime (~115 units/week) to a post-summer cooldown regime starting around Period 27 (mid-August). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 60 units/week (47, 86, 76, 47, 44), significantly lower than the July peak. On-hand inventory is currently very high (345 units) because orders placed during the high-demand period (P23-P27) are still arriving, while demand has concurrently dropped. With 345 units on hand and 84 in-transit (P28 order), the current pipeline (429 units) is more than sufficient to cover at least 7 weeks of demand at the current rate of ~60 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime (N=5) to prevent further overstocking and allow the backend to use the existing inventory before placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand cooldown for SKU 678342002 established: 5-period average (P27-P31) is 60.0 units, a ~48% reduction from the peak summer average (~115 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has entered a post-peak summer cooldown. Starting in mid-August (Period 27), demand dropped from a summer high of ~115 units/week to a recent 6-period average of 56.3 units/week (Periods 27-32). The most recent observation (Period 32) reflects a further decline to 28 units, suggesting that demand is returning toward early-year levels (historical mean was ~21). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 401 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the summer peak (Periods 25-28), which significantly exceeds current demand requirements. The pipeline is now empty (In-transit: 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the post-summer regime. This will prevent further ordering while the OR backend burns through existing inventory, minimizing holding costs while demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand decline for SKU 678342002 is persistent: 6-period average (P27-P32) is 56.3 units, compared to the peak summer regime of ~115 units (-51%). Latest demand (P32: 28 units) suggests a return toward historical baseline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is currently in a sustained demand cooldown phase following its summer peak. Current date is late September (2019-09-30). Demand has shifted from a peak of ~115 units/week (P20-P25) to a much lower regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is 53.0 units. The most recent demand (P32: 28, P33: 43) suggests the product is returning toward its initial historical baseline (approx. 20-30 units) or stabilizing at a moderate autumn level. On-hand inventory is very high (358 units) because large orders placed during the summer peak (P25-P28) arrived just as demand dropped. With a current on-hand inventory of 358 and recent demand averaging ~53/week, we have over 6 weeks of stock. Since the lead time is 4 weeks, we are significantly overstocked. My parameters reflect this lower demand regime (using recent_N=7 to capture the post-summer decline) to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the surplus is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed (P27-P33): Demand has averaged 53.0 units/week over the last 7 weeks, a 54% reduction from the summer peak (~115 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678342002 (Fitted T-shirt/Basics) has transitioned out of the peak summer regime (approx. 115 units/week) into a post-summer cooldown starting around Period 27 (mid-August). Over the last 8 weeks (P27-P34), demand has averaged 52.9 units per week, with recent observations showing stabilization around 40-50 units. We currently have 306 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods and we have sufficient stock for the lead time plus review period (5 periods x ~53 units = 265 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect this stable 'post-peak' regime and use calculate for L as actual delivery has consistently matched the 4-period promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization (P27-P34): Demand for basics has settled into a new regime averaging 52.9 units/week, a ~54% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Divided Basics' Fitted T-shirt has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Following the peak summer average of ~115 units, demand has consistently averaged 50.4 units over the last 9 periods (P27-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 273 units with 28 units in-transit. With an 8-period mean demand of approx. 50, current inventory covers over 5 periods, which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. No new orders were placed from P29-P34 because inventory levels were extremely high (reaching 400+). We resumed ordering in P35. To maintain service levels for this stable regime, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the cooldown started) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the lower mean and reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P27 onwards) for basics has stabilized at an average of 50.4 units/week, a ~56% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678342002 (Fitted T-shirt) has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Since Period 27 (mid-August), the average demand is 50.4 units/week. However, zooming in on the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36), demand has softened further to an average of 37 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high (246 units), which covers over 6 weeks of demand at the recent average. Orders from P35 (28 units) and P36 (22 units) are in transit and expected in P39 and P40 respectively. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand for a 5-period window (L+1). With demand trending lower toward the original historical baseline (21.4), I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer stabilization while acknowledging the recent softness. This will prevent over-ordering while the system burns through existing surplus on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this basic T-shirt SKU. Over the last 11 periods (P27-P37), demand has stabilized significantly after the July peak (~115 units), averaging 47.7 units/week. More recently, the last 6 periods (P32-P37) have shown an even lower and more stable average of 35.8 units/week, with the latest demand being 32 units. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 214, In-transit: 67) are relatively high for this lower demand regime, which explains why no orders were placed between P29 and P34. We resumed ordering small amounts in P35-P37 to maintain a steady flow as on-hand stocks slowly deplete. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable late-autumn baseline (approx 36 units/week) and avoid over-ordering based on the summer peak or the immediate post-summer transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand for basics has settled into a stable autumn regime: the 6-period average (P32-P37) is 35.8 units/week, down from the immediate post-peak average of ~53 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Divided Basics T-shirt) has transitioned from a high summer peak (~115 units/week) to a stable autumn regime. Since Period 32, demand has consistently stayed in a lower range, with the last 7 periods (P32-P38) averaging 36.7 units/week. This aligns with the 'post-summer' seasonality for cotton jersey basics. Inventory levels are currently high (172 on-hand) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on extensive history. To prevent overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for this high-margin item (95% target critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the most recent stabilized autumn regime. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current pipeline surplus.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime established (P32-P38): Demand for basics has stabilized at an average of 36.7 units/week, a significant reduction from both the summer peak (~115) and the early post-summer transition (~53).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678342002 (Jersey Basic Fitted T-shirt) has stabilized into an autumn/winter regime. Over the last 8 weeks (P32-P39), demand has averaged 36.6 units/week, which is consistent with the established carry-over insight for the autumn season. The current on-hand inventory is 164 units with 39 units in-transit (ordered P36 and P37). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 weeks of demand at ~37 units/week is roughly 185 units. Our total pipeline (164 on-hand + 39 in-transit = 203) is currently sufficient to cover this requirement without placing a new order this period, especially considering the holding cost of $1.0 vs potential profit. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 8-period window (N=8) to reflect the stabilized autumn demand regime and allow the OR engine to maintain this level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18. We are in a stable autumn demand regime for this basic fitted t-shirt. Since Period 32, demand has fluctuated at a lower level, with the last 9 periods (P32-P40) averaging 33.7 units/week. The most recent demand (Period 40) was particularly low at 10 units, but this follows a period of 36 units, suggesting typical weekly volatility rather than a new downward trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (176 units) relative to recent demand, as we draw down stock from the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (recent_N=9) to capture this established autumn baseline (avg ~34) while ignoring the summer peak. The OR backend will likely place a small or zero order given the high inventory and low current demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime for basics remains stable (P32-P40): average demand is 33.7 units/week, a significant reduction from the summer peak (~115) and early autumn transition (~53).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 42), historically a period of stable to low demand for basic T-shirts as winter approaches. The demand regime has stabilized following the post-summer decline. Since Period 32 (eight weeks), demand has averaged 33.7 units/week. Recent periods (P40-P41) show even lower demand (10 and 18 units respectively), suggesting a possible further seasonal dip or typical volatility for autumn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 175 units, which covers approximately 5.2 weeks of demand at the current average (33.7), while in-transit is 20 units (ordered P40-P41). Total available inventory (195) is sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand and provide a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the stable autumn regime while smoothing out the very recent low outliers, and 'calculate' for lead time as it remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand for the Fitted T-shirt (Divided Basics category) has stabilized in an 'Autumn/Winter' regime. Since Period 32 (early October), demand has averaged 30.5 units/week (last 11 periods), with the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 27.8 units/week. This represents a significant decrease from the summer peak (~115) and the post-summer transition (~53). On-hand inventory is currently 142 units, which is high relative to the current weekly demand of ~28 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that align with this stable low-demand regime to slowly burn off excess inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (dating back to Period 32 when the low regime solidified) to capture the current mean while allowing the high on-hand balance to naturally reduce orders until inventory reaches equilibrium with the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime for basics established: 11-period average (P32-P42) is 30.5 units/week, down from the early autumn average of ~53 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Jersey Basic Fitted T-shirt) is in a stable winter demand regime. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P32-P43) is approximately 31.5 units/week. Recent samples (P40-P43: 10, 18, 33, 14) show some volatility but remain well below the autumn transition average (~53). On-hand inventory is 128 units, with 62 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P40, P41, P42, P43). Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 5 * 31.5 = 157.5 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 190, which is sufficient for the current regime. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 12 periods (N=12) to capture the winter stabilization, while defaulting sigma_hat to account for recent variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678342002 (Divided Basics Fitted T-shirt) has settled into its winter regime. Over the last 13 periods (since Period 32), demand has averaged approximately 29.5 units/week. The last 5 periods (P40-P44) have shown even lower demand, averaging 17.4 units/week, though this includes a notable low of 10 in P40. On-hand inventory is currently at 128 units, with 136 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, my current inventory covers nearly 9 weeks of future demand at the recent average of ~30/week, or much longer if the 17/week trend continues. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the full winter regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as N=13 covers the period since the last major shift detected in the carry-over insights (P32). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. No adjustments are needed to stock up further, as current inventory levels are high relative to winter demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Cotton Fitted T-shirt) is currently in a stable winter demand regime. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P32-P45) is 30.0 units/week. While demand peaked in summer (>110/week), the current trend is consistent and low, reflecting the seasonal irrelevance of t-shirts in late December. On-hand inventory is 118 units, and in-transit inventory is 128 units (from orders in P42, P43, P44). Given a lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory is 246 units. This covers approximately 8.2 weeks of demand at the current 30 units/week rate. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline is healthy and we are nearing the end of the year, I am using recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-summer stabilization while maintaining high service levels for these basics through the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt', a basic garment currently in the late winter/end-of-year period (2019/12/30). Demand has entered a low-volume winter regime. Since Period 32 (September 16th), the average demand has been approximately 30.5 units/week. However, the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) show even lower volatility and demand (avg 16.2 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (123 units) relative to recent demand, and the substantial in-transit volume (117 units), no aggressive ordering is required. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=15) approach for mu_hat to capture the shift from autumn to winter while smoothing out localized noise, and maintain a default sigma estimation to account for standard variability in basics.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P42-P46) shows further cooling: 5-period average is 16.2 units/week, down from the early autumn average of ~33 units.
