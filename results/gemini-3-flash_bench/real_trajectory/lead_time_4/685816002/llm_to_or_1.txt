Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, a staple garment likely to have relatively stable baseline demand, though potentially affected by seasonal changes. The historical demand data (5 samples) shows mean=64.0 and std=8.46. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero, we need to establish a baseline order to cover the promised lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (L+1=5). No shipment data is available yet to assess actual lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the most recent demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT (Men's Cotton T-shirt), which is a staple item with typically stable demand. In Period 1, there was a demand of 96 units, which exceeded the historical samples (mean ~64, max 76). However, because we started with 0 inventory and the promised lead time is 4 periods, no units were sold and we ended with 0 inventory. The 81 units ordered in Period 1 are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (1+4). Given the historical mean (~64) and the recent spike to 96, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6, including the new Period 1 data) to slightly adjust for the higher observation without overreacting to a single point. L is kept at default as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 177 units in transit (81 ordered in P1, 96 in P2). Demand in P1 (96) and P2 (102) has been significantly higher than the initial historical samples from Jan/early Feb (avg ~64). As a basic cotton T-shirt, this item likely sees steady utility demand; the recent spike indicates a clear regime shift or seasonality starting mid-February. I will use recent_N=5 (covering the 3 available historical weeks and 2 game periods) to capture this higher demand trend. The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected in P5 arrival phase, visible P6; P2 order expected P6 arrival phase, visible P7). I will stick to the default lead time (4) as there is no evidence yet of deviation. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N to reflect the recent demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~64 to ~100 (+56%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Looking at the history, the demand regime shifted around 2019-02-11 (Period 1) from an average of ~64 (pre-game) to ~105 (average of Periods 1-3). The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, which is a stable staple but is currently experiencing a significant step-up in demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not yet arrived (as expected, L=4 means they arrive in Period 5). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we have high demand, the system is currently stock-out constrained. I will set L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the new demand regime (mean ~105), which results in a base stock covering (1+4) * 105 = 525 units. This will help the OR backend calculate an order that accounts for the persistent higher demand while waiting for the first shipments to arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a Men's Round-necked T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 66 units (Jan), but since Period 1 (2019-02-11), it shifted to a significantly higher regime averaging approximately 100 units (96, 102, 119, 82). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units in pipeline. The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time rules, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Thus, no arrivals should have been seen yet. I am maintaining L=4 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (mean ~100) across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime, which will help the OR engine set a sufficient base stock to recover from the current stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Men's Basic T-shirt. Historical data before Period 1 showed an average demand of ~64. Since Period 1, we've seen a shift to a higher regime: P1-P5 demand values are 96, 102, 119, 82, 65, averaging ~92.8. The latest 'conclude' message (P5) finally confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods (Order P1 arrived in P5). Currently, we have 16 units on hand and 459 in transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from P2 (96), P3 (112), P4 (126), and P5 (125), which are expected to arrive in P6, P7, P8, and P9 respectively. Given the demand is relatively stable at the new higher level (~93), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P1-P5) to reflect this new regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 samples to capture the recent volatility. L remains default since the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 1-5 average demand is 92.8, significantly higher (+45%) than the initial pre-game average of 64.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is holding steady (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). Regarding demand: the initial provided samples (Jan/early Feb) averaged 64 units/week. Periods 1-3 saw a spike (avg ~105), but Periods 4-6 have seen a significant cooling (82, 65, 56). The product is a basic Ronny RN T-shirt; the early Feb peak likely corresponded to pre-spring stocking or a specific promotion, while the current trend suggests a return towards a lower baseline. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 captures this cooling trend (avg ~68) better than the longer-term average, preventing excessive overstocking as on-hand inventory starts to build up (56 units) and 428 units are in-transit. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods is accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: After a surge to ~105/week in Periods 1-3, demand in Periods 4-6 has declined to an average of 67.7/week (-35% from surge peak).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), we observe a sustained demand softening. Initial demand (Periods 1-3) averaged ~105.6 units/week, while recent demand (Periods 4-7) has averaged 66.25 units/week, which is very close to the pre-game baseline of 64. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 106 units on-hand and 316 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, and P6), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the lower 66.25 average (totaling ~331 for the 1+L=5 period horizon) and use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility observed during the game. This should prevent over-ordering as the initial surge fades.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 4-7 average demand (66.25) returned to pre-game baseline levels (~64), confirming the early February/March surge was temporary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2328.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed a significant demand spike to 128 units, which contradicts the stabilization around ~66 units seen in Periods 4-7. This spike (2019-04-01) aligns with the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019) or general spring seasonal increases for basic apparel like t-shirts. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8). Given the recent volatility and the possibility of a new seasonal regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this recent spike while maintaining some historical context. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased variance observed in the last period. On-hand is 104 and In-transit is 190, which is healthy, but we must protect against a continued upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 8 (demand=128), reversing the downward trend seen in Periods 4-7; likely seasonal spring/Easter influence starting early April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are observing the start of a spring demand regime for this basic T-shirt. Demand in Period 8 was 128 and Period 9 was 100, significantly higher than the mid-March average of ~64. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 82.2, but the most recent two weeks (128, 100) suggest a higher active mean around 100-110 units as we approach late April. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7, P4 at P8, P5 at P9). On-hand inventory is 129 units, and 192 units are in transit (P6: 65, P7: 0, P8: 0, P9: 127). The P6 order is expected to arrive this period. To handle the increased demand and volatility seen in the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 5 periods (L+1) at an expected rate of 105 units/period (525). I will use a larger sigma_hat to account for the recent spike to 128.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased to an average of 114 over the last two weeks (P8-P9), up from the ~66 average seen in P4-P7. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the Ronny Regular Round-Neck T-shirt has shown a clear upward shift since early April (Period 8), likely driven by the spring season as the product is a basic cotton T-shirt. Over the last three weeks (P8-P10), demand has averaged 106 units (128, 100, 90), compared to the prior period's average of ~66. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across five consecutive arrivals (P5-P10). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this higher spring demand level (N=3 because the regime shift occurred 3 periods ago). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition into the spring season. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and well-documented.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for basic t-shirts confirmed (P8-P10): avg demand increased to 106 units per week from a previous baseline of 66 (+60%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29) shows a stockout (on-hand=0) due to a late-spring demand surge (158 units in Period 11) and zero arrivals in Period 11 (the order from Period 7 was for 0 units). Demand analysis confirms a sustained spring regime (P8-P11 average = 119 units), significantly higher than the previous baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history (P10 arrive P6). The stockout is temporary as the pipeline (419 units) includes arrivals from P9 (127 units), P10 (153 units), and P11 (139 units) scheduled for Periods 13, 14, and 15 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new elevated spring demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level (target for L+1 periods) reflects the current average of ~119 units/week plus safety stock for the high volatility (std dev ~29).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for basic t-shirts intensified (P8-P11): average demand increased to 119 units per week (+85% from winter baseline). Low stock availability in P11 caused lost sales.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand spring regime for men's cotton t-shirts (May 6th). Demand has surged significantly starting around Period 8 (early April), with the last five periods (P8-P12) showing demand values of 128, 100, 90, 158, and 129, averaging approximately 121 units/week. This is a substantial increase over the winter baseline of ~65. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our stock-out continued in Period 12, so there's an urgent need to rebuild inventory. However, we have 589 units in transit including large orders from P9 (127), P10 (153), P11 (139), and P12 (170). The order from P9 is expected to arrive during the current Period 13 and will be visible in the next Period 14 start. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand spring regime (avg 121) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation ~26). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the current demand trend plus safety stock across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (P8-P12) confirmed stable at a high level: average demand of 121 units/week (+83% vs winter baseline of ~66). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1673.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P8-P13) for the Ronny Regular Round Neck T-shirt reflects a sustained spring/pre-summer regime with an average demand of approximately 116 units per week (128, 100, 90, 158, 129, 90). The sudden zero arrival in Periods 11 and 12 (corresponding to orders from Periods 7 and 8) is explained by the fact that those orders were zero (0 units ordered). Normal arrivals resumed in P13 from the P9 order, confirming the lead time remains precisely 4 periods. With on-hand inventory low (37) and a total pipeline of 577 units (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13), the current coverage is actually quite high to protect against the ongoing spring surge. I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the spring regime average (approx 116/week) across the (L+1)=5 week lead period, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (e.g., the 158 spike in P11).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20. Following the intensely high 'Spring demand regime' (P8-P12) which averaged ~121 units/week, the last two weeks (P13-P14) have averaged 111.5 units/week. While demand remains elevated compared to the winter baseline (~64), the slight cooling suggests stabilization at a high level. Lead time consistency is reliable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P9 and P10. There is a potential risk regarding the orders placed in P7 and P8 (ordered=0), which effectively created an 'arrival gap' in P11 and P12. We are now seeing the recovery of the pipeline with 490 units in transit following aggressive ordering in P10-P13. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, mu_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand spring period (avg \u2248 118) while discounting the earlier low-demand months.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Cotton Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring/summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 131.6 units per week, which is a significant increase from the previous 'Spring' average of ~114-121. Lead time has been recovered from some missing/delayed shipments to a consistent 4 periods (P9, P10, and P11 all arrived with L=4). Although P7 and P8 orders did not arrive (likely lost), the pipeline inventory (490) plus on-hand (48) is currently sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (P8-P15) to capture this higher seasonal baseline (average ~122/week) while providing enough safety stock via recent_N sigma_hat to manage the increased volatility (128 to 158 units range).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for basic t-shirts intensified further (P11-P15): average demand increased to 132 units per week (+100% vs winter baseline of ~66). Shipment loss confirmed for orders placed in P7 and P8.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a jersey cotton round-neck t-shirt, currently in the peak summer demand phase (early June). Demand in the last 4 periods (P13-P16) averaged 136.5 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime (+100% vs winter baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful arrivals, but shipments from P7 and P8 are confirmed lost. In-transit inventory covers orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16. The current on-hand inventory is low (43), and the system needs to maintain high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the full breadth of the intensified spring/summer surge (average demand approx 129), and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the heightened volatility observed (demand range 90-175). L will be set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period arrival window observed for recent successful orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (P13-P16): average demand increased to 136.5 units/week. Volatility is high with demand peaking at 175 units in P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-10, peak summer season for cotton T-shirts. Demand has intensified significantly, with a recent average of 144 units/week (P13-P17) and 158 units most recently. We are also monitoring for further shipment losses, as orders from P7 and P8 were previously confirmed lost. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful arrivals. On-hand inventory is 0, so we are entirely dependent on the Period 14 order (66 units) arriving at the start of Period 18 to satisfy demand. With lead time L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the summer demand regime of ~145 units/week (145 * 5 = 725) and use an explicit sigma to account for the high volatility observed (standard deviation is roughly 25-30, so sqrt(5)*30 \u2248 67). A high service level is necessary due to the unit profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1) ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand persists: Average demand for Period 13-17 is 144.8 units/week (+120% vs winter baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for all non-lost shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a basic cotton round-necked T-shirt, which is experiencing a sustained peak demand regime during the summer season (June). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 146.2 units/week, significantly higher than the spring average. We are currently facing a stockout situation (on-hand = 0) because the arrival in Period 18 (ordered in P14) was only 66 units, while demand remains high (117-175 range). The pipeline includes orders from Period 15 (139 units), Period 16 (165 units), Period 17 (187 units), and Period 18 (195 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the best estimate for successful deliveries, although P7 and P8 orders were previously confirmed lost. To recover from the stockout and meet the summer demand peak, I will use a recent N=5 approach for mu_hat (146.2 * 5 = 731) and sigma_hat to capture recent summer volatility. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a high base stock to cover the expected 146+ units per week for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained (P14-P18): Average demand stabilized at 146.2 units/week (+120% vs winter baseline).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic cotton round-necked T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer demand regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P14-P19), demand has averaged 140.8 units per week, significantly higher than earlier regimes. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the consistent actual lead time for successful deliveries, although history (P7, P8) shows occasional shipment losses. Current on-hand inventory is low (25 units) and we are recovering from stockouts in P17 and P18. To ensure high service levels during this June/July peak, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current summer demand average (~141 * 5 = 705) and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (standard deviation ~23.5). The OR backend's service level logic (profit $19 vs holding $1) will naturally target a high cycle service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this high-margin basic.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P14-P19) confirmed: average demand is 140.8 units/week (+113% vs winter baseline). Volatility remains high with standard deviation of ~23.5.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic round-necked T-shirt (summer-relevant). Current demand analysis (Periods 14-20) shows a sustained high-demand summer regime with an average of 146.3 units/week and a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. Period 20 demand was quite high (179 units), confirming we are in the peak summer season (July 1st). Lead times for delivered orders have remained stable at 4 periods, although shipments from Periods 7 and 8 were previously confirmed lost. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the specific summer regime (P14-P20) while accounting for the high volatility observed in recent weeks. This ensures the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate for a high-profit item ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P14-P20) confirmed: average demand is 146.3 units/week with high volatility (std dev ~27).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 8th, 2019, which is the height of the summer demand peak for basic t-shirts. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime. The most recent demand (Period 21) was 137 units, following a peak of 179 in Period 20. Over the last 8 periods (P14-P21), the average demand is 146.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this sustained summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it accurately reflects the current high mean and high volatility (~24-27 std dev). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the arrival from P17 in P21, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained summer demand period for basic t-shirts. Demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has averaged 133 units/week, which is consistent with the summer regime detected since Period 14. Although the last two weeks (P21-P22) saw a slight dip to 137 and 118 respectively, this is within normal volatility for this SKU. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. On-hand inventory is healthy at 138 units, but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand during the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 weeks). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the summer regime from P14 to P22) to capture the current stable high-demand period while smoothing out weekly fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 9 periods to account for the increased volatility observed during the peak season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (2019/7/22). Reviewing the demand history, specifically Periods 21-23 (demands: 137, 118, 102), there is a clear softening trend from the peak summer average of ~146. The last three periods average 119 units/week. This suggests the peak summer demand is beginning to wind down as we move towards late August. To avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs on a cotton jersey t-shirt as the season transitions, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23), which captures both the end of the peak and the start of the decline (average ~118). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P21, P22, and P23 all showing a 4-period duration). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility compared to the mid-summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening from summer peak: Average demand for Period 21-23 is 119 units/week, down 18% from the previous summer average of 146.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. Demand for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' is showing a clear post-summer softening trend. Demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) has been 137, 118, 102, and 82, respectively. The average for this specific window is 109.75, which is a significant drop from the summer peak average of ~146 units/week. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (175) and a substantial pipeline (504), the goal is to prevent overstocking as we exit the peak season. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend and use sigma_hat default to maintain a safe buffer against the high variance observed during the transition. L remains default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed: Average demand for Period 21-24 is 110 units/week, a 25% decrease from the summer peak of 146, indicating the end of the seasonal high.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' is clearly softening as we exit the summer season. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has dropped to 99 units, and the most recent period saw a further decline to 56 units. This is consistent with the 'demand softening' insight from Period 25. Given the high on-hand inventory (309) and in-transit (317), we are currently overstocked for the current demand regime. The objective is to reduce inventory to avoid high holding costs while still covering the expected (L+1) demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and higher ongoing volatility compared to the winter baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: Average demand for Periods 21-25 is 99 units/week, a 32% decrease from the summer peak average of 146.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816002 (Men's Basic T-shirt) has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak. Average demand over the last six periods (P21-P26) has dropped to approximately 96 units/week, with the most recent two weeks averaging 69 units. This represents a significant decline from the summer average of ~146 units. We are currently in a high inventory position with on-hand units (376) roughly equal to 4-5 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (168) is arriving as expected (confirmed lead time of 4 periods). Given the high on-hand stock and the cooling demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-summer decline. This will allow the base stock to naturally contract, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the current demand level.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand decline for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT'. Demand has significantly decreased from the summer peak (avg ~146) to a new stabilized lower regime. Over the last five periods (P23-P27), demand has been 102, 82, 56, 82, and 108, averaging 86 units per week. The inventory position is currently very high (on-hand 372), which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods), as 5 * 86 = 430, and we have 372 + 108 = 480 units in the total pipeline. Since on-hand inventory is high, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the post-summer environment and allow the OR backend to minimize holding costs while the existing stock is consumed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized (P23-P27): Average demand is 86 units/week, down 41% from the summer peak average of 146.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' is currently in a post-summer stabilization phase. While there was a slight uptick in the last two periods (P27: 108, P28: 115), the overall trend since the summer peak (avg ~146) has settled much lower. The most recent 6 periods (P23-P28) show an average demand of 90.8 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory levels are high (On-hand: 318, Pipeline: 73) due to large orders placed earlier during the softening phase. With a current inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of 391 units and an expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) of roughly 455 units (using the recent average of ~91), the system needs to maintain a moderate base stock to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the recent slight variance increase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stabilized post-summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized (P23-P28): Average demand is 91 units/week, down 38% from the summer peak average of 146.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Men's Basic T-shirt) has transitioned from a summer peak (avg ~146) to a stable post-summer regime. For the last seven periods (P23-P29), demand has averaged 91.57 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 19.9. The most recent demand (P29) was 96 units, confirming this stabilized lower level. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 25 order exactly 4 periods later in Period 29. Inventory is currently healthy with 225 units on-hand and 197 in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer demand pattern accurately while ignoring the previous high-volatility summer peaks. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in history.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (T-shirt) is in a post-summer stabilizing phase. Current date is Sep 9, 2019. Demand has shifted from a summer peak of ~146 units/week to a more stable regime. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), the average demand is 91.8 units/week. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P27-P30) show an average of 103.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3, indicating lower volatility than in previous months. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed up to Period 25), though the Period 26 order (which arrived in Period 30) was for 0 units, making it look like an arrival failed in 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 131, and pipeline inventory is 307. To align with this new stabilized demand, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer baseline and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility. L will remain at the default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized (P23-P30): Average demand is 91.8 units/week, with volatility significantly decreasing compared to summer peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic round-neck t-shirt has transitioned into a stable 'post-summer' regime. Over the last 9 periods (P23-P31), the average demand is 90.4 units/week. This is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~140-150 units/week. Recent periods (P29-P31) show demand levels of 96, 94, and 79, reinforcing this stabilization around the ~90 mark. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as evidenced by the P27 order arriving in P31). A shipment loss occurred for the order on P26 (ordered 0, but technically due now), and the P25 order (3 units) arrived as expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 and in-transit is 322. Given the (L+1) horizon requirement (effectively 5 weeks), and a mean demand of ~90, the total pipeline requirement is ~450 units. Pipeline inventory (96 OH + 322 IT = 418) is slightly below this target. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the entire stable post-summer period (P23-P31), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the summer months.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand stabilization phase for this basic t-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P28-P32) has been [115, 96, 94, 79, 59], showing a gradual decline and stabilization compared to the summer peak (avg ~146). The most recent regime (last 10 periods, P23-P32) has an average demand of 92.2 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, although shipments from P7, P8, and notably P26 were lost or non-concluded. The current on-hand inventory is 63, and the pipeline is 396. To avoid overstocking while demand softens further into autumn, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods (covering late July to mid-September) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (approx 92) and the reduced volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 90-100 unit/week environment rather than the high-volume summer period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently in a stabilized post-summer demand regime. Analysis of demand from Period 23 to Period 33 shows an average demand of approximately 92.8 units per week, which is significantly lower than the summer peak of 146 units. Recent periods (P31-P33) show demand values of 79, 59, and 117, maintaining this lower average but exhibiting moderate volatility. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipments in P7-P8 and the zero arrival in P30 (which was expected as Period 26 had 0 units ordered). Current on-hand inventory is 73 units, and with 319 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the stable post-summer period since P23) to capture the current mean of ~93 units per week, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same N to account for the current volatility level. Lead time L will remain at the promised 'default' of 4.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Analyzing the most recent demand samples (P30-P34: 94, 79, 59, 117, 100), the average is 89.8 units per week. This aligns with the 'post-summer' carry-over insight of approximately 91-92 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders from P27, P28, P29, and P30 all arriving exactly after 4 periods (P31, P32, P33, P34). The shipment from P26 (ordered 0) is trivial. Total pipeline inventory is 333 units, which, combined with 83 units on-hand, totals 416 units. At a forecast of ~90 units/week, this covers roughly 4.6 periods, which is sufficient for the L+1 window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 weeks (N=12) to capture this stable post-summer trend while including enough variance to handle the standard fluctuations (P23-P34). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time remains exactly at the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October 2019. Demand for this SKU (basic round-neck t-shirt) has stabilized following the summer peak and the post-summer decline. For the last 13 periods (P23-P35), demand has averaged 92.5 units/week. Over the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), it has averaged 89.4 units/week. Given the stability, I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the current post-summer regime while maintaining enough sample size to account for weekly variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31-P35 arrivals). The pipeline is healthy with 50 units on-hand and 386 in-transit (P32-P35 orders). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 will provide a robust basis for the OR backend to set the base stock level to cover approximately 5 weeks of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for basic t-shirts stabilized (P23-P35): average demand is 92.5 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 18 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' (a basic cotton t-shirt) has entered a stable post-summer regime. Over the last 14 periods (P23-P36), the demand has averaged approximately 91.5 units per week. Although Period 36 showed a low demand of 33, this appears to be a weekly fluctuation rather than a new regime shift, as this product category (basic underwear/jersey) typically maintains a consistent baseline outside of peak seasons. The lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 117 and in-transit at 375, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime (P23-P36) while filtering out the high-volatility summer peak. This provides the OR backend with a forecast of ~457 units for the 5-period (L+1) window, ensuring adequate service levels without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the year.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (cotton T-shirt) is currently in a stable post-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 15 periods (since Period 23) shows an average demand of approximately 88.6 units. However, the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) have shown slightly lower demand averaging 75.2 units, including a significant drop to 33 in P36 and 51 in P37. This suggests a potential late-autumn slowdown as demand for basic jersey T-shirts typically decreases in colder months. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P33 order arrived in P37). Given the high on-hand inventory (116) and substantial in-transit pipeline (355), the current stock position (471) is well above the projected (L+1) demand requirement (~375-440 units). I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the broader post-summer average while acknowledging the recent volatility, and sigma_hat with N=15 to ensure the service level is maintained despite recent variance. L remains at the default promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P23-P37) settled at an average of 88.6 units/week; however, the last 2 weeks (P36-P37) show a further decline to ~42 units/week, suggesting secondary seasonal cooling as winter approaches.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are observing a significant decline in demand for basic t-shirts as winter approaches. The demand in the last three periods (P36-P38) has been 33, 51, and 68 units, averaging 50.7 units/week. This is a sharp contrast to the stable post-summer regime of ~92 units/week. I am detecting a secondary seasonal cooling regime. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand period, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the length of this new cooling regime) to reflect this lower mean. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to recent_N=3 to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P34 order in P38.

Carry-over insight: Secondary seasonal cooling confirmed: Demand in P36-P38 dropped to an average of 51 units/week, a 45% decrease from the previous post-summer average of 92 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $976.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a secondary seasonal cooling phase as winter approaches, confirmed by demand in the last four periods (P36-P39: 33, 51, 68, 63) averaging 53.75 units/week. This is a significant drop from the post-summer average of ~92. The current on-hand inventory is 221 units, with 162 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, total coverage needs to span 5 periods. At the current demand rate of ~54 units/week, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 270 units. Total pipeline (on-hand 221 + in-transit 162 = 383 units) already significantly exceeds this requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the cooling trend and use the default lead time (4) and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained secondary seasonal cooling: Demand for P36-P39 (Nov) stabilized at an average of 53.75 units/week, down 42% from the Sep/Oct average of 92 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), and the demand for this basic cotton round-necked T-shirt is in a 'secondary seasonal cooling' phase as winter approaches. Demand has been significantly lower over the past five periods (P36-P40) compared to the summer and autumn months. Specifically, the last four weeks (P37-P40) show a mean demand of 57.5 units/week (51, 68, 63, 48). Current on-hand inventory is 262 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand regime. With an expected lead time of 4 periods and the game ending at Period 47, we need to be very careful about overstocking to avoid high holding costs and excess ending inventory. Total inventory visibility (262 on-hand + 73 in-transit = 335) already covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand at the recent 57.5 units/week rate. No orders were placed in P39 and P40 due to this surplus. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the most recent cooling phase (P36-P40). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' (a basic t-shirt) has entered a late autumn cooling phase as we approach the end of November. For Periods 36-41, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower average of 53 units/week (P36: 33, P37: 51, P38: 68, P39: 63, P40: 48, P41: 55) compared to the post-summer average of ~92 and the summer peak of ~146. On-hand inventory is currently high (237 units) with 43 units in-transit (ordered in P38, expected to arrive in P42). This total inventory of 280 units covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand at the current rate (~53 * 5 = 265). Given we are at Period 42 out of 47, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 46, very close to the end of the game. To maximize profit and minimize ending inventory holding costs, I am shifting parameters to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering. I'll use method 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this current cooling regime.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand cooling regime confirmed (P36-P41): average demand settled at 53 units/week, a 42% decrease from the Sep/Oct average of 92 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed an unexpected and massive demand spike of 207 units. This is a significant outlier compared to the 'secondary seasonal cooling' average of ~53 units/week observed over the previous six weeks (P36-P41). Given the date (Dec 2, 2019), this likely corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for a basic T-shirt SKU. Historically, demand has cooled significantly after major spikes. However, we must protect against remaining holiday volatility. With on-hand inventory at 73 and only 31 units in-transit (ordered P42, arriving P46), we are at risk if elevated demand persists. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture both the low-demand regime and the massive recent spike (avg ~75/week) to set a safer base stock while anticipating a return to lower levels before the game ends in Period 47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand jumped to 207 units (approx. 4x the previous 6-week average of 53), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are evaluating the aftermath of a significant demand spike in Period 42 (207 units), likely corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Following this, Period 43 demand returned to a level of 64 units, which is consistent with the late autumn baseline of ~53-60 units. As we approach mid-December, we expect demand to remain stable or slightly elevated due to holiday shopping, but not at the extreme level seen during the Black Friday peak. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) due to the large spike, while 204 units are in transit (31 from P42 and 173 from P43). Given a lead time of 4, the P42 order is expected during Period 46 and the P43 order in Period 47. To prevent stockouts in the final weeks of the game, I will set mu_hat based on the recent pre-spike regime (N=6, approximately Periods 36-41) to capture the winter baseline of ~53 units/week. Setting sigma_hat explicitly slightly higher (30) to account for holiday volatility and the risk of another smaller pre-Christmas spike. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains enough safety stock during the final lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed (P42): Demand reached 207 units (approx 4x baseline), followed by a return to ~64 units in P43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. In P42, demand spiked to 207, depleting our inventory. P43 and P44 saw demand return toward baseline levels (64 and 80), though we stocked out in P44. We have 306 units in-transit: 31 (from P42), 173 (from P43), and 102 (from P44). Based on the lead time of 4 periods, these are expected in P46, P47, and P48 respectively. However, we likely have a shipment loss or delay from P39-P41 orders (though zero units were ordered then, we expect nothing to arrive). The stockout in P44 (on-hand 0) is a result of the P42 spike. For P45, I will use an explicit forecast. While P42 was an outlier, P43-P44 suggest a baseline around 70-80 units/week. Since the game is ending in 2 periods (P47), and in-transit is already tracking high relative to baseline (306/4 is roughly 76 per week), I need to be careful not to over-order. I will set mu_hat based on an average of 80 units/week for 5 periods (L+1) to ensure we cover remaining demand without excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand stabilization: Following the P42 spike (207), demand returned to an average of 72 units/week in P43-P44, consistent with late-year baseline expectations for basic jersey t-shirts.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). We are recovering from the late November holiday spike and subsequent lead-time gap. High demand in P42 (207) and recent levels in P43-P45 (avg 82.6) indicate demand has stabilized at a late-year baseline higher than the early November trough. Specifically, P45 demand was 104, suggesting a pre-Christmas lift. Since the lead time is 4 periods, order arrivals from the large replenishment orders placed in P43 (173 units), P44 (102 units), and P45 (189 units) will not start arriving until P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Monitoring the in-transit balance (495 units), we must ensure we cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the post-holiday baseline (avg ~83). L is set to calculate as lead times have consistently been 4 periods when shipments are not lost.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand baseline (P43-P45) settled at approximately 83 units/week, up from the pre-holiday trough of 53 units/week (+56%).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. This is the end-of-year period. Following the massive Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike in P42 (207 units), demand has stabilized into a post-holiday baseline. The average demand for P43-P46 is 76.5 units, which is a significant increase from the pre-holiday trough of 53 units but much lower than the summer peak. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand: 0) due to the delayed resolution of orders placed during the high-demand spike. Specifically, orders from P43, P44, and P45 are still in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P42 order arriving in P46. To address the current regime (post-holiday baseline), I am setting mu_hat using the average of the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture the current mean of ~77 units/week. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect the moderate volatility observed after the holiday spike. The pipeline (464 units) is substantial, so the OR backend will likely order a small amount or zero to prevent overstocking as we enter the low-demand January period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand baseline (P43-P46) confirmed at ~77 units/week, transitioning from the P42 spike (207 units).
