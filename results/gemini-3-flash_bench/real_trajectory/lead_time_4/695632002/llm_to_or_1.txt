Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 695632002 (Gyda blouse). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 131.4 units (162, 139, 126, 85, 138). Given the date (Feb 11), we are post-holiday and pre-spring. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet, but the inventory must be built from scratch. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which incorporate all five available samples to establish a baseline. Since there have been no arrivals yet, I will use the default promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 177 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Consequently, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (ready for Period 6 decision). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 177 in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 113. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 162, 139, 126, 85, 138. The mean of these 5 samples is 130. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand and volatility is appropriate to capture the baseline while we wait for the first order to arrive. Profit/Holding ratio is 1.0, suggesting a target service level q = 0.5, which the OR backend will calculate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 334 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have not yet reached Period 5 (the earliest expected arrival for the Period 1 order), we cannot confirm if the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods. Demand for the last 5 samples (including those provided in historical demand data) has been: 162, 139, 126, 85, 138. The latest 'concluded' demands were 113 (P1) and 144 (P2). The mean demand across these 7 data points is approximately 129.5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will be low, focusing on minimizing inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the current stable regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Gyda blouse' is a seasonal women's garment. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from Period 1 should arrive in Period 5 (visible at P6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 494 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been steadily increasing: 113, 144, 174. The historical mean (including pre-game samples) is approximately 135, but recent data suggests a growth trend. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend in demand while maintaining the default lead time logic, as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to conclude an actual lead time shift.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695632002' (Womens Blouse) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the game started in Period 1, the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 100% lost sales over the first 4 periods. The historical demand samples (162, 139, 126, 85, 138) plus recorded demand in P1-P4 (113, 144, 174, 150) show a mean of approximately 136-140 per week. There is no clear seasonal trend yet (early spring), so I will use a recent_N strategy to capture the current demand level. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level. I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) until arrivals confirm a drift. Current pipeline (688 units) is being tracked correctly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 analysis for Gyda blouse (695632002). Current date is 2019-03-18. We have finally received the first shipment from Period 1 (177 units) with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 5 weeks has been consistent (113, 144, 174, 150, 168), averaging ~150 units per week. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 542 units (from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5), which covers roughly 3.6 periods of demand. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the item is a standard blouse, there are no immediate seasonal spikes expected in mid-March, though we keep an eye on spring fashion trends. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady baseline demand observed so far. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the OR backend's safety stock calculation z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) will target the median demand, while the pipeline + on-hand will be managed against the lead-time window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand stable around mean of 150 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a women's blouse, which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Based on 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude' messages, the actual lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods (as promised). Demand over the last 6 periods has been relatively stable with samples: 113, 144, 174, 150, 168, 118. The mean of these 6 samples is 144.5. Stockouts occurred in Periods 1-4 because lead time is 4, so we must rely on the pipeline. Currently, on-hand is 48 and in-transit is 575 (representing orders from periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). We will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (excluding the earliest sample) to capture the current demand level, which aligns with recent performance. Lead time is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Gyda blouse) continues to show stable demand and reliable lead times. From the conclude messages for periods 5, 6, and 7, we have confirmed that the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (matching the promised lead time). The demand samples (including pre-game and the 7 concluded periods) show a mean demand of approximately 144 units with relatively consistent variance. Current on-hand inventory is low (27 units), but significant in-transit inventory (546 units) exists from orders placed in Periods 4-7. The OR engine needs to set a base stock that covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Given the stability, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the start of the simulation period, and use the default lead time which aligns with observations.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a Gyda blouse (Womens Tailoring). Analysis of historical demand shows: P1-P5 mean ~150, P6-P7 mean ~150, but Period 8 experienced a significant spike to 220 units. This is likely driven by the change of season (spring) and approaching Easter preparations. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as seen in the last 4 concluded arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). To prevent stockouts during this potential spring demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (avg ~173) and projecting that forward for the L+1 cycle. sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to account for the Period 8 spike. Lead time is set to calculate as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 8 (220 units), possibly signaling a seasonal shift toward spring/holiday demand for blouses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The 'Gyda blouse' is likely experiencing a seasonal spring uplift. Mean demand over the last 9 weeks is approximately 156 units, but recent weeks (P7: 181, P8: 220) suggest higher spikes, followed by a stockout-capped demand of 142 in P9. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to high demand exceeding a small P5 shipment (31 units). There is a significant pipeline (733 units), including large orders from P6 (190), P7 (131), P8 (176), and P9 (236). Since lead time is 4, the P6 order (190 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 10 and be visible in Period 11. To ensure we capture the spring demand trend without over-ordering given the heavy pipeline, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean of 164.2 units (average of 168, 118, 181, 220, 142), which covers 5 periods of demand (1+L). The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P6. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 146 units over the last 10 periods, with a notable spike in P8 (220 units) that hasn't been sustained, though standard deviation has increased. Given the product is a blouse and we are moving deeper into spring, I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher and more volatile demand observed in the last 5 periods (mean ~155). On-hand inventory is 74 with 639 units in-transit (orders from P7-P10), ensuring we cover upcoming demand once they arrive. I will set L to calculate to reflect the stable 4-period lead time and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for recent spring demand fluctuations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we observe stable demand following a brief spike in early April. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is approximately 150 units (220, 142, 116, 121), which aligns with the historical pre-spike mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand (84) plus in-transit (572) equals 656 units. With an expected demand of 150/period, 5 periods of demand is ~750. However, the pipeline is already quite high relative to recent demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-April spike; mean demand returned to approximately 150 units over P9-P11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We have observed a stable lead time of 4 periods consistently (P5-P12). Demand analysis shows that after a temporary spike to 220 in Period 8 (early April), demand has settled into a lower range. Over the last three periods (P10-P12), demand was 116, 121, and 157, averaging approximately 131 units. The carry-over insight from Period 12 noted a stabilization around 150, but recent samples suggest it may be slightly lower. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture this post-spike stabilization while maintaining a buffer for the slightly higher Period 12 demand. This translates to an L of 4 (promised and actual), and a mu_hat based on the last 5 weeks of demand history to balance the inventory against the current 103 on-hand and 489 in-transit units. High volatility (standard deviation) is accounted for by using recent_N for sigma_hat as well.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. The 'Gyda blouse' experienced a peak in early April (Period 8 demand = 220) but has since stabilized. The last three periods (P11-P13) show demand of 121, 157, and 138, averaging 138.7 units. This supports the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 12 that demand has returned to a base level (approx 140-150 range). Lead time is consistently 4 periods per historical arrivals. With high current on-hand (201) and significant pipeline (417), the goal is to prevent overstocking. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 132.8) to capture the post-peak stabilization. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility and ensure L is set to calculate (confirming the observed 4-period lead time).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, we saw a demand spike in early April (Period 8: 220 units), but demand has since stabilized. The last three periods (P12-P14) show demands of 157, 138, and 170 units, averaging 155 units. This confirms the carry-over insight that demand returned to a mean of approximately 150-160 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P10 arrived in P14). On-hand inventory is healthy at 127 units with 377 units in-transit. Given the stability over the last 5 samples since the April spike, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike regime while maintaining responsiveness to the slight increase in mean demand compared to the early periods. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 12, demand has shown some volatility but has generally stayed within the 120-185 range, with an average of approximately 154 units over the last 5 weeks (P11-P15). There was a slight upward trend in the last two weeks (170 and 185 units). Given that L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) captures the recent stabilization and slight upward trend, while recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) correctly accounts for the current level of volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently high (492 units), which will moderate the order amount provided by the OR backend, helping to prevent overstocking given the current on-hand inventory of 6 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for P11-P15 shifted slightly higher to ~154 units compared to the post-spike baseline of 150 identified in Period 12.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17 (2019/06/03). The demand for this blouse has shown some variability but generally centers around a mean of 150-160 units. Recent demand (P11-P16) has been: 121, 157, 138, 170, 185, 117. The mean of these 6 samples is 148. The most recent period (P16) saw a stockout because the arrived quantity (93 units) was insufficient to meet the demand (117 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory stands at 595 units, covering orders from P13 (164), P14 (56), P15 (179), and P16 (196). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk and the 'equal' weight of profit and holding cost (both $1.0), the backend's target service level will be 50%. However, I want to ensure we recover from the current stockout and maintain availability during the early summer season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 148 units/period) and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is consistently observed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for the Gyda blouse has shown relative stability with occasional fluctuations. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 128 units, which is lower than the previous regime of ~154 units. In the most recent period (P17), demand dropped to 100 units. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P13 through P17). Currently, there are 64 units on hand and 576 units in transit (ordered in P14, P15, P16, and P17). Because the pipeline inventory (576) already significantly exceeds the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1=5, 5 * 128 = 640), the base stock calculation might trigger small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs, especially given the recent lower demand. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the modern demand average (approx 128) and use the calculate method for lead time as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) slowed to ~128 units, down from the ~154 units observed in P11-P15.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for the Gyda blouse has shown a noticeable downward trend over the last 5-6 weeks. Specifically, from Period 13 to Period 18, demand has averaged 116.2 units, a significant drop from the ~150-154 average seen in earlier periods. The latest three periods (P16-P18) show an even lower average of 101.3 units, suggesting a cooling interest as summer progresses. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P14 arriving in P18). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). Given the sustained demand drop over the last 6 weeks, I will use recent_N with N=6 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current lower-demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: 6-period average (P13-P18) dropped to 116 units, down from the previous baseline of ~150 units. Last 3 periods (P16-P18) average 101 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has entered a clear downward trend (regime shift) as we move into late June. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 95.75 units (117, 100, 87, 79), signaling a steady decline from the mid-year average of ~150 units. This decline is likely driven by the transition from spring to summer retail cycles. Consequently, mu_hat must be adjusted to reflect this lower demand regime to prevent overstacking inventory, especially since on-hand (133) plus in-transit (453) is high relative to these recent demand figures. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this specific downward trend. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P15 order arrived in P19). Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=4 to match the current volatility of this declining regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: average demand for P16-P19 dropped to ~96 units, continuing a week-over-week downward trend from the previous baseline of ~150 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant and sustained downward trend: P16 (117), P17 (100), P18 (87), P19 (79), and P20 (49). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 86 units, which is a sharp decline from the previous 150-unit baseline. This likely reflects summer seasonality for a long-sleeved 'Gyda blouse'. We are currently holding 280 units on-hand with another 257 in-transit (orders from P17-P19), while holding cost equals profit ($1/unit). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using the recent 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will adjust to this lower demand regime. The high on-hand and in-transit inventory relative to the 49 units of demand last period suggests we are significantly overstocked; the OR backend's inventory reconciliation (base_stock - on-hand - in-transit) will naturally zero out the order to avoid further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline intensified at Period 20: 5-period average (P16-P20) is 86 units, with P20 demand hitting a low of 49 units (down ~67% from the baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-297.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has entered a sustained decline as of July (Period 22), with the most recent demand observation at 64 units and the average of the last five periods (P17-P21) being approximately 76 units. This is a significant drop from the spring peak and the earlier baseline of ~150. Current inventory levels are very high: On-hand inventory is 361 units and there are 112 units in-transit (P18 order of 70 and P19 order of 42), totaling 473 units. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is penalized heavily. At the current demand rate (~76 units/period), the existing inventory covers over 6 periods, which is well beyond the 5-period cycle (L+1). Consequently, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower demand regime and allow the OR engine to pause ordering until inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at low level: 5-period average (P17-P21) dropped to ~76 units, with Period 20 hitting 49 units. Inventory is currently sufficient for 6+ periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has significantly declined since Period 17 (early June), with the most recent 5-period average (P18-P22) at approximately 66.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~150. Specifically, demand in the last three periods has settled around 50-60 units (P20: 49, P21: 64, P22: 55). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 376 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 5 periods of demand. With 42 units still in-transit (ordered P19, expected to arrive Period 23/24), the total inventory position is over 400 units. To minimize holding costs while demand is in this low regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~67 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting these parameters will result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: last 3 periods (P20-P22) average 56 units, confirming a sustained drop from the 150+ unit baseline seen in Spring.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has stabilized at a lower level following a significant decline in June/July. The last four periods (P20-P23) show demand values of 49, 64, 55, and 78, averaging approximately 61.5 units per week. This represents a distinct shift from the earlier baseline of ~150 units. With 340 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, the current inventory is enough to cover approximately 5.5 periods of demand at the new rate, which exceeds the lead-time coverage required. I am setting L to the prometed lead time of 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this new low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while carrying high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at low level (Summer baseline): Average demand for P20-P23 settled at ~62 units, down from the previous ~150 unit baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has stabilized at a significantly lower summer baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 59 units (49, 64, 55, 78, 47). Current on-hand inventory is 293 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods (L=4), the inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. At the current average of ~59 units/period, we require approximately 295 units. Since we have 293 units on-hand, we are perfectly positioned for the current demand regime. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this sustained low-demand period (approx 300 units for mu_hat). No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend as current inventory meets the base stock levels for this low-demand phase, avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline stable: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 58.6 units, confirming the shift from the spring baseline (~150).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has stabilized at a significantly lower summer baseline. For Period 25, the demand was 58 units, and the average over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is 58.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 235 units, which provides approximately 4 periods of coverage at the current demand rate (235 / 58.5 \u2248 4.01). Since the lead time is 4 periods, order+on-hand should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. However, with holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), it is critical to avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase. I will continue to use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current stable summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will result in a base stock level that targets roughly 5 periods of demand, likely triggering a small or zero order given the high existing inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand for the Gyda blouse showed a clear 'Summer' baseline of approximately 50-60 units per period from Period 20 through Period 25. However, Period 26 saw a significant jump to 127 units. This likely signals the start of a 'Late Summer/Pre-Fall' shopping transition or a new seasonal pattern as we move out of the mid-summer low. The carry-over insights previously identified a stable summer mean of ~58 units, but given the 120% increase in the most recent period, I will transition mu_hat to a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture this potential upward movement while still acknowledging the recent low-demand history. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (108) plus in-transit (58) equals 166 units, which covers approximately 2-3 periods of this new higher demand level. Since lead time is 4, we must continue to monitor if the Period 26 demand is a transient spike or a sustained shift.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand shift at Period 26: demand increased to 127 units from a previous 5-period average of ~59 units (+115%). Monitor for sustained trend.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has shifted again. After a summer low (avg ~60 units), the last two periods (P26-P27) have seen a significant increase to 127 and 116 units, likely due to late summer/early autumn transition or back-to-school season. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this elevated demand state (mean ~121.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 194 units in transit (58 from P26 and 136 from P27). Since L=4, the P26 order arrives in P30 and the P27 order in P31. I need to ensure new orders are placed to cover demand between now and P32. Using the recent elevated demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat will trigger the OR backend to place an order to rebuild the pipeline, as current in-transit inventory only covers about 1.6 periods of the new demand level (194 / 121.5).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 26: demand increased from ~60 units to an average of 121.5 units (+100%) over P26-P27, signaling the end of the summer low.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blouse SKU 695632002 has transitioned out of the summer low (~60 units) and has shifted to a higher regime since Period 26. Historical samples for this period in 2019 (Jan/Feb) were around 130-150 units. While Period 28 saw a dip to 76 units, periods 26 and 27 averaged 121.5 units, suggesting a new baseline is forming as we move towards autumn. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of this new regime (P26: 127, P27: 116, P28: 76 = ~106.3 units/period), which provides a balanced forecast for the upcoming lead time. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 329 units in transit (ordered in P26, P27, P28). Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient stock level for the (L+1) horizon during this recovery phase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has shifted again. Following a summer low (~60 units/period), demand increased starting in Period 26. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand of 127, 116, 76, and 86. While lower than the initial spring baseline of 150, the average over the last 4 periods is approximately 101 units, signaling a transition into the autumn retail season. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 480 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P19 all arrived with L=4). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new autumn regime (~101 units/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility (std dev of P26-P29 is approx 24.5). This approach ensures we replenishment at a rate matching current sales while awaiting the pipeline arrivals (P26 order of 58 is expected in P30, P27 order of 136 in P31).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand increased from summer levels (~60) to an average of ~101 units over P26-P29 (+68%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has shifted into an Autumn regime starting around Period 26 (date: 2019/8/5). Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 102.6 units (127, 116, 76, 86, 108), which is a significant increase from the summer low of ~60 units. We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) as the high demand depleted the summer safety stock faster than new orders arrived. While 'in-transit' is 449 units, the arrival of Period 27's order (136 units) is only expected in Period 31 (current period) and will not be visible for decision-making until Period 32. To recover and support this new regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the shift from Period 26) to reflect the mean of ~103 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 30 arrival of the Period 26 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has shifted into an Autumn regime starting around Period 26 (August). Recent demand samples (P26-P31) are 127, 116, 76, 86, 108, 154. The average of these last 6 periods is approximately 111.16 units. However, the last two periods (108, 154) suggest the regime is strengthening as we move deeper into September. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this Autumn shift while smoothing the variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 377 units in-transit (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). With a lead time of 4 periods, the P28 order (135 units) is expected to arrive during Period 32. Profit equals holding cost ($1.00), meaning the OR target service level is 50%. The current in-transit (377) plus the order generated by these parameters must cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the rising trend, I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the higher mean and volatility of the current Autumn season compared to the Summer low.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from summer levels (~60) to ~111 units over P26-P31 (+85%), with recent peaks reaching 154 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P32) confirms an Autumn regime shift, with demand rising from summer lows (~60) to an average of ~117 units over the last 7 periods, and peaking at ~153 units in the last two weeks. In-transit inventory includes orders from P29 (151), P30 (27), P31 (64), and P32 (158), totaling 400 units. The order from P29 is expected to arrive in Period 33, but hasn't arrived yet according to the Period 32 conclusion. On-hand is currently 0. Given the high demand and potential for stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this new elevated regime while excluding summer lows. Sigma_hat is also set to N=7 to reflect the increased volatility of the shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at Period 32: Average demand for P26-P32 is 117 units, with the last 2 weeks (P31-P32) averaging 153.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has experienced a significant surge, hitting a peak of 290 units in Period 33, which is a substantial increase from the 153.5 unit average observed in the preceding two periods. This likely reflects a seasonal autumn peak. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has been stock-out constrained for the last four periods (selling only what arrives). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the rise from Period 29-33 (86, 108, 154, 153, 290), resulting in an average of 158.2. Multiplying by (1 + L=4) gives a mu_hat of ~791. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase. This strategy aims to build enough pipeline inventory to meet the elevated autumn demand and recover from the persistent stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 290 units, pushing the 3-period average (P31-P33) to 199 units, a 70% increase over the early Autumn baseline (~117 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the product is in a high-demand autumn phase. The most recent demand (P33-P34) averaged 241 units, which is a significant increase from the early autumn baseline (~117 units). This likely corresponds to a seasonal peak for blouses in October. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and although there are 678 units in-transit, demand is consistently outstripping supply, leading to lost sales. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3: P32-P34) which average 211.67 units, giving a 5-period base stock (L+1) centered around this higher regime. I use N=3 to capture the most recent surge while acknowledging the extreme 290-unit peak might be an outlier compared to the 192-unit follow-up. This should signal the OR backend to increase order sizes to meet this new demand level without over-correcting for a single spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P32-P34 demand average is 211.7 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline. Anticipating a potentially sustained peak throughout October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime for the Gyda blouse. Demand since Period 33 has surged, with samples of 290, 192, and 177 units. The 3rd-period average (P33-P35) is approximately 220 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and while in-transit (942 units) is substantial, the current demand levels (averaging ~220 units) require a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). 5 periods * 220 units = 1100 units. My current pipeline (942) is slightly below this, so additional ordering is necessary to prevent stockouts 4 weeks from now. I will use the recent 4 samples (P32-P35) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the recent jump while respecting the volatile nature of the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: average demand for P32-P35 is 203 units, characterized by high volatility (SD \u2248 60) and a significant increase over early Autumn levels (~117). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 37 (Late October), and the Autumn demand regime is well-established. Over the last 5 periods (P32-P36), demand has averaged 191 units (153, 290, 192, 177, 145), though it showed a slight dip in the most recent observation. Given the product is a 'Gyda blouse' with long sleeves, we are likely in a seasonal peak. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (13), but pipeline inventory is high (857), representing orders placed during the high-demand surge. To ensure we cover demand across the next 5 periods (L+1) while accounting for the high volatility (SD \u2248 58) observed in the recent peak, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the current high-demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the Autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand peak (P32-P36) average established at 191 units with high volatility (SD \u2248 58).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Autumn regime (late October). Historical demand from Period 32 to 37 has averaged 192.8 units with significant weekly fluctuations (ranging from 145 to 290). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods per observed 'conclude' messages. Although the most recent demand was 200, the stockouts in 6 of the last 8 periods indicate we are likely under-estimating the true demand potential during this peak. Period 38 (Oct 28) precedes early November where demand might begin to normalize or shift toward holiday patterns. Given 'Profit/unit = $1.0' and 'Holding/unit/period = $1.0', the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we should aim to satisfy approximately the median demand. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current regime (P32-P37) which averages ~193, resulting in (1+L)*193 = 965. Sigma_hat is set to N=6 to reflect the high volatility (SD \u2248 48) observed in this period, providing a buffer against recent spikes (like the 290 units in P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-10-28 was 163 units, which is a decrease from the peak demand of 290 units (P33) and the high volatility seen in early October. However, the last 5 periods (P34-P38) maintain an average of 175.4 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for Autumn/Winter compared to the summer low. The product is a blouse, which typically sees steady demand in the lead-up to the holiday season. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 126 and a large pipeline of 676 units (mostly from high orders in P34-P35), we are currently well-covered for the next several periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current autumn demand level, which helps the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for recent mean demand and standard deviation without over-ordering based on the single P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P34-P38) average demand is 175.4 units, showing a slight decrease and stabilization compared to the previous peak average (191 units in P32-P36).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-184.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has shown a slight downward trend and stabilization over the last four periods (P36-P39: 145, 200, 163, 135), moving away from the earlier October peak of 290 units. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods is 160.75 units, compared to the previously observed autumn peak average of 191 units. Current on-hand inventory is 319 units, with 423 units in-transit (P36: 73, P37: 87, P38: 188, P39: 75). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent demand data (N=4) reflects the slight cooling from the peak. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 provides a baseline of approx 161 * 5 = 805 units. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 742 units, suggesting a relatively small order is needed to maintain service levels while accounting for the recent deceleration. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Mean demand for P36-P39 has settled at 160.75 units, indicating a cooling from the late-October peak (~191) but remaining significantly higher than early Autumn levels (~117).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized from the late-October peak (~191) to a more moderate Autumn baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand units were 145, 200, 163, 135, and 166, resulting in a mean of 161.8. This regime is significantly higher than early Autumn (~117) but lower than the surge seen in Period 33. On-hand inventory is 226 units, and pipeline inventory is 412 units (consisting of orders from P37-P40). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. To respond to this stabilized demand and the observed volatility (SD \u2248 24 for the last 5 periods), I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-October peak: Average demand for P36-P40 is 161.8 units, down from the P32-P36 peak of 191 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized after the October peak, with the last 6 periods (P36-P41) averaging 162 units. The volatility in this post-peak period has decreased (SD \u2248 22) compared to the October surge. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 149 and in-transit at 496, we have a total pipeline of 645 units. Given the target base stock is approximately (L+1)*mean (5 * 162 = 810), we need to continue ordering to maintain service levels while accounting for the lower volatility. I will use a recent_N of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-October peak: Average demand for P36-P41 is 162.2 units with reduced volatility (SD \u2248 22) compared to the October peak (SD \u2248 60).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike of 862 units, far exceeding the recent 'stabilized' mean of ~162 units. Given the date (2019/11/25), this clearly corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for the Gyda blouse. This spike exhausted all on-hand inventory. Looking forward to Period 43 (Dec 2), we are entering the holiday shopping season. Demand is expected to remain high and volatile compared to the November baseline, though likely not as extreme as the Black Friday peak. I will use an explicit forecast for demand (mu_hat) by setting it to a level roughly 25% higher than the pre-peak November mean (approx 200 units per period) to account for ongoing December gift-giving demand, while keeping volatility high to protect against stockouts during this critical period. On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 474 (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). The P39 order (75 units) is expected to arrive this period (P43).

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand reached 862 units, significantly impacting inventory levels. Transitioning to December holiday demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the post-Black Friday holiday demand regime (Date: 2019/12/9). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike of 862 units, resulting in a stockout. Period 43 demand was 227 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-peak baseline (~162) but lower than the spike, suggesting elevated December holiday demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 710 units (ordered in P40: 62, P41: 171, P42: 166, P43: 311). The P40 order (62 units) is expected to arrive this period (P44). To address the sustained high demand of the holiday season, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the transition and peaks) to capture the higher mean. Since volatility is high due to the spike, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to ensure the OR backend maintains a higher buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed at Period 43: Following the Black Friday spike (862 units), Period 43 demand reached 227 units, identifying a sustained December peak significantly above the Autumn baseline of 162 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16), in the midst of the holiday season. Recent demand history shows a massive Black Friday spike of 862 units in P42, followed by a sustained high-demand December regime (P43: 227 units, P44: 131 units). While demand dropped in P44 to 131, we remain in a potential peak period where late-December sales often increase before the January lull. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 1562 units. Notably, the order from P44 was for 914 units, likely to cover the depleted stock from the BF spike. Given that lead time is stable at 4 periods, these units won't arrive until P48. To set parameters for the OR backend: 1. Lead Time: 'default' (promised 4 periods is consistent with 'Period 44 conclude' showing an arrival from P40). 2. Demand (mu_hat): I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (P42-P44) to capture the current holiday regime mean, which is approx 406 units per period. This high mean will ensure the 'base_stock' calculation accounts for the extreme volatility observed recently. 3. Sigma_hat: I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the massive variance introduced by the 862-unit spike. This will raise the safety stock (z*\u03c3) to protect against stockouts during the final holiday weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: P42-P44 average demand is ~406 units due to Black Friday/December peak, characterized by extreme volatility (Max: 862, Min: 131).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas holiday season. The demand history shows a massive Black Friday spike (862 units) followed by sustained holiday demand (P43-P45 avg: 171.7 units). Period 45 demand was 157. Given the date, demand is expected to remain high through the New Year before tapering in January. The inventory position is tight: 14 units on-hand with significant in-transit (1863 units), much of which came from a massive order in P44 (914 units) to restock after the Black Friday stockout. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the 914-unit order from P44 won't arrive until P48 conclude (visible P49), we must maintain high parameters to cover the remaining holiday peak. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-Black Friday holiday mean (~170) while sigma_hat is set to default (entire history) to account for the extreme volatility observed during this Q4 period, allowing the z-score to provide a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which marks the end of the holiday season and the beginning of the post-holiday/January clearance period. Reviewing recent demand: P42 (Black Friday): 862, P43: 227, P44: 131, P45: 157, P46: 83. After the extreme holiday peaks, demand has sharply decelerated to double digits in the most recent period. Total pipeline inventory is very high at 1,697 units (primarily from massive orders in P44 and P45), while on-hand is 97. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, these large orders (914 units from P44 and 472 units from P45) will arrive in P48 and P49 respectively. This creates a risk of significant overstocking as we move into a typically slower January period. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (P43-P46) to capture the post-spike cooling trend (mean ~150) and allow the pipeline to satisfy future demand without additional ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: Demand dropped to 83 units in P46 following the Dec peak, indicating a transition to the January low season. Pipeline currently holds 1,697 units.
