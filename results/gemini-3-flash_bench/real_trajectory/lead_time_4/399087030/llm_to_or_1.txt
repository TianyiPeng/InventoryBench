Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399087030 (Ladies Super-skinny denim). Historical demand samples from January to early February show a mean of approximately 111 units per week (110, 102, 105, 123, 115). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, though the last two samples show a slight upward trend. Promised lead time is 4. Since there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand level and volatility seen in the historical data without being overly sensitive to single outliers.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket low-rise jeans'. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the period 1 order (125 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since there are only 5 historical demand samples (range 102-123) and 1 period of gameplay (demand 130), the average weekly demand is approximately 115.8. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand. Total expected demand over 5 weeks is approx 579. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level. I will use recent_N=6 to capture all available demand data (5 history + P1) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L will remain at the default (promised 4 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is early-season ladies' denim. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of 111.0 and std of 8.2. However, recorded demand in Period 1 (130) and Period 2 (73) shows significant volatility (avg 101.5), likely due to post-winter transition or stockout artifacts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 257 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 arrival resolution phase (visible in Period 6 start). Because we have zero stock and have missed all demand so far (130 + 73 = 203 lost sales), we must maintain a robust pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend while including historical samples. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' as we haven't seen any completed arrivals to suggest the promised 4-period lead time is inaccurate.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The initial demand samples (early Feb) averaged 112.6, but the actual realized demand in periods 1-3 has dropped significantly (avg 94.0). Specifically, P2 and P3 saw demands of 73 and 79, suggesting a post-season slowdown or a regime shift compared to the initial training data. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to account for this lower demand level. Promised lead time is 4 periods; as we are only at Period 4, the first order (placed P1) is not expected to arrive until the end of this period (visible in Period 5). Consequently, on-hand remains 0, and all current demand is being lost. The pipeline (403 units) covers the orders from P1, P2, and P3. L is kept at default (4) as no actual lead time data is confirmed yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket super-skinny jeans'. Historical demand (pre-game) averaged 110.8, but observed demand in Periods 1-4 has dropped to an average of 91 (130, 73, 79, 82). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 549 (sum of orders from P1-P4: 125+132+146+146=549). Since we are in the decision phase of P5 and P1's order is not 'late' yet (it arrives *during* P5), I will maintain the default lead time. For demand, the initial P1 spike (130) likely reflected unmet need, while P2-P4 (73, 79, 82) show a more stable current regime. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume (~78 units/period) to avoid over-ordering while waiting for shipments to clear the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in this recent stable period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a ladies' denim item. Historical demand from the provided samples and game history (Periods 1-5) shows a mean of approximately 100 units/period (110, 102, 105, 123, 115, 130, 73, 79, 82, 91). Specifically, recent demand in the game history (starting P2) has settled into a lower range (~85 units/period) compared to the initial samples. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). On-hand inventory is low (34 units), while 424 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4), with the P2 order (132 units) expected to arrive during the current period (P6). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using all 10 available samples (history + provided) gives a stable mean (~101) and standard deviation (~18). I will use N=10 for mu and sigma to capture this full context while the system waits for the large pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 order arrived P5). Initial demand regime since P1 start (Feb-Mar) averages ~91 units/period, slightly lower than pre-game samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a staple item (Super Skinny Ladies Denim). Historical demand since the start of the simulation (Periods 1-6) shows an average of ~88.3 units per period (130, 73, 79, 82, 91, 75), which is lower than the pre-game samples (~110). Excluding the outlier Period 1 (130), the recent regime (last 5 periods) averages 80 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand (91) and in-transit (410) are sufficient to cover expected demand over the next lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect observed performance. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable demand regime seen since Period 2. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev ~7) rather than including the initial period's spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1). The product is 'Super Skinny Low Rise Jeans', which generally sees stable demand, but Period 7 showed a massive spike to 211 units, up from an average of ~91. This spike likely reflects a spring-season transition or a specific promotion. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (26 units) while 264 units are in-transit (orders from P4 and P6). Given the L=4 and the recent surge, we must account for both the increased mean demand and the higher volatility. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent jump (averaging ~125.6 units/period across P5-P7) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the P7 outlier. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in P7 (211 units), signaling a potential shift to high-season spring demand compared to the Feb-Mar average of ~91. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing the demand history: pre-game samples averaged 111. Feb-Mar (P1-P6) averaged ~91. P7 saw a sharp spike to 211, followed by P8 at 88. This volatility suggests the start of spring/Easter seasonality for 'Ladies Denim', often characterized by intermittent high-demand weeks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift that started in P5-P8 (Avg: 116.25). Using a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat better reflects the increased variance and the P7 spike than the lifetime average. L is set to default (4) as it aligns with observations. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly higher volatility observed since the P7 spike.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonality/volatility confirmed: Demand shifted from low-stable (~80-90) in Feb/Mar to high-volatile in Apr (P7: 211, P8: 88).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (April 15). Demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) has been highly volatile (211, 88, 57), characteristic of a spring transition for ladies' denim. The average demand since P7 is 118.7 units, compared to the earlier regime average of ~91. In Period 9, no arrival was recorded (ordered on P5, which was 0 units), confirming the promised lead time of 4 holds (orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (27 units), and the pipeline is 587 units (from P6, P8, P9). Since we expect the P6 order (118 units) to arrive in Period 10, the immediate inventory pressure is managed. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatile spring demand pattern (P7-P9) to ensure the OR backend captures the higher mean and significantly increased variance observed recently.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10 (P5 missing an arrival matches the order skip in P5). Currently, we have 104 units on-hand and 722 in-transit. The demand history shows a very high-variance period in April: P7 (211), P8 (88), P9 (57), P10 (41). This follows a stable Feb-Mar period (~91 units). The recent drops (57, 41) suggest the 'spring spike' seen in P7 may be an outlier or part of a very high-volatility regime. Given the product (Super Skinny Ladies Denim), spring is usually a transition period. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture this recent volatile average (~99 units) and a longer window for sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the massive variance spike in P7 (211 vs 41). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased in April (P7-P10), with weekly demand ranging from 211 to 41 units, compared to the stable ~91 avg in Feb-Mar.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Jeans'. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable period in Feb-Mar (~91 units/period) followed by high volatility in April (Period 7: 211, Period 8: 88, Period 9: 57, Period 10: 41, Period 11: 105). The recent average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 100.4 units, but the high variance indicates we must protect against spikes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). However, the order from Period 5 is missing (it should have arrived in P9, but conclude shows arrived=0, and it is now 3 periods late). This confirms a lost shipment or severe delay. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 722 units (comprising orders from P8, P9, and P10). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the game state shows 4-period arrivals are standard, I will use L=4. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 (covering the volatile April period) to capture the current mean of ~100. The OR backend will scale this to (1+L)*100 = 500 units for the base stock. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the recent high volatility, ensuring a higher safety stock to compensate for the lost shipment and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: P12: Lost shipment confirmed for Period 5 order (should have arrived P9). Demand remains volatile in April/May transition, averaging ~100 over the last 5 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/06 (Period 13). We are in the May demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged ~69 units, a drop from the volatile April peaks. However, the last 4 periods (P9-P12) average ~65 units. The lost shipment from Period 5 (missing P9) created a supply gap that was partially filled by the arrival of the P8 order (248 units) in P12. We currently have 192 units on-hand and 500 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and P12). The P9 order (221 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P13 resolution) as observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for the current demand environment which has stabilized at a lower level than the extreme April spike but remains higher than the early Feb troughs. I will use N=5 for demand (covering the shift from early April to early May) to capture a representative mean and volatility for the upcoming 5-week horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization: Demand has moderated after April volatility, averaging 65-70 units over P8-P12. Supply chain recovery in progress following P5 lost shipment.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 (May 13). Recent demand history indicates that after a volatile April (P7-P11), demand has stabilized at a lower level in May (P12: 56, P13: 49). The current average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 62 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P12 and P13), with the exception of the lost shipment from P5. On-hand inventory is 364, and in-transit is 279 (consisting of the P10 order of 253 and P12 order of 26). The total pipeline plus on-hand (643) is sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), even if demand averages 100 per period. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stabilization in demand and calculate for lead time to maintain the 4-period baseline. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) will account for the reduced volatility observed in the last few weeks compared to the mid-April peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We have high on-hand inventory (546 units) due to large orders placed during the April volatility (Periods 8-10) arriving now. Demand has settled into a lower, more stable regime in late April and May, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 64.4 units. Since the lead time (L=4) plus current period requires us to cover 5 periods of demand, and on-hand+in-transit (546 + 26 = 572) already far exceeds the expected demand for this window (approx 5 * 65 = 325), the OR backend should minimize further orders. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this moderating May trend. This will result in a zero or near-zero order, allowing existing inventory to deplete and reducing future holding costs.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (P10-P14) stabilized significantly at a lower average of ~64 units compared to the chaotic April (P7-P11). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods post-P5 loss.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27) finds the system with a high on-hand inventory of 505 units and only 26 units in transit. The recent 'May regime' (P10-P15) shows a stable, lower demand average of approximately 61 units per period (sample: 41, 105, 56, 49, 71, 41), significantly lower than the volatile April peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the standard observation for successful deliveries. Given the current high stock level (505 units), which covers roughly 8 periods of demand at current rates, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or very low orders to minimize holding costs. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stabilized May demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility in this period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. Demand has entered a low-volume phase since mid-May (P14-P16 demand: 71, 41, 22), averaging approximately 45 units over the last 3 periods, down from the May average of ~64. We are currently overstocked with 509 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. This stock represents over 10 periods of supply at current demand rates. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on recent deliveries (P12 order arrived P16). To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend using recent_N (N=5 covers the shift through May and early June) and keep L at default (4 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the reduction in volatility observed since the chaotic April period.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand regime shift: Demand has dropped significantly in late May/early June (P15-P16 avg: 31.5) compared to the mid-May average (~64).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 (Ladies Denim Jeans) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Since Period 15 (late May/early June), demand has consistently dropped, with the last three periods recording 41, 22, and 20 units respectively. The average demand over the last four periods (P14-P17) is approximately 38.5 units. We are currently holding a significant surplus of 489 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which at current demand levels covers over 12 weeks of sales. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods for all successfully delivered orders. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (~95%), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent low-demand regime and high volatility from the transition. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the high current inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at low levels: Late May to early June (P15-P17) shows a significant decrease to an average of ~27.7 units/period, down from the mid-May average of ~64. Pipeline inventory is currently empty and the system is overstocked with 12+ weeks of supply.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19 (mid-June). The demand has entered a sustained low-level regime starting around Period 15. The demand for the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 41, 22, 20, and 45, averaging approximately 32 units per period. This is a significant drop from the May average (~64) and the April volatility. We currently have an inventory of 444 units and zero units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~32, we have nearly 14 weeks of supply on hand, which far exceeds the lead-time requirement (L=4). To prevent further accumulation of expensive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4-period regime (N=4) to accurately reflect this drop in demand. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + pipeline) >> base_stock and will correctly place zero orders. No new patterns are detected beyond the stabilization of this low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains Critical Overstock. Current on-hand inventory is 425 units, while the recent demand regime (P15-P19) has averaged only 29.4 units per period. At this consumption rate, existing stock covers approximately 14 weeks of demand. Period 19 demand was very low at 19 units, confirming the 'low-level' stabilization noted in recent insights. There is no in-transit pipeline. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and to stop the OR backend from placing any new orders, I will continue to signal the lowest possible demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the most recent low-demand window (N=5). This ensures the base stock calculation remains significantly below the current on-hand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a sustained low period: P15-P19 average is 29.4 units, representing a >50% drop from the mid-May average (~64).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. The demand average from Period 15 to Period 20 is approximately 26.5 units per period, down from over 100 in the early weeks and ~64 in mid-May. Currently, on-hand inventory is 413 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, this represents over 15 weeks of supply, far exceeding the coverage needed for the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (5 weeks total). This overstock is likely a result of orders placed during the volatile April period. Given the current date (July 1st), we are entering the summer season where demand for 'superstretch denim trousers' may remain low or continue to be stable at these reduced levels. My strategy is to set parameters that prevent new orders until the inventory level drops naturally. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this recent low-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The current excess inventory will correctly lead to a zero order to minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low summer levels: P15-P20 average is 26.5 units/period, down from the June average of 29.4 units and significantly lower than the May regime (~64).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained low-demand period that began in mid-May. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P15-P21) is 26.1 units per period, showing high stability at this lower level (stdev approx 11.8). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 389 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering 5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate of ~26 units/period, the needed inventory is approximately 130 units. Since current on-hand (389) is nearly 15 times the weekly demand, the system is significantly overstocked. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=7) to allow the OR controller to burn through existing stock without placing new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Low summer demand regime remains stable: P15-P21 average is 26.1 units/period, indicating consistent low demand since late May.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The demand for product 399087030 (ladies' skinny jeans) has remained in a low summer regime since late May (Period 15). Over the last 8 periods (P15-P22), demand has averaged 24.38 units per period, which is significantly lower than the springtime peak and the May stabilization levels. In Period 22, demand was only 12 units. Current inventory on-hand is 377 units with zero units in transit. Given the current demand average of ~24 units, the on-hand stock covers approximately 15 periods of demand, which is far beyond the (L+1) target of 5 periods (base stock approximately 125-150 units). Therefore, no new orders are required. To reflect this low-demand state and prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders, I will set mu_hat to a recent_N of 8 to capture the low summer regime (P15 onwards) and sigma_hat to recent_N 8 to reflect the reduced volatility in this period. Lead time (L) remains calculated at the observed average of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low summer demand regime (P15-P22) reflects a sustained average of ~24.4 units/period, confirming a long-term shift down from previous May levels (~64).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product (Super-skinny Ladies Denim) is in a sustained low-demand summer regime. Since Period 15 (late May), demand has averaged approximately 22.9 units per period (P15-P23: 41, 22, 20, 45, 19, 12, 24, 12, 12). On-hand inventory is 365 units with zero in-transit, providing over 15 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. Given the high stock level relative to demand and the $1.00/unit holding cost, the priority remains to deplete existing inventory without placing new orders. I will set mu_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=9) and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will naturally propose zero orders because the on-hand inventory far exceeds the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) calculated for a 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P15-P23) average has further stabilized to ~22.9 units/period, down from the June average of ~26.5.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is deep into the summer season for 'Ladies Denim Trousers'. The demand regime has consistently bottomed out, with the last five periods (P20-P24) averaging only 14 units per period (12, 24, 12, 12, 10). This represents a significant sustained low compared to the early summer average (~23). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 355 units, which covers over 25 weeks of supply at the current consumption rate. With no pipeline inventory and a lead time consistently observed at 4 periods, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the massive surplus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=10, covering P15-P24) where the average is approximately 21.6 units. This ensures the base stock calculation remains significantly below the current on-hand level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late summer demand (July) has dropped further to an ultra-low regime, averaging ~14 units/period over P20-P24, compared to the early summer average of ~26.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained ultra-low demand regime, typical for late summer (August) for heavyweight denim. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 15.6 units/period (24, 12, 12, 10, 20). My current on-hand inventory is 335 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, I have roughly 21 periods of supply on hand, which is far in excess of the lead time (4 periods). The primary objective is to avoid adding to the significant holding cost. I will set the demand parameters using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current low consumption and keep lead time at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. Since on-hand + in-transit (335) is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock calculation for 5 periods (e.g., 5 * ~16 = 80), the OR backend will correctly output an order of 0 units.

Carry-over insight: August demand remains in the ultra-low regime; P21-P25 average is 15.6 units/period, confirming the mid-to-late summer slump for this item.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained ultra-low demand regime, typical for late summer (August). Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 17.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 300 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers approximately 16-17 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (last 7 periods, P20-P26, avg ~17.9) to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders. Since the system is significantly overstocked, the priority is to avoid holding costs while maintaining a service level for the low residual demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: August demand (P22-P26) has stabilized at an ultra-low average of ~17.8 units/period, down from the early summer average (~26). On-hand inventory represents >15 weeks of cover.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained low-demand late-summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 21.8 units, and the broader summer regime (P15-P27) averages approximately 21.8 units. The current on-hand inventory of 268 units provides approximately 12 weeks of cover at these demand levels. Given the high stock levels and the need to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period), no new orders are necessary. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 to capture the absolute current demand level, while the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting the OR parameters based on the current low demand will ensure the backend keeps the order quantity at zero until inventory levels are naturally depleted.

Carry-over insight: August demand (P23-P27) is averaging ~21.8 units/period, maintaining the stable low-demand period observed throughout the summer.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to operate in a sustained low-demand summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 24.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 241 units, which provides approximately 9-10 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. There is no pipeline inventory, and none is needed given the significant overstock relative to demand. The target is to let on-hand inventory bleed down naturally to reduce holding costs. Parameters are set to match the recent 5-week demand statistics (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment, while lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained low-demand summer regime. Observations from the last 10 periods (P20-P29) show an average demand of approximately 20.7 units per period, with recent weeks (P25-P29) averaging 27 units. On-hand inventory is 220 units, which, at current demand levels, provides roughly 8-10 weeks of coverage. Since the lead time is 4 periods and we have significant excess stock, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand stable regime (Avg ~20.7, significantly lower than earlier in the year). L is set to 'default' as lead times have been stable at 4 periods since the P5 loss.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand remains in the low summer regime (P20-P29 avg: 20.7). Inventory levels remain high (>8 weeks cover), precluding the need for new orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU 399087030 (Ladies Denim) is continuing through a sustained low-demand regime typical of the post-summer/early-autumn transition. Demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) has averaged 22.5 units/period, with the most recent sample at 32. Current on-hand inventory is 188 units, which provides approximately 8.3 weeks of coverage (188 / 22.5). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target of 95% (q = 19/(19+1)), the current stock level is more than sufficient to cover the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, no new order is required. I will use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as there is no current pipeline to track or recent deviation from the promised 4-period lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this item (super-skinny denim) has been in a sustained low summer regime since late May, but showed a slight uptick in the last two periods (P30: 32, P31: 50). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is approximately 25 units. There is currently no pipeline inventory (in-transit = 0), and on-hand inventory is 138 units. At the recent average of 25 units/period, the current stock provides roughly 5.5 weeks of coverage. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory level, we are approaching the point where a new order might be triggered by the OR backend. However, because the item is currently overstocked relative to the summer regime, the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will effectively manage this. I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (approx. Since P20) to capture the stable low demand while acknowledging the very recent slight increase. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand showed a slight increase in P30-P31 (avg 41) compared to the late-summer average (avg ~21). Inventory levels are finally approaching a range where new orders may be needed within 1-2 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (P33). We are observing a sustained upward trend in demand following the summer slump. Demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) was 32, 50, and 60, respectively, showing a clear shift from the summer average of ~20 to a current September average of ~47. This suggests a transition into autumn demand. On-hand inventory is now 78, with 26 units in transit (expected in P36). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline coverage must account for demand through P37. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this current upward momentum (avg 47), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat reflects the increasing volatility of the seasonal transition. Lead time remains standard at 4 based on history (excluding the P5 loss). This configuration allows the OR backend to recalculate the safety stock and ordering needs for the approaching October season while accounting for the recent demand acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in September: Demand has increased from a summer average of ~21 to a Recent_3 average of 47.3 (P30-P32), signaling the start of the autumn season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn season, characterized by a significant demand surge (169 units in P33), which effectively cleared out the remaining safety stock and created a stockout (on-hand 0). This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified. The Recent_3 average (P31-P33) is now 93 units/period, but given the 169-unit spike in late September, I will use a conservative but elevated forecast to rebuild inventory. Order lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 97 (orders from P32 and P33), a significant order is needed to meet the (L+1) window of 5 periods. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 500 (100 units/period for 5 periods) and sigma_hat to 125 to account for high volatility seen in transitional periods, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level given the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: Demand surged to 169 in P33, ending the low summer regime. Late September average (~93) is significantly higher than the mid-summer average (~21).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October). The demand for ladies' denim has shifted from a low summer regime (~21 units/period) to a high autumn regime (P33: 169, P34: 152). This fits the profile of 'back-to-school' and autumn fashion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, sales are lost, and we have 289 units in transit (ordered in P32, P33, P34). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning the first delivery (26 units from P32) is expected to arrive in Period 36. To address the current stockout and the validated high demand regime, I will set the mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the start of the autumn spike P32-P34) which averages 127 units per period. Over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), this requires approximately 635 units of total coverage. With 289 units currently in transit, the OR backend will calculate a substantial order to close the gap. L is set to 4 based on historical arrival evidence.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Demand spiked significantly in late September (P33-P34 average: 160.5), compared to the summer average of ~21. This surge is likely sustained through October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn regime that started in late September (P33). Demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) has averaged 152.7 units (169, 152, 137). The product is 'Ladies Denim', which typically sees strong sustained demand in October. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the recent demand surge. We have 513 units in-transit: P32(26), P33(71), P34(192), and P35(224). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P32 order (26 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P36, followed by the others in sequence. To maintain the target service level during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current autumn regime (averaging ~152 units/period, scaled by 1+L). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this shift. We continue with the promised lead time of 4 periods as observed performance (excluding the P5 loss) remains consistent.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime, with demand averaging approximately 114 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Specifically, the surge began in late September (P33), and while it has slightly moderated from the peak of 169, it remain significantly higher than the summer baseline. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P32 order arrived in P36). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) while waiting for substantial pipeline shipments (667 units) to arrive starting next period (P37 conclude). To sustain availability during this high-demand period, mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent regime shift (N=5), and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the increased volatility seen in the autumn surge. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime sustained (P32-P36 avg: 114.2). Lead time stability at 4 periods reaffirmed by P32 arrival in P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained autumn high-demand regime (late September through October). Demand over the last five periods (P33-P37) has averaged 139.8 units, significantly higher than the summer average (~21). Although we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory, in-transit stock is 707 units. Specifically, orders from P34 (192 units), P35 (224 units), P36 (180 units), and P37 (111 units) are expected to arrive in P38, P39, P40, and P41 respectively, given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The arrivals in P38 (192 units) will immediately address the stockout. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the high-demand regime P33-P37) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current surge, and since demand volatility remains high, recent_N=5 for sigma_hat is also used. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $19 margin while recognizing the significant pipeline inventory already committed for the next 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand autumn regime confirmed (P33-P37): average demand is 139.8 units/period, showing recovery from summer lows. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P33-P38), demand has averaged 141.6 units per period, showing significant strength compared to the summer slump. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, with orders from P32, P33, and P34 arriving exactly as scheduled in P36, P37, and P38. On-hand inventory is currently low (41 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 604 units (ordered P35-P38) arriving over the next 4 periods. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we maintain a high service level. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to estimate 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to capture the sustained autumn demand levels while ignoring the previous low-demand summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime is sustained and stable: P33-P38 average is 141.6 units/period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand regime is firmly in the autumn high-demand season. The average demand from Period 33 to 38 is 141.6 units per period, with Period 39 showing a slight moderation at 109 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P32, P33, P34, and P35 arriving exactly in P36, P37, P38, and P39). On-hand inventory is 156, and in-transit is 532. We need to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use the last 7 periods (P33-P39) to define the current demand regime, as this period captures the full autumn surge. This ensures \u03bc_hat and \u03c3_hat reflect the higher levels and volatility seen since late September, preventing stockouts during this high-profit period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand autumn regime that began in late September (Period 33). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is approximately 131 units, significantly higher than the summer lows. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P36, P37, P38, P39, and P40). Pipeline inventory is healthy with 442 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), and on-hand inventory is 242 units. Given the transition into late November, demand is expected to remain robust. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (N=8), and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (N=8). This ensures the base stock target covers (L+1) periods of the 131-unit average demand (~655 units), while the current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 684) suggests only a small replenishment order is needed to maintain safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P33-P40) average demand is 131.1 units/period. Lead time stability at 4 periods confirmed by five consecutive prompt arrivals (P36-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087030 is currently in a sustained autumn/winter high-demand regime. We are at Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019). The demand from Period 33 to Period 41 has consistently averaged approximately 127 units per period. The most recent demand (P40, P41) has settled around 94 units, suggesting a potential slight cooling from the October peak, but still significantly higher than the summer lows. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive prompt arrivals (P36-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 259, with 408 units in transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in P42, P43, P44, and P45 respectively. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~127, total requirement is ~635 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 667, which is slightly above the requirement, but the OR backend's capped policy will manage the specific order quantity to maintain the target base stock. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime starting from Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3952.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand show a significant spike in Period 42 (215 units), which aligns with the Cyber Monday/Black Friday retail period (late November). This peak follows a stable autumn regime where demand averaged ~131 units (P33-P41). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, with the P38 order arriving exactly on time in P42. Given the seasonal context (early December), I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially retreat slightly from the Black Friday peak before the Christmas rush. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat captures the autumn high-demand regime while weighting the recent volatility. Setting sigma_hat with N=5 captures the increased variance from the recent spike to ensure sufficient safety stock for the lead time + review period (5 total periods of coverage).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed for late November (Period 42: 215 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P38 order arrived P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December period (P44). Recent history shows a stable lead time of 4 periods. The demand profile shifted significantly in late September (P33) to a high-autumn regime, with a recent major spike in P42 (215 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a moderation in P43 (82 units) as the peak passed. To capture this autumn/early winter regime while smoothing the single-period promotional spike, I am using a recent_N approach for demand. Specifically, with N=11 (spanning P33 to P43), we capture the entirety of the high-demand period since summer ended. The current average demand for this period (P33-P43) is 129.8 units. Lead time analysis shows the system is performing reliably at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P36 through P43. On-hand inventory is 203, and in-transit is 466 (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43). The pipeline is well-stocked, but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain mu_hat at levels that cover the high autumn/winter baseline to prevent stockouts during the Christmas/January sales transition.

Carry-over insight: December post-peak demand: Demand moderated to 82 units in P43 following the Black Friday spike (215 in P42). The autumn/winter high-demand regime (P33-P43) maintains a sustained average of ~130 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $767.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in the most recent period (P44) was 53 units, following a peak of 215 in P42 (Black Friday) and 82 in P43. This confirms a post-peak seasonal decline. The autumn/winter high-demand regime (P33-P44) has an average of ~124 units/period, but the last two periods (avg 67.5) suggest a significant cooling as we move towards year-end. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 240 units with 512 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44). Total pipeline + on-hand is 752 units. At a projected demand of ~70-100 units per week, we have over 7 weeks of coverage. Given there are only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), further orders will arrive too late to be sold (Lead Time 4 means a P45 order arrives in theArrival Resolution of Period 49). To maximize reward and minimize ending inventory holding costs, I will set parameters to prevent unnecessary new orders while maintaining a safety buffer for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: December post-peak regime: Demand has significantly declined post-Black Friday (P43-P44 avg: 67.5), signaling the end of the high-demand autumn/winter peak for this item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $863.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46). Demand has significantly slowed down following the late November peak (Black Friday). The last three periods (P43-P45) show demand of 82, 53, and 59, confirming a lower post-peak regime. The current on-hand inventory is 258, and there are 435 units in transit (ordered in P42, P43, and P44). Given the current demand average of ~65 units, we have nearly 4 periods of stock on hand and over 6 periods in transit, totaling over 10 periods of coverage. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have sufficient stock for the next few months at current demand levels, I will continue to set the order to 0 by maintaining high parameters relative to current demand but relying on the system's pipeline inventory check. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (avg ~65), effectively reducing the base stock target and preventing unnecessary ordering while the overstock clears.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak winter regime confirmed: Late Dec (P43-P45) average demand decreased to 64.7 units, significantly lower than the autumn/peak average (~130). Current inventory levels provide >10 weeks of coverage.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the end of December (Period 47). Historical data shows that demand for this item (Ladies Denim) drops significantly after the late November peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Over the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has averaged 57.75 units, a sharp decline from the autumn peak average of ~131. The most recent period (P46) showed demand of 37 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 298 units, and with 358 units still in transit, the total stock (656) covers more than 11 weeks of the recent average demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels and the transition into a lower-demand winter regime, I will use a recent_N (N=4) window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this post-peak moderation and prevent further overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak winter demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for P43-P46 is ~57.8 units, down from the autumn peak (~131). Inventory levels are currently high (>10 weeks cover).
