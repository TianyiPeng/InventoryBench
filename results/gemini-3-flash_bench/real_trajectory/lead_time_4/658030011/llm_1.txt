With on-hand 0 and in-transit 0, I am currently out of stock and need to cover the lag. d) Pipeline Assessment: Since my decision in Period 1 will arrive in Period 5 (L=4) and be usable for Period 6 demand, I need to account for demand spanning Periods 1 through 5 initially to build a buffer. e) Order Logic: To cover approximately 5-6 weeks of demand (L+1 or L+2) while establishing a safety stock due to the high variance (Std Dev ~25), I aim for a target inventory level around 500 units (85 units * 6 periods). Given I start at 0, an initial order of 500 units is appropriate to initialize the pipeline.",

Historically, retail demand can spike for Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late November) but then may taper off or shift towards holiday gift items. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 396 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of current demand (avg ~100 units). The pipeline has 250 units in transit: 150 from P37 (arriving P41), 0 from P38, 50 from P39 (arriving P43), and 50 from P40 (arriving P44). Total inventory + pipeline = 646 units. With 7 periods remaining in the game, and an average demand expected to be around 100-110 units (accounting for a potential late-November boost), 646 units is nearly sufficient to cover the rest of the game (7 * 100 = 700). I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain a safety buffer for the final periods without significantly increasing holding costs.",

Historically, the demand regime peaked in late October (150 units) and has since stabilized at ~95 units/period (Periods 39-41: 97, 92, 95). With the game ending at Period 47 and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, order decisions must consider the remaining window. Current on-hand inventory is 451 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate (~95 units/period). In-transit inventory consists of 150 units (50 ordered in each of Periods 39, 40, and 41). These will arrive in Periods 43, 44, and 45 respectively. Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 601 units. Given there are only 6 periods remaining (42 through 47), and current demand is ~95, total expected demand for the rest of the game is ~570 units. My current inventory position (601) already exceeds this forecast. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without providing additional sales benefit, as the on-hand stock is already high enough to prevent stockouts before the next arrivals. Therefore, I will place an order of 0 to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory costs.",

We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), heading into the final four periods (44, 45, 46, 47) of the game. Recent demand has shown a significant drop from the ~95 units/period seen in November to 44 units in Period 43 (Dec 2), likely marking a transition into a late-December/holiday slowdown or clearance phase. On-hand inventory is currently high at 348 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive in Period 48, which is after the game ends in Period 47. Therefore, new orders are physically incapable of satisfying demand within the game's duration. Given the current inventory (348) and the projected demand for the remaining 4 periods (estimated at ~40-60 units/period, totaling ~160-240 units), the existing stock is more than sufficient.
