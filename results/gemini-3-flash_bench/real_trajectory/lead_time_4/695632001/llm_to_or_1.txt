Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Gyda blouse'. The product is a soft weave blouse for women, likely a staple or early spring transition item. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand samples (last 5 periods) are: 172, 178, 181, 109, 165. The mean of these samples is 161 and the standard deviation is 29.5. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. The February dates don't suggest an immediate major holiday spike, but we must establish a baseline. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent level, and use the 'default' lead time (4) while waiting for arrival data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 'Gyda blouse', a year-round staple item. Historical demand (5 samples) shows mean=161, std=29. Period 1 demand was 143, within the normal range. Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 143 units of sales in Period 1 due to stockout. 210 units are in-transit from the Period 1 order. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). To ensure we return to a healthy inventory state, I will maintain the promised lead time and use recent demand data to set the base stock level. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the P1 demand of 143) to capture the base demand level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse), we have zero on-hand inventory and 414 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 2 periods, no arrivals were expected yet (Scenario A in instructions). Demand in P1 (143) and P2 (194) resulted in lost sales because of zero starting inventory. Historical demand samples (last 5: 172, 178, 181, 109, 165) show an average of approx 161. Recent demand (last 2: 143, 194) averages 168.5. This suggests demand is stable. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the most relevant recent history including the late Jan/early Feb samples. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (4 periods) as we haven't seen any concluded arrivals to suggest a deviation yet. mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Gyda blouse', a staple women's garment. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 172, 178, 181, 109, 165 (mean ~161). Demand in the first 3 game periods was 143, 194, and 156 (mean 164.3). This suggests a stable demand regime around 160-165 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 628 units (from orders in P1, P2, and P3). Because actual arrivals for the P1 order should occur in Period N+L (1+4=5), we do not expect any arrivals until the start of Period 6 (visible in the P5 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected given the lead time constraint. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 (integrating the 5 historical samples and 3 game samples) to capture the stable mean and variance. Lead time will remain at 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Gyda blouse', a women's clothing item. Current inventory is critically constrained: On-hand is 0, and we have 835 units in-transit. Our demand history (including provided pre-game samples) shows a steady average around 157 units per week (Recent data: 143, 194, 156, 145; Pre-game: 172, 178, 181, 109, 165). The promised lead time is 4. According to the 'Critical Timing Example', the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5. This arrival is not yet visible because Period 5 has just started. We expect the Period 5 conclude message to show the arrival of the 210 units ordered in Period 1. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot infer a lead-time shift; we will stick to the default promised lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the last 9 samples (4 game + 5 pre-game) show stability. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this mean, ensuring the backend sets a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~785 units). Since in-transit (835) already exceeds this, the OR engine's capped policy will likely temper new orders until arrivals begin clearing the pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Gyda blouse', which is a standard women's tailored item. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been relatively steady around 150-180 units, with a slight dip in the most recent periods (145 and 117). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (L=4). We currently have 93 units on hand and 686 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since actual lead time matches promised lead time and the demand shows a slight downward trend over the last two weeks, I will use recent_N (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent slowing while maintaining the default L calculation. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock for L+1 (5 periods) of coverage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand showing a slight decreasing trend (avg ~130 over last 2 periods vs ~170 historical).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1 and P2 in P5 and P6. History shows a clear demand shift: pre-game samples averaged 161 (172, 178, 181, 109, 165), while the last 4 observed periods (P3-P6) show a lower average of 134 (156, 145, 117, 118). Specifically, the last two weeks have dropped below 120. This indicates a cooling in demand for the Gyda blouse. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent lower regime, covering the (L+1) = 5 period risk horizon. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the lower volatility observed in these recent periods. Lead time (L) is set to 4 based on confirmed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased from ~160 to ~134 (-16%) based on P3-P6 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1707.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-01. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, the mean demand was ~161. However, since Period 4 (early March), demand has dropped consistently: 145, 117, 118, 105 (average of last 4 periods is 121.25). This represents a clear downward shift, likely moving away from a post-holiday/early-spring peak. The lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by Period 1, 2, and 3 orders all arriving with L=4). Pipeline inventory is 350 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 288. Total inventory position (638) is high relative to the new demand level (approx 5 * 121 = 605). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime and calculate for lead time to reflect the confirmed stability. sigma_hat will use the recent 4 samples to adjust for the lower variance seen in the recent stable decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 4-7 average demand (121) is 25% lower than early-year average (161).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3565.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019-04-08), we analyze SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse). History confirms a lead time of 4 periods (P4 order arrived P8). Regarding demand, we observed a significant spike in P8 (203 units), which deviates from the downward trend noted in previous periods (avg ~121). However, historical data from early January shows higher demand (172-181), and the P8 spike may indicate a seasonal recovery or pre-spring movement. Given the high on-hand inventory (292) and in-transit units (174), we are currently well-stocked. We use L=default (4). For mu_hat, because of the recent volatility (P7: 105, P8: 203), we select recent_N with N=5 to capture both the preceding low and the recent high, averaging approximately 132 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=5 for OR input). For sigma_hat, we use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the latest period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 8: spike to 203 units after a 4-period period of low demand (avg 121), potentially signaling a seasonal shift.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The 'Gyda blouse' has shown a period of lower demand (Periods 4-7, avg ~121) followed by a significant spike in Period 8 (203) and a correction in Period 9 (135). The April spike (Period 8) likely relates to Spring seasonal shifts in women's tailoring. Looking at the full history including the seeding data (172, 178, 181, 109, 165) and game history (143, 194, 156, 145, 117, 118, 105, 203, 135), the mean demand across all 14 samples is approximately 151. Since the recent volatility (203 then 135) suggests a regime change or seasonal peak, I will use a shorter window (recent_N) to capture the current mean and heightened variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. mu_hat will use recent_N=6 (covering P4-P9) to balance the low-demand dip with the recent spike, resulting in a slightly conservative but responsive forecast for the 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in April: Period 8 spike (203) followed by Period 9 (135) suggests seasonal variance for Spring tailoring.

We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a Gyda blouse (Tailoring category). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P6 arrivals). Current on-hand is 215, with 433 in-transit (orders from P7-P10). Recent demand has been volatile: P8 (203), P9 (135), and P10 (82). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 128.6, compared to the overall average of 144. The recent drop to 82 in P10 suggests the post-Easter/Early Spring peak might be cooling off, or it's a variance fluke. Given the tailoring category and late April date, demand is likely stabilizing. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the shift and the recent spike) and explicit lead time of 4 to match historical arrivals. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility seen in April.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in April: P8 spike followed by P10 drop (82) indicates a shift from the early April peak; 5-period average now ~129.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'Gyda blouse', a tailoring item for women. Historical data and recent trends show that demand peaked in early April (Period 8: 203) and has since cooled down (Period 11: 96). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P7). Current on-hand inventory is 122, with a substantial pipeline of 594 units (including 31 from P8 arriving next period, 203 from P9, 196 from P10, and 164 from P11). Given the soft demand over the last three weeks (82, 96, and the previous 135) compared to the overstocked pipeline, I need to prevent excess inventory buildup. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand level (avg ~129) and 'calculate' for lead time since performance is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 129, reflecting a 20% decrease from the initial 5-sample average (~161) following the early April tailoring spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Based on 'Period 12 conclude', the order placed in Period 8 (31 units) arrived after 4 periods, confirming the lead time (L) remains stable at 4. Demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been [203, 135, 82, 96, 121], giving a mean of 127.4. This confirms the lower demand regime (~129 vs the initial ~161) noted in carry-over insights. As this reflects the current May post-Easter/Spring peak environment for tailoring, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P8-P12). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in April (standard deviation of ~46.5). The OR parameters (L+1) will ensure we cover the current demand trend while accounting for the high in-transit pipeline (692 units) which includes much larger orders placed in P9 and P10 (203 and 196 units respectively).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-April peak: average demand for P8-P12 is 127.4 units/period, roughly 21% lower than the early year baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). The SKU is a 'Womens Tailoring' blouse, which saw a peak in early April (Period 8, demand 203) and has since stabilized at a lower level. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is 123.5 units/period, compared to the early-year average of ~160. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 131, with 576 units in-transit. Arrivals over the next two periods (ordered P10 and P11) are 196 and 164 units respectively, which are quite high relative to recent demand (~124). For Period 14, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stabilization. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock down, preventing excessive inventory buildup given the large incoming shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-April peak: average demand for P8-P13 is 123.5 units/period, approximately 23% lower than the early year baseline (161).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blouse. Historical data showed a demand spike in early April (P8: 203), followed by a sustained stabilization at a lower level. Demand over the last 7 periods (P8-P14) has averaged 122.0 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P12-P14) averaged 112.7 units. The 'Carry-over insights' correctly identified this post-peak regime. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P10 order arrived P14). On-hand inventory is currently high (214 units) due to the arrival of the Period 10 order. With 450 units in transit (from P11 to P14), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-April stabilization period (N=7 covers P8-P14). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's blouse (Gyda blouse), which saw a peak in demand earlier in April (Spring tailoring) but has since settled into a lower, stable demand regime. Period 15 demand was 81, significantly lower than the historical average (161) and slightly lower than the recent 8-period average (P8-P15 avg: ~117). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P11 arrived P15). On-hand inventory is high at 297 units with 378 units in-transit. Given the stabilized post-peak regime and the current inventory surplus, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower demand level (covering P8 to P15). This avoids over-ordering while account for the higher volatility observed in April. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P8-P15) average is 116.8 units/period, roughly 27% lower than the early year baseline (161).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct regime shift following the April peak (Period 8). The average demand from Period 8 to Period 16 is approximately 112 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial start-of-year average of 161 (a ~30% reduction). Most recently, demand has dropped further, with the last three periods (P14-P16) averaging only 89 units. The Gyda blouse, being womens tailoring, likely experiences lower demand as we transition into the warmer summer months. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P12 order arriving exactly at P16 conclude). We have 352 units on hand and 304 in-transit (orders from P13-P16), totaling 656 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current downward trend, I will adjust mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the Period 8 spike) to capture the current post-peak regime and prevent overstocking during the summer slowdown. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P8-P16) average has decreased to 112.1 units/period; most recent 3-period average (P14-P16) is 89.3, indicating a potential secondary summer slowdown.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's tailored blouse. We are observing a significant and sustained downward trend in demand as we move into the summer months. The initial average (P1-P5) was ~161, but the post-April average (P8-P17) has dropped to 107.6, with a more recent 4-period average (P14-P17) of only 83.75 units. This suggests a seasonal slowdown in professional tailoring. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 372 units, and there are 268 units in-transit (orders from P14-P17). Given the current on-hand inventory alone covers over 4 periods of the recent average demand, and in-transit units will continue to arrive, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to avoid further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the backend policy naturally restricts ordering.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slowdown confirmed: Average demand for P14-P17 is 83.8 units/period, a 48% decrease from the early year baseline (161).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The Glyda blouse (Womens Tailoring) is experiencing a sustained summer slowdown. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged 76.6 units (113, 81, 74, 67, 48), showing a clear downward trend and a significant 52% reduction from the early-year baseline of ~161. Specifically, the last 2 periods have seen demand drop below 70 units. With on-hand inventory at 394 and in-transit at 198, total pipeline inventory (592) is very high relative to current demand. At an average of ~60-70 units/period, this inventory covers nearly 8-10 periods, far exceeding the L+1 window of 5 periods. Therefore, maintaining low OR parameters to prevent further accumulation while the stock depletes is necessary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower, summer demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slowdown confirmed: Average demand for P14-P18 is 76.6 units/period (a 52% decrease from early year baseline), with the most recent two periods (P17-P18) averaging below 60 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695632001' (Gyda blouse) is currently experiencing a significant summer demand slowdown as expected for a tailoring-heavy blouse item. The most recent demand samples from Period 17 to Period 19 show a drop to an average of 56.3 units/period, down from the earlier 'post-peak' average of ~112 and the initial year baseline of 161. Current on-hand inventory is high at 432 units, which is approximately 7.6 periods of current demand coverage. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the sustained low demand regime (N=6 for mu_hat based on P14-P19), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 samples to reflect the summer slowdown and prevent over-ordering. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the inventory surplus, which will help reduce holding costs during this slow period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slowdown deepened: Average demand for P14-P19 is 72.8 units/period (55% decrease from early year baseline); most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) average 56.3 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Women's tailoring blouse) is currently in a deep summer demand slowdown. Historical demand from the early year (Feb-Mar) averaged 161, but the last 7 periods (P14-P20) have averaged only 70.7 units. The most recent three periods (P18-P20) are even lower, averaging approximately 53 units/period. The inventory on-hand is currently 429 units, which covers over 8 periods of current demand levels. Furthermore, there are 51 units in-transit (ordered in P17). The actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while the demand is at this seasonal trough. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the summer regime from P14 onwards) to represent the current lower demand level. For L and sigma_hat, I will use defaults as lead time is stable and variance is scaling appropriately with the mean.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slowdown sustained through Period 20: average demand for P14-P20 is 70.7 units/period (56% decrease from early year baseline); most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show stabilization near ~55 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data (Period 17-21) confirms a significant summer slowdown for the 'Gyda blouse', a tailoring item. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 62.4 units, with the most recent Period 21 showing a slight uptick to 85, possibly from a localized promotion or holiday effect, but still well below the early annual average of 161. Current on-hand inventory is 395 units, which provides more than 6 periods of coverage at current demand levels. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a lead time of 4 periods consistently observed in history, we are overstocked. No new orders are needed for the immediate future to minimize Holding Costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained lower demand since late May (P14-P21), which averages approximately 66 units per period, and I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility of this summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization (P14-P21): average demand is 69.4 units/period, roughly 57% lower than the early year baseline (161). Recent 3-period (P19-P21) average is 65.7 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/15, typically a mid-summer period. The 'Gyda blouse' has experienced a significant demand slowdown starting from mid-May (Period 14), dropping from a baseline of ~160 to as low as ~55. However, the last two periods (P21 and P22) have shown a slight recovery (85 and 103 units respectively), suggesting the deep summer trough may be passing or settling at a post-peak plateau. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the Period 18 order was for 0 units, the arrival in Period 22 was correctly 0. I will use a recent demand window (recent_N=5) to capture this moderate recovery trend while ignoring the high volumes from early spring. On-hand inventory (292) is currently high relative to the recent demand average, but we must maintain stock for the lead time duration (L+1=5 periods). Setting N=5 for mu_hat correctly weights the current recovery.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer trough recovery: Demand in P21-P22 (avg 94) is 43% higher than the preceding P18-P20 trough (avg 55.6), though still 41% below the early year baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) is currently in a recovery phase following a significant summer trough. Period 21-22 saw demand jump to an average of 94 units before settling to 66 in Period 23. This suggests a shift away from the deep summer low (avg ~56) toward a more moderate late-summer/pre-autumn level. Historically, lead time has been consistent at 4 periods, which is used here. For demand forecasting, I am shifting focus to a more recent window (N=5, covering Periods 19-23) to capture this emerging stabilization/recovery while dampening the impact of the deep June/July lows. The average demand in this 5-period window is ~75 units per period. Using this recent data for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the older, higher spring baseline. No orders arrived in Period 22 or 23 because no orders were placed in Periods 18 or 19; arrivals are expected to resume in Period 25 from the Period 21 order.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery trend confirmed: Demand in P21-P23 (avg 84.7) is 50% higher than the P18-P20 trough (avg 56.6). Stabilizing around a new moderate baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Womens tailoring blouse) is currently in a post-summer recovery phase. Recent demand has been highly volatile: P22 saw 103 units, P23 saw 66 units, and P24 dropped significantly to 25 units. This volatility is characteristic of clearance or seasonal transition periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since P21, we have had three consecutive periods (P22, P23, P24) where arrivals were 0, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 (orders from P18, P19, and P20 were 0 units). We expect the P21 order (41 units) to arrive in P25. On-hand inventory (201) plus pipeline inventory (216) equals 417 units. Given the most recent 4-period average demand is ~70 units, the current total position covers approximately 6 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer stabilization/recovery trend (averaging ~68 units/period) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent high variance (stdev of the last 5 periods is ~31).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery volatility: Demand fluctuates significantly (Range 25-103) as the season transitions, with a 5-period average (P20-P24) of 67.4 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) is currently in a late-summer phase. Historically, demand peaked in early year/April and hit a deep trough in June/July (avg ~55-70). Recent data (P21-P25) suggests a stabilization or slight recovery, with a 5-period average of 67.4 units. Period 25 demand was 58 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P21, P25) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Note: Orders from P18, P19, and P20 are missing from the 'conclude' messages, but those were zero-unit orders, so no arrival was expected. Orders from P22 (4 units), P23 (98 units), and P24 (73 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P26, P27, and P28 respectively. To calculate the OR parameters: L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P21-P25) to capture the current post-summer stabilization (avg 67.4 * (1+4) = 337). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std is approximately 29.5, which the backend will use).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P21-P25): Average demand is 67.4 units, recovering from the P18-P20 trough of 56.3 units but remaining well below the 161 baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Womens Tailoring Blouse) is in a post-summer stabilization phase. Demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has averaged 71.2 units, a significant recovery from the mid-summer trough (P18-P20 avg: 55.6) but still well below the early-year baseline of ~160. Most recently, P26 demand was 90, suggesting a possible modest uptick as late August approaches and the tailoring category typically sees renewed interest for late summer/early autumn transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P21 and P22 arrivals). On-hand inventory is 98, with 258 units in-transit. To calculate mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P21-P26) while ignoring the deeper summer trough. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization (P21-P26): average demand is 71.2 units/period, showing a 28% recovery from the summer trough (P18-P20 avg 55.6).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for the Gyda blouse shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in early spring (P1-P4 avg: 161), a significant summer slowdown (P18-P20 avg: 56), and a recent recovery beginning in late July/August. Over the last 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer trough, with an average of 76.3 units/period and a recent 2-period average of 98.5. This aligns with late-summer/pre-fall retail cycles. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P25-P27). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers the post-summer recovery phase) to project demand around 76 units/period, ensuring the OR engine captures the upward trend from the summer low while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility (range 25-107). Pipeline inventory is healthy (263 in-transit + 89 on-hand), covering the projected 5-period demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized (P21-P27): Average demand increased to 76.3 units/period, a 37% increase from the summer trough (P18-P20 avg 55.6) but still 53% below early spring levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) is currently in a post-summer demand stabilization/recovery phase. The late August average (P21-P28) has climbed to approximately 75 units/period, which is a significant increase from the mid-summer trough (avg ~56 units/period), although still below the early spring peak. I've chosen a recent_N of 8 to capture this entire stabilization phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P25-P28), with orders from P21-P24 arriving exactly on time. On-hand inventory is currently low (95), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (314 units) from recent larger orders (P27-P28). The OR backend parameters are set to reflect this stabilized demand mean and continued on-time lead-time performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization (P21-P28) average demand is 75 units/period, a ~34% recovery from the summer trough (avg 56) but remains ~53% below spring levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695632001' (Gyda blouse) is entering September, moving past the summer slowdown and into a more stabilized post-summer demand regime. Lead times are consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 21, demand has averaged approximately 75 units/period (P21-P29 mean = 74.4), which is significantly higher than the summer trough average of 56 units, but still below the spring peak. The most recent demand (P28: 67, P29: 66) suggests a stable environment. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P21-P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-recovery behavior accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock based on the current ~75 units/period demand level. The carry_over_insight reflects the confirmation of this post-summer plateau.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand has stabilized: average demand for P21-P29 is 74.4 units/period, representing a sustained ~33% recovery from the summer trough (avg 56) but remaining ~54% below early spring levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand spiked to 141 units (the highest since April), causing a stockout (on-hand is 0). This suggests a transition out of the summer lull into the autumn tailoring season. Looking at the history, the 'Gyda blouse' (womens tailoring) had much higher demand (avg ~160) in the early year (Feb-Mar). The recent 9-period 'post-summer' average was around 74, but the most recent 3 periods show a clear upward trajectory (67, 66, 141). To prevent further stockouts as we enter September, I am shifting the mu_hat forecast. I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture this rising trend (avg P26-P30 is 88.2), which provides a more responsive baseline than the full-history average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P26 arrival from P22, P25 arrival from P21).

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trend: Period 30 saw 141 demand, signaling the end of the summer trough. Demand is now shifting upwards from the 74.4 avg observed in P21-P29.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) is entering a significant autumn/back-to-work peak. The demand in Period 30 (141) and Period 31 (181) confirms a departure from the low summer/stabilization averages (~74 units) seen in previous months. This spike mirrors the early-year levels (starting samples avg 161). Current on-hand inventory is 0, making the pipeline critical. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend (116 to 181 in demand) over the last two periods, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P29-P31 avg ~129, with a strong emphasis on the latest 181). This will trigger larger orders to rebuild stock and cover the (L+1) window. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-work peak confirmed: Period 31 demand reached 181, matching early-year highs and signaling a sustained shift from the P21-P29 stabilization phase (avg 74).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn/Back-to-work peak (Sept/Oct), as evidenced by Period 31 and 32 demands of 181 and 180 respectively. This matches early-year high-demand levels (~160-180) and signals a significant shift from the summer trough. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and has missed sales in the last three periods due to stockouts. To capture this high seasonal demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the forecast immediately to the current demand level (~180). This will raise the base stock level to ensure that the pipeline (478 units in-transit) plus the new order is sufficient to cover the (L+1) period horizon at this higher velocity. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-work peak sustained: P31-P32 demand (avg 180.5) confirms return to early-year high demand levels, marking a ~140% increase over the P21-P29 stabilization avg (74.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand phase, likely driven by seasonal 'Back-to-work' tailoring demand (the blouse description supports this). Period 33 saw a massive demand spike of 451, following strong demand in P31 (181) and P32 (180). This far exceeds the P31-P32 average of 180.5. Consequently, the system is stocked out (on-hand: 0). We must aggressively increase our inventory target to capture this surge while balancing the risk of a sharp drop-off post-peak. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average ((181+180+451)/3 = 270.6) and scale it by (1+L). Given the volatility (spike from 180 to 451), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this local variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for September: P31-P33 average demand is 270.7, representing a 263% increase over the P21-P29 stabilization average (74.4). Significant demand spike in P33 (451 units) indicates extreme peak volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn peak for women's tailoring (Gyda blouse). Period 33 saw a massive spike of 451 units, and Period 34 followed with 264 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1067 units in-transit. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is approx 269 units/period. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to capture this new elevated regime while maintaining a high sigma_hat via the same recent window to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 180 to 451). This aggressive stocking is necessary to recover from the current stockout and meet the sustained seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Period 31-34 average demand is 269 units/period, a significant shift from the previous stabilization phase (74.4 avg). Period 33-34 specifically show extreme volatility with a peak of 451.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2774.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has shifted into a high-intensity Autumn/Workwear regime since Period 31. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 250.6 units, a dramatic increase from the mid-year stabilization of ~74 units. The product description emphasizes 'Tailoring' and 'Blouses', which align with peak demand in the transition from September to October. Recent demand has been highly volatile, peaking at 451. We are currently experiencing significant stockouts due to the lag between the demand spike and the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0. To capture high sales potential while managing the current extreme volatility, I am using a recent history of 5 periods (P31-P35) to set the mu_hat. This covers the entire duration of the new high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 5 periods to reflect the heightened variance observed (Range 177-451). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P35).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime (P31-P35) average demand is 250.6 units, representing a 237% increase over the Summer stabilization period (P21-P29) and high volatility (Std Dev ~115).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn high-demand regime that began around Period 31. Recent demand (P31-P36) shows an average of 240.7 units/period, far exceeding the earlier summer stabilization levels (~74). Demand remains volatile (ranging from 177 to 451), likely driven by the 'Autumn/Back-to-work' seasonality for tailoring products. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (20 units) due to massive stockouts between P30 and P35, but a large pipeline (1476 units) is in transit from recent orders (P33-P36). To handle the current high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P31 demand shift. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for ~240 units/period while accounting for the high volatility observed in the peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P31-P36) average is 240.7 units/period with high volatility (Std Dev ~105), representing a 225% increase over the summer stabilization average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn high-demand regime (Sept/Oct). Recent demand observations for P31-P37 (181, 180, 451, 264, 177, 191, 250) show a significantly higher mean and variance compared to summer. The average demand over these 7 periods is approximately 242 units/period. Period 37 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory due to a demand of 250 exceeding the arrival of 182 plus the small starting stock. Total in-transit inventory is 1400 units, which covers several periods of forecasted demand; however, the OR engine needs accurate parameters to maintain the specific service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this regime shift specifically, as it represents the 'Back-to-Work/Autumn' season. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P31-P37) average demand is 242.0 units/period with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~95) compared to earlier periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695632001' (Womens Tailoring Blouse) is in an Autumn/Winter peak demand phase. Demand over the last 8 periods (P31-P38) has averaged 254.4 units, showing high volatility (Std Dev ~86) compared to the summer months. Most recent demand in P38 was 271. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' is 1046 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of demand at the current high-demand rate (4 * 254 = 1016), plus on-hand inventory of 257. To maintain the 95% service level while accounting for the high volatility observed since September, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the 8-period autumn regime (N=8). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the elevated mean and the significant variance introduced by the P33 spike, helping guard against stockouts during this peak season while managing holding costs as on-hand inventory has finally recovered.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P31-P38) average demand is 254.4 units/period with sustained high volatility (Std Dev ~86). Current on-hand inventory (257) is the first healthy buffer since the summer transition.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the autumn high-demand regime is sustained. Since Period 31, demand has averaged 245 units/period, far higher than the summer baseline of ~74. The last 9 periods (P31-P39) show significant volatility (Std Dev ~91), but we are finally out of stockout conditions with an on-hand inventory of 569. My objective is to maintain this service level while accounting for the lead time L=4. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the autumn regime (P31-P39) and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P31-P39) sustained: average demand 245 units/period, volatility significantly elevated (Std Dev ~91).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Autumn/Winter demand regime. Since Period 31 (post-September recovery), demand has averaged approximately 224 units per period (P31-P40), significantly higher than summer levels but exhibiting high volatility (Range: 128-451). Recent demand (P39-P40) has cooled slightly to 167 and 128 units, suggesting we may be past the peak of the autumn spike. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (728 units) with a significant pipeline (660 units), resulting from a large catch-up order placed in Period 34 (528 units) arriving recently. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand potentially cools further towards the end of the year, I am using a recent_N (N=10) approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the autumn regime's average and high variance while allowing recent lower samples to pull the forecast down slightly. This balances the risk of stockouts against the high current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P31-P40) average demand is 224.2 units/period; most recent 2 periods (P39-P40) show a cooling trend with a 147.5 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2646.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (2019/11/25). The high-demand Autumn peak observed from Period 31 to 38 (avg ~250) is showing clear signs of stabilization or a slight cooling trend. The average demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) is 156.3 units, significantly lower than the preceding peak but still higher than the summer trough. Volatility remains present but has moderated compared to the September/October peaks. On-hand inventory (660) plus in-transit stock (633) is currently high due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. To avoid excessive holding costs as we likely approach the end of the tailoring season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=5, covering P37-P41) to capture this cooling trend. This N=5 window yields a mean demand of approximately 178 units, which is a prudent middle ground between the peak and the recent low of 128. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak cooling: Average demand for P39-P41 is 156.3 units, a 37% decrease from the P31-P38 peak average (254).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13606.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we saw a significant demand surge to 722 units, likely a Black Friday or early holiday shopping spike for the 'Gyda blouse'. This follows a cooling trend in P39-P41 (avg ~156), which I incorrectly interpreted as a final seasonal decline. The 722 unit demand suggests that while the 'Autumn Peak' ended, a separate 'Holiday Spike' has occurred. Currently, on-hand inventory is 112 units with 459 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the timing (Dec 2nd), I expect demand to remain higher than the November cooling average but likely lower than the extreme Black Friday peak. I will use a 4-period recent average (P39-P42: 167, 128, 174, 722) which averages ~298 per period to set mu_hat, ensuring we cover possible sustained holiday interest without over-ordering as the game nears its end (P47). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this massive jump in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 722 units, a 360% increase over the previous 3-period average (156), associated with late November/Black Friday promotional activity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3164.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (Nov 25) spiked to 722 units due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a correction to 177 in Period 43. We are now in mid-December (2019/12/9), approaching the holiday peak. Historically, this SKU (Gyda blouse, tailoring) saw an initial high baseline of ~160 units/period and an autumn peak averaging ~240. Given the recent extreme spike (P42) and the return to 177 (P43), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P39-P43) which averages ~274 units. This captures the recent volatility and the higher average during the Q4 season. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect the high standard deviation (~250) caused by the promotional spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for potential late-December demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Promotion Volatility: Period 42 demand spike of 722 units confirmed (Black Friday), followed by a return to 177 in Period 43. Q4 demand regime (P31-P43) average is approx 233 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4005.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 44 was 216 units, following 177 units in Period 43 and the Black Friday spike of 722 in Period 42. Total demand across the last 14 periods (P31-P44) averages 242.4 units, with historical lead-time consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (99), while in-transit is very high (1532), primarily due to large orders placed in P43 (765) and P44 (688) targeting the holiday season. Given the product is a blouse (potentially a gift item or party-wear), demand is likely to remain elevated or volatile through the end of December before potentially dropping in January. To balance the risk of running out during the final holiday stretch against the high in-transit pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the entire 'Autumn/Holiday' high-demand regime. This keeps a robust base stock to protect against remaining December peaks without over-ordering beyond the already significant pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Peak regime (P31-P44) average demand is 242.4 units/period, characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~143) and significant spikes (e.g., P42: 722). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the end of the year. Historically, demand for tailoring/blouses can experience a post-holiday lull in late December/early January, though we must maintain coverage for potential New Year surges or steady baseline sales. The most recent demand (P43-P45: 177, 216, 193) shows stabilization around ~195 units, significantly lower than the extreme Black Friday spike but higher than the summer trough. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1664 units in-transit. Arrivals have been consistently at a 4-period lead time. To balance the high service level (profit/holding cost ratio is 19:1) with the risk of holding excess stock into a possible January slowdown, I will use a recent 5-period average (P41-P45) for demand forecasting (approx 296 units per period including the lead window) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This N=5 captures the post-peak stabilization while still influenced by the 722 spike's trailing effect on variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday stabilization (P43-P45): Demand has settled to an average of 195.3 units/period following the Black Friday spike, indicating the extreme Q4 volatility is subsiding.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently on Period 47 (Dec 30). In Period 46, on-hand inventory was 0 and the order from Period 42 (Black Friday week) was expected to arrive but did not appear in the conclude message yet (it should arrive during Period 47's resolution phase). Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday average (P43-P46) at approximately 178 units per period, showing a significant drop from the peak but remaining higher than the summer baseline. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline (2353 units) relative to recent demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the post-holiday cooling trend while maintaining enough coverage for the current regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the holiday season and transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand cooling (P43-P46): demand has averaged 178.2 units, down from the peak November volatility, but remains elevated compared to summer levels.
