Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Men's PETAR Sweatshirt. Historically, the last 5 demand samples (Jan-Feb 2019) show a stable pattern with a mean of approx 82 units (75, 84, 83, 80, 88). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no lead time history yet, I will use the default promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the most recent and consistent regime of approx 82 units/week, which accounts for the current post-holiday/early-spring season. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand (~410 units). Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z*=0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Men's PETAR SWEATSHIRT. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a stable mean around 82 units. Period 1 actual demand was 51, which is significantly lower than previous weeks, possibly indicating a post-winter/early spring dip or a different demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (90 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in P6). Therefore, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the discrepancy between earlier historical samples (~82) and the most recent week (51), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (including the P1 data) to balance the forecast. Since we haven't observed any actual lead times yet, I will use the default promised lead time (4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and arrivals (with a promised lead time of 4) have not yet occurred. The historical demand samples (75, 84, 83, 80, 88) and recent recorded demand (51, 96) show a consistent mean around 80 units per week. The low demand in Period 1 (51) followed by Period 2 (96) suggests some variance, but the average remains stable near the long-term mean. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~400 units). Total pipeline (In-transit) is 192 (90 from P1 + 102 from P2). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable demand regime while relying on the default promised lead time (L=4) until arrivals allow for actual lead-time calculation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basics apparel item. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the timing rules, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 300 units in-transit (orders from P1: 90, P2: 102, P3: 108). We are experiencing lost sales because on-hand is 0. Demand for the last three periods (P1-P3) was 51, 96, and 92, while the pre-game samples (Jan/early Feb) were 75, 84, 83, 80, 88. The recent average demand is roughly (51+96+92)/3 = 79.6. However, P1 (51) looks like an outlier or partial week. Excluding P1, P2-P3 average 94. The OR backend uses (1+L) periods of demand. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods. Using 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent stable but slightly higher demand compared to the start of the year (average of last 5: 80, 88, 51, 96, 92 = 81.4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basic jersey sweatshirt. Demand has been fairly stable with an average of approximately 82 units/week (historical samples: 75, 84, 83, 80, 88; observed game history: 51, 96, 92, 76). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in Period 5, no orders placed within the game (starting Period 1) have concluded yet. An order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 407 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). The 'sold=0' in history confirms we have been out of stock since the game started, which is expected given the lead time. Given the consistency in demand and the early stage of the game, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the specific demand levels observed during the active game periods (average ~79), while keeping L at the promised default of 4. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via the base-stock formula.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a soft sweatshirt (basic jersey), which typically sees stable demand in early spring. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been consistent: [75, 84, 83, 80, 88, 51, 96, 92, 76, 74], with an average around 80 units/period. The outlier in Period 1 (51) occurred when on-hand inventory was zero, though the game records 'sold=0' for all periods before P5 due to zero starting inventory. Period 5 shows the first arrival (90 units from P1 order) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Current inventory: On-hand=16, In-transit=317 (from orders in P2, P3, P4). Since the lead time is 4, we expect the P2 order to arrive in the current Period 6 arrival resolution phase. Total pipeline + on-hand is high (333 units), which covers roughly 4 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the most recent stability, and default/calculate for lead time as the observed lead time matches the promise.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand and recent observations (P1-P6) show a stable mean around 80 units/period (Historical mean: 82, Recent P1-P6 mean: 75). Actual lead time is confirmed to be exactly the promised 4 periods based on P5 and P6 conclude messages (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 57. The pipeline (In-transit) is 271, which covers the expected demand for the L+1 window (5 periods * ~80 = 400 total requirement; 57 + 271 = 328). Note: sold units were 0 for P1-P4 due to 0 on-hand, but underlying demand was recorded. I will use recent_N=6 to encompass all active game periods to capture the most recent demand regime, which is slightly lower than the pre-game samples. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods align with reality.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand shows a downward trend: early samples were ~80, while the last three periods (5, 6, 7) show demands of 74, 61, and 54, averaging 63. This aligns with moving into spring (April) for a sweatshirt. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 arrived at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7). Currently, we have 111 units on-hand and 210 units in-transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Pipeline inventory is healthy. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (N=5 covers the shift) and maintain L=4. Given profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, so base_stock will target the mean demand over the protection interval.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: Average demand decreased from ~85 (Feb) to ~63 (late March/April) as seasonality shifts from winter to spring for sweatshirt products.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Current inventory is 134 on-hand with 139 in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding demand, the carry-over insight noted a decrease starting Period 5, but Period 8 showed a spike to 84. Looking at the history (P5: 74, P6: 61, P7: 54, P8: 84), the mean of these last 4 periods is 68.25. The spike in P8 suggests demand is volatile but stabilizing around a slightly lower mean than the initial 80-90 range. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 4 is reliable, so I will use 'default' for L.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses. Recent historical demand (P5-P9) averages 67, confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights (approx. 63-67 units/period), down from the initial average of ~85. The promised lead time is 4. Observations from P5 to P8 confirm actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). At P9 conclude, we see 0 arrivals, which is expected as no order was placed in P5. Current inventory: On-hand=72, In-transit=208. The in-transit units are from orders placed in P6 (56), P7 (47), P8 (36), and P9 (69). The P6 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P10) and become visible at the start of P11. To set parameters: L remains 4 (matching evidence). For mu_hat, I'll use the recent regime (P5-P9, N=5) to capture the seasonal decline. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a low-demand spring/summer season. The carry-over insight noted a drop in demand to ~63 around Period 5. Recent data shows a further decline, with Period 10 demand dropping to 32. This represents a significant seasonal shift. The average demand of the last 6 periods (Periods 5-10) is approximately 61.16, but the most recent two periods (62 and 32) suggest the 'spring' regime might be even lower. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10 all show L=4). Note: Period 5 had an order of 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in Period 9 conclude. Pipeline is currently 207 (Orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). On-hand is 96. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-winter regime while using default for L and sigma_hat to maintain standard buffers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further confirmed: Demand has dropped from ~85 (Feb) to ~61 (March-mid April), with a sharp late-April dip to 32, signaling deep seasonal decline for heavy tops.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a seasonal low as temperatures rise in late spring/early summer. Historical demand samples (before game start) averaged 82 per week, but recent data since Period 10 shows a significant drop (32 and 50). The 'Carry-over insights' confirm a regime shift starting around Period 5, intensifying in Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11 all show 4 periods). Note: Period 5 ordered 0 units, which is why Period 9 saw 0 arrivals. On-hand (93) plus In-transit (163) totals 256 units. Given the seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (~44 units/period) to avoid overstocking during the off-season. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains default as it is stable.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For SKU 685813001 (Sweatshirt), we are entering May (Period 13). Historical demand and carry-over insights indicate a significant seasonal decline as weather warms, despite a singular spike in Period 12 (98 units). Excluding that outlier, demand has averaged ~48 units over the last 4 periods (32, 50, 98, and including the 62 from Period 9). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on history (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8 all arrived in exactly 4 periods). Since the order from Period 5 was 0, no arrival was expected in Period 9, explaining the 'arrived=0' at Period 9 conclude. Current on-hand (31) plus in-transit (127) totals 158 units. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. At a conservative estimate of 50 units/period, we need ~250 units; however, given the strong seasonal downtrend for 'soft sweatshirt fabric' in May, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the post-winter drop while acknowledging the recent volatility, and keep L at default (4) as the supply chain is stable.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The PETAR SWEATSHIRT is experiencing a transition from its peak winter/early spring season into late spring/early summer. While a demand spike occurred in Period 12 (98 units), the broader trend since Period 5 shows a decline from ~85 to ~62 units, consistent with the seasonal cooling for heavy tops like sweatshirts. Period 13 demand (62 units) aligned perfectly with this lower regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains stable, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. Currently, there are 157 units in-transit (orders from Period 10: 55 units, P11: 3 units, P12: 0 units, P13: 99 units). With On-hand inventory at 38 and a significant order arriving soon from P10, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the post-peak regime from P5 to P13) to reflect the contemporary mean of ~68 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to capture the increased volatility seen in the recent spring spikes, ensuring the OR backend maintains a buffer against late-season demand fluctuations while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late May (Period 15). The product is a heavyweight sweatshirt, which is moving out of its primary season. Since Period 5, we have seen a demand regime shift from an average of ~85 to ~58. Recent demand has been quite volatile (ranging from 32 to 98), but the trend since April is generally lower than the initial weeks. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 198 (orders from Periods 11, 13, 14), which is high given the current demand trend. I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (since Period 5) to reflect the lower seasonal demand level. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (14) to capture the high volatility seen in recent weeks (e.g., the jump to 98 in Period 12) to ensure the service level is maintained despite the overall seasonal decline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27). The product is a sweatshirt, which is seasonally declining in demand as summer approaches. Historical demand has shifted significantly: from ~82 in Feb to ~60 in March/April, and further down to ~44 over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 50, 98, 62, 35, 26). The volatility is relatively high due to a late-April spike (P12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 35, with a pipeline of 245 units (ordered P12-P15), which is quite high relative to current demand trends. To prevent overstocking during the off-season, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent seasonal drop and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent variability while minimizing excess safety stock. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand further decreased to ~44 (last 5 periods) as sweatshirt seasonality enters the summer off-peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (sweatshirt) is in a deep seasonal off-peak as of June 3rd. Historical demand has transitioned from ~85 (Feb) to ~61 (March/April) to recently ~44 and then significantly lower in the last three periods (26, 23). The period 12 demand (98) appears as an outlier or specific event, but the overall trend is downward. Currently, we have 12 units on-hand and 245 units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we are waiting on orders from Periods 13, 14, and 15 (99, 96, and 50 units respectively). This total pipeline (245) far exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), assuming the current summer demand stays around 20-30 units per week. No order was possible or necessary in P16, and our pipeline is already saturated. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime (average ~45, which results in (1+4)*45 = 225), which will trigger the base-stock policy to stop ordering since pipeline > base_stock. L remains at the promised 4 periods as evidence remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Seasonality for sweatshirts has reached summer lows; demand in the last three periods (26, 23) suggests a further drop from the ~44 average seen in mid-May.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The PETAR SWEATSHIRT is a heavy top experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we move into June. Historical demand has transitioned from ~85 (Feb) to ~63 (March/April), then ~44 (May), and most recently the last three periods show demand of 26, 23, and 16. The current date is June 10, typically a low point for sweatshirt demand. We have 95 units on-hand and 146 in-transit (orders from Periods 14 and 15). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should strictly target the expected demand. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current low-demand regime (avg ~21.7). This will likely result in zero orders this period as current inventory (241 units) far exceeds the demand for the next 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: 3-period trailing average demand has dropped to ~22 units as summer seasonality for sweatshirts takes full effect.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), and the product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. As established in the carry-over insights, demand has plummeted from ~85 in early spring to a 3-period trailing average of ~22 in Period 18, and most recently 12 units. This aligns with summer seasonality for heavy tops. Currently, we have 179 units on-hand and 50 in-transit. With an average demand of roughly 12-20 units and a promised lead time of 4, our current inventory (229 total) covers over 10 periods of demand, which far exceeds the L+1 (5 period) target safety stock. Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high inventory, the priority is to avoid ordering and allow on-hand stock to deplete. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent low-demand regime (16, 12, etc.) and 'calculate' for L to remain stable.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime for June (summer) confirmed at extreme lows, with the most recent sample at 12 units. Current inventory levels are significantly overstocked for the summer season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a sweatshirt, which is currently in its off-peak summer season (June). Demand has significantly declined, with the most recent observed demand at only 8 units (Period 19), compared to 80-90 in February. On-hand inventory is currently 221 units, while the recent 3-period average demand is only ~12 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and next period (L+1=5), the expected demand over the risk horizon is approximately 60 units (5 * 12). Since on-hand inventory (221) far exceeds this, no new orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods of extremely low demand to reflect the current summer regime, and the high on-hand inventory will naturally suppress ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand for Period 19 dropped to 8 units, with a 3-period average of ~12 units (Periods 17-19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is entering the peak of summer (July). Carry-over insights and recent history confirm a significant demand decline: Period 20 demand was only 6 units, following a trend of 16, 12, 8, and 6. The current 4-period average is 10.5 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 215 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers approximately 20 weeks of demand at current rates, far exceeding the safety stock requirements for the promised 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed. I will set L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current summer demand trough (approx 10.5 units/period) rather than the higher spring/winter data, ensuring the base stock target remains low to minimize holding costs until inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough floor established: July transitions with record low demand (6 units in Period 20). 4-period demand average is ~10.5 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting the peak of summer. Demand for the PETAR sweatshirt (a heavy, soft brushed inside top) remains at seasonal lows. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been 16, 12, 8, 6, and 20, averaging 12.4 units per period. The spike to 20 in P21 is likely a minor fluctuation or early clearance interest, but does not yet signal a return to high demand. On-hand inventory is significantly high at 195 units, which covers approximately 15 periods of demand at current rates. Given Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio for the backend OR engine is 0.5, implying a target of matching the median demand. With such high stock, I must set the parameters to prevent further ordering while the system works through the excess inventory. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent summer demand regime (N=5) and L to default (4), ensuring the base stock level remains far below current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists: Demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averages ~12.4 units, confirming the deep off-peak seasonality for sweatshirts in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we observe a notable demand spike to 46 units in Period 22, departing from the summer trough of ~10-12 units seen in June. This likely represents early 'Back to School' interest or a promotional event for sweatshirts. However, on-hand inventory remains very high at 149 units, which is significantly more than the current 5-period demand average (~18 units) or even the previous high-season average (~85 units). With a lead time of 4 periods, my priority is to continue liquidating the current overstock to minimize holding costs, as the stock on hand covers more than 7 periods of demand even at the recently elevated rate. I will maintain a lean forecast using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the slight uptick while allowing the OR backend to keep the order quantity at zero due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand signal observed: Period 22 demand rose to 46 units, a significant increase from the June/early-July summer trough which averaged ~12 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (2019/7/22), a period typically associated with the beginning of the Back-to-School (BTS) season for apparel. Demand for this sweatshirt SKU has risen significantly from the summer trough (average ~12 units) to 46 units in Period 22 and 35 units in Period 23. This confirms the start of a new demand regime. On-hand inventory is 114 units with 0 in-transit. A lead time of 4 means orders placed now arrive in Period 28. To cover demand over the L+1 window (Periods 24-28), we must account for the upward BTS trend. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples (mean = 40.5) to capture this recovery, resulting in a base stock target of (1+4)*40.5 = 202.5. With 114 on hand and 0 in-transit, the system should order approximately 88 units to protect against further BTS acceleration while remaining mindful of high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P22-P23 (late July) is 40.5 units, compared to the June/early-July summer trough of ~12 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. We are emerging from the summer trough for sweatshirts and entering the 'Back-to-School' season. History shows demand rose from ~12 units (June/early July) to an average of ~33 units over the last three periods (P22: 46, P23: 35, P24: 18). While P24 saw a temporary dip, the overall trend is upward compared to the summer floor. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volume shift (avg ~33/week) and avoid the extremely low summer values, while still being cautious about the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0). For sigma_hat, I'll use N=3 to reflect the current increased volatility seen in the transition away from the floor.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). We are observing the 'Back-to-School' transition for the sweatshirt SKU. After a summer trough where demand averaged ~12 units (June/early July), we've seen a clear shift starting Period 22 (July 8th). The samples since then have been 46, 35, 18, and 36, averaging 33.75 units. This indicates a recovery towards a more moderate demand regime prior to the autumn peak. On-hand inventory is 60, and in-transit is 69 (total 129 units). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 4-period mean (~34 units), the base stock requirement is roughly 170 units. My current total stock (OH + Pipeline) is 129. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by P15 order arriving P19). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the back-to-school recovery without over-weighting the summer lows or the distant spring highs, and use 'recent_N' (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility of this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery sustained: Demand for P22-P25 (July/early August) has stabilized at a higher level than the summer trough, with a 4-period average of 33.75 units compared to the June average of ~12 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27 (mid-August). Historical data shows 'Back-to-School' demand recovery began around Period 22 (July 8), shifting from a summer trough of ~12 units/period to a more robust average of ~33 units/period over the last 5 weeks. This shift is typical for sweatshirt products approaching autumn. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals consistently confirm a lead time of 4. Currently, we have 36 units on-hand and 109 units in-transit (ordered P24-P26). The OR backend calculation for base_stock (mu + z*sigma) will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline (145 units) covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the backend will aim for a 50% service level. By setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5, we capture the recent recovery (averaging ~32 units/period) while ignoring the extreme summer lows. L remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is entering a significant seasonal recovery phase (Back-to-School/Pre-Autumn). Demand in Period 27 surged to 73 units, the highest since April, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). The 4-period trailing average (P24-P27) is now 37.75, confirming a shift from the summer trough (~12 units) to a higher demand regime. Lead times have been stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 123 units in-transit (ordered P24-P27), we need to ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). Given the sharp uptick in demand (73 units in P27), using a recent 4-period average for mu_hat (N=4) captures the upward trend better than the long-term mean. Sigma_hat is set to recent N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Autumn demand recovery confirmed; Period 27 saw a spike to 73 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (33 units), leading to a stockout. High demand regime now established for early-Autumn transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 29), entering the peak autumn season for sweatshirts. Demand has surged significantly, with Period 27 at 73 units and Period 28 at 55 units, compared to the summer trough of ~12. We have experienced back-to-back stockouts (Periods 27 and 28), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in a rapid growth phase as the weather cools, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~58 units) while reacting to the increased volatility. This will ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock to meet autumn demand and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand in P27-P28 averages 64 units, a 5x increase from the summer trough (~12 units) and 2x increase from the back-to-school transition (~33 units). Sustained stockouts in P27-P28 confirm the supply-demand mismatch.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in September, the start of the autumn peak for sweatshirts. Demand in P27-P28 spiked to an average of 64 units, though P29 saw a drop to 34 units (likely due to immediate stockouts earlier in the period or natural volatility). The product is currently stocked out (0 on-hand). Lead times are stable at 4 periods. With 212 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, P29), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of high autumn demand. Given the stockouts and the seasonal transition back to levels seen in February (~80+ per week), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the start of the autumn spike P27-P29) to capture the higher mean of ~54 units/period, while maintaining a high sigma_hat via default to protect against stockouts during this volatile recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand spike sustained: Despite P29's lower recorded demand (34), the 3-period average for the late-August transition (P27-P29) is 54 units, significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 12 units. Sustained stockouts since P27 indicate inventory is trailing demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9). The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged since Period 27: the last four demands recorded are 73, 55, 34, and 88, though actual demand likely exceeds these figures due to consistent stockouts (on-hand is 0). The recent 3-period average is 59 units, and the 5-period average (P26-P30) is 54.8 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this autumn recovery effectively. Given the high seasonality and frequent stockouts, I will increase sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P24, P25, P26 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are 230 units in-transit (orders from P27-P30), which should begin arriving next period (P32) to resolve the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in early September: Period 30 demand reached 88 units despite stockouts in previous periods. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has risen to ~55 units, confirming a high-demand regime for the sweatshirt category.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sweatshirts is experiencing a significant autumn surge as we move into mid-September. Period 31 demand reached 106 units, following a trend of 73, 55, 34, 88, and now 106 since Period 27. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 71.4 units, which is much higher than the previous 'back-to-school' regime (~34 units) and the summer trough (~12 units). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 (5) periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this intensified peak (approximately 5 * 72 = 360 units target). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. L remains at the default promised 4 periods as shipments (P24-P27) have consistently arrived with a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified further in mid-September: Period 31 demand reached 106 units despite ongoing stockouts. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has risen to ~71.4 units, confirming a very high-demand regime for the sweatshirt category as weather cools.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the peak autumn demand phase for sweatshirts as temperatures drop. Recent demand (P31: 106, P32: 142) shows a significant surge, far exceeding the 55-70 unit averages discussed in previous periods. The system has suffered continuous stockouts since Period 27 because arrivals (which were ordered during much lower demand regimes) cannot satisfy current peak demand. The current in-transit (290 units) across the next 4 periods (promised lead time remains stable at 4) is insufficient for this new regime. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 600 (reflecting a forecast of ~120 units per period over the L+1=5 window) and increasing sigma_hat to 100 to account for high volatility during this ramp-up. L remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand intensified significantly in mid-late September: P32 demand reached 142 units, confirming a very high-demand regime (>100 units/period) compared to the early September average of 70 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a period of intense seasonal growth for sweatshirts (September/October), where demand has transitioned from a summer low of ~12 units to an explosive peak. Most recent demand at P33 reached 261 units, confirming the autumn surge is much stronger than early-September forecasts suggested. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current in-transit orders being consumed immediately upon arrival, we must aggressively increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to signal the OR backend to raise the base-stock level and the ordering cap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent explosive demand trend (P31: 106, P32: 142, P33: 261), which averages ~170 units per period. Using a larger N (like 5) would include lower demand values (88, 34) and under-forecast the current trajectory. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the high volatility during this ramp-up phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand has reached critical levels (P33 demand: 261 units), significantly exceeding early September averages (~80-100). The sweatshirt category is experiencing its primary seasonal peak as of late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn season for sweatshirts (October). Demand has reached extreme levels, with recent observations of 142, 261, and 156 units. Note that sales in P34 (58 units) were limited by starting inventory, not demand. The true demand for P34 was 156. The 3-period demand average (P32-P34) is approximately 186 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 638 units in-transit (P31: 44, P32: 96, P33: 194, P34: 304). The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average demand of ~185 units and a higher sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the late-September peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in late September/early October: Real demand for P32-P34 has averaged 186 units (142, 261, 156), significantly outstripping available supply and leading to persistent stockouts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt category is in its primary seasonal peak (mid-October). Recent demand has been extremely high: P33 (261), P34 (156), and P35 (191). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 202.6 units. Despite aggressive ordering, on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to persistent stockouts. We have 886 units in the pipeline (ordered P32-P35), but since demand is significantly outstripping arrivals, we must maintain a high base stock to capture remaining peak demand and build safety stock for the cooling season. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current 200+ unit demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: October peak demand confirmed: Average real demand for P33-P35 is ~203 units, a significant increase from the September average of ~70-100 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt category is in its primary seasonal peak (mid-October). Recent demand observations (P32-P36) show values of 142, 261, 156, 191, and 137, resulting in a 5-period average of 177.4. Despite high orders placed in recent periods (P33: 194, P34: 304, P35: 292), these are still in transit due to the 4-period lead time. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and reliant on the lead-time pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (approx. 177 units/period). Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Since demand volatility is high during this peak and the stockout risk is severe, sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to ensure the OR backend accounts for recent variance. Pipeline inventory (918 units) is substantial, so the OR engine will likely moderate new orders once the base stock is met.

Carry-over insight: October peak demand regime established: Average real demand for P32-P36 is 177.4 units (Range: 137-261). Current stockouts (P27-P36) are a result of the lag between the rapid September/October demand spike and the 4-period delivery lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October (Period 38), the peak season for sweatshirts. Demand remains high but may be stabilizing after the extreme late-September/early-October surge. Recent demand figures (P35: 191, P36: 137, P37: 155) average 161 units. Period 37 finally ended the stockout streak with 39 units remaining on-hand after a large arrival of 194 units. We have a significant pipeline (724 units) following aggressive ordering in periods 33-36. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the late-October demand average (~165 units per period) using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding over-response to the single massive outlier (261) from Period 33. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle the high volatility observed during the seasonal peak. No new order is likely necessary given the 724 units in transit, but 'default' L and a balanced mu_hat will ensure the OR engine maintains the correct base stock level for this peak period.

Carry-over insight: October peak demand regime remains stable: Average demand for P34-P37 is ~160 units (156, 191, 137, 155). This represents the primary seasonal peak for sweatshirts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn/early winter season for sweatshirts (November 4th). Previous demand data shows a sustained high-demand regime, with Period 38 recording a demand of 230 units. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 192 units. While the seasonal peak was established in October, early November tends to maintain high volumes before the deeper winter transition. On-hand inventory has finally recovered (113 units) due to the arrival of a large order (304 units), ending a long stockout streak. In-transit inventory remains high (456 units) as previous large orders process through the 4-period lead time. To prevent over-correction while maintaining high service levels for the peak, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime while smoothing the volatility of the 230-unit spike in Period 38. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime confirmed: Average real demand for P34-P38 (Oct-early Nov) is 192.4 units, representing the peak seasonal demand for this SKU.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand peak for sweatshirts (mid-November). Recent demand (P36-P39) has been 137, 155, 230, and 163, averaging ~171 units. The previous October peak average was ~192, so we are seeing a slight deceleration but remain at a high plateau. On-hand inventory is 242, and in-transit is 399 (comprising 128 from P36, 0 from P37, 36 from P38, and 235 from P39). Based on the lead time of 4, the 128 units ordered in P36 are expected to arrive in P40. The pipeline is relatively well-stocked to meet the (L+1) demand requirements. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current late-Autumn/early-Winter demand of ~171 units per period, which results in a mu_hat of ~855 for the 5-period window (L+1). This ensures we maintain a high base stock while acknowledging the slight cooling from the extreme October spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand has stabilized at a high late-Autumn plateau averaging ~171 units per period (P36-P39), slightly down from the early-October peak of 203.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late Autumn demand plateau for sweatshirts. Recent demand (P36-P40) has stabilized at an average of approximately 172.6 units per period (137, 155, 230, 163, 158). Using N=5 for recent demand captures this stabilized peak period effectively. On-hand inventory is 212 and pipeline inventory is 487 (orders from P38, P39, P40), totaling 699 units. This coverage is slightly below the target for a 5-period window ((L+1) * 172.6 = 863), but the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic should trigger a sufficient order given the high mu_hat. Promised lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent delivery history (P36 order arrived P40).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau for late Autumn confirmed: Average demand for P36-P40 is 172.6 units. Inventory levels are now reconciling with the 4-period lead time lag.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685813001' (sweatshirt) is currently in its late-autumn peak/plateau. Recent demand (P37-P41) has been 155, 230, 163, 158, and 195 units, significantly higher than the mid-autumn levels. The average demand over the last 5 periods (N=5) is 180.2 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 17 units on-hand and 631 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41), the pipeline is significant but must be managed carefully as we approach the end of the 47-period simulation. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current high plateau, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn high-demand plateau confirmed: Average demand for P37-P41 is 180.2 units, a sustained high level following the initial October spike.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685813001' (sweatshirt) has entered its primary seasonal peak as of early December (Period 43). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike to 420 units, far exceeding the recent plateau of ~170-180 units. This is likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 829 units in-transit. A significantly large delivery (235 units from Period 39) is expected to arrive during Period 43. Given the recent demand surge (420 units) and the persistent high-demand regime, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the accelerated late-autumn/early-winter pace (average ~227 units including the spike). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: Period 42 saw a spike to 420 units (Black Friday), lifting the 5-period average (P38-P42) to ~227 units, up from the October plateau of ~170.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-Black Friday period (December 9th), entering the final weeks of the holiday shopping season. Recent demand has been volatile due to the Black Friday spike in Period 42 (420 units) followed by a return to late-Autumn levels in Period 43 (166 units). The 5-period average (P39-P43) is approximately 221 units, heavily influenced by the spike. Excluding the outlier, the underlying high-demand plateau remains around 170-190 units. On-hand inventory is low (69 units), but in-transit inventory is high (931 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and relatively low profit margin per unit ($1.0), the OR backend's service level target (z*) will naturally aim for 50%. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the recent high-volume trend while remaining cautious about the single-period spike. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday) demand of 420 units represents a 2.4x increase over the previous 4-period average (~170 units). Post-spike demand (Period 43) has returned to the previous high-plateau level (~170 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-Black Friday/pre-Christmas period (mid-December). Demand for sweatshirts remains high but has stabilized into a plateau following the Black Friday spike (P42: 420 units). Recent demand (P43: 166, P44: 211) averages ~188 units, consistent with the late-Autumn high-plateau of ~170-190 units observed before the holiday surge. The game is approaching its conclusion (Period 45 of 47). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. The on-hand inventory is 74, and there is a large pipeline (817 units). Given the 4-period lead time, we use recent demand (N=5: P40-P44) to capture the high seasonal plateau (average 230.6, heavily influenced by P42). Setting L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods ensures the policy maintains a stock level appropriate for the current high-demand season without over-ordering as the game ends.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Following the P42 surge (420 units), demand has returned to a high plateau averaging ~188 units (P43-P44), aligning with the pre-holiday October/November trend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46). Historical data exhibits high demand for this sweatshirt SKU during the winter season, following the late November (Black Friday) peak of 420 units. Demand has stabilized into a high late-year regime, with the last 3 periods (P43-P45) averaging 180 units (166, 211, 163). Previous 'Carry-over Insights' confirm a high-demand plateau of ~170-190 units post-October. Current on-hand inventory is low (55 units), while in-transit is very high (932 units) due to aggressive ordering to meet the peak. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit quantity relative to the current demand regime, the goal is to maintain sufficient base stock while accounting for the significant pipeline. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the 180-unit plateau and the Black Friday peak, providing a robust forecast for the remaining winter weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-115.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is entering the post-holiday winter decline. From the game history, we see a sharp drop in demand at Period 46 to 87 units, compared to the previously sustained high plateau of ~170-190 units (P43-P45). Last year (P1-P4), demand in Feb/March was around 80-90 units. The drop to 87 units suggests we are returning to those late-winter levels. With on-hand inventory at 202 and a large pipeline of 866 units (covering the high-order volumes from P43-P46), we are significantly over-ordered for the projected demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs during the seasonal transition downward, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the post-holiday average of the last 3 samples (~137 units) to slow down replenishment, while using a recent N for sigma to handle the volatility of the recent peak-to-trough shift. The OR backend will see the high pipeline and naturally reduce or zero-out the order for this period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal decline confirmed: Period 46 demand (87) shows a ~50% drop from the Dec high-plateau (~188 avg), returning to early-year demand levels.
