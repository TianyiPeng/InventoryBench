Historical data shows a clear upward trend leading into February: Jan 7 (2), Jan 14 (1), Jan 21 (22), Jan 28 (71), Feb 4 (102). The current date is Feb 11, which is the week leading into Valentine's Day (Feb 14), a peak period for gift-giving in the accessories/handbag category. Demand has surged from low single digits to 100+ units per week. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4), I need to cover demand for Period 1 plus the arrival window (P2, P3, P4, P5). This is an L+1 cover. Assuming the current regime of ~100 units/week continues or slightly grows due to seasonality/Valentine's Day, I expect demand for the next 5 weeks to be at least 500-600 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an order for 600 units to establish a safety stock while meeting this identified demand regime.",

Expected total demand for the next 5 periods is approximately 450-500 units based on the current regime. Since 600 units are already in-transit and expected in Period 5, I will not place an additional order this period to avoid excessive holding costs in future periods, as the current pipeline already covers the immediate 5-period horizon.

The drop to 55 in P3 might be a fluctuation, but the general demand level is now much higher than the initial weeks of 2019. The average demand across P1-P3 is ~86 units/week. Lead time is promised at 4 periods. My P1 order (600 units) is expected to arrive at the start of P5 (next period) based on L=4 (P1 order + 4 = arrive during P5, visible P6 start). However, the manual states L=4 means order during P1 decision arrives during P5 resolution. Thus, I expect a large stock influx next period. Current pipeline is 750 (600 from P1, 0 from P2, 150 from P3). I need to cover demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (P4), totaling 5 periods of safety. Estimated demand for 5 periods @ 90 units/period = 450 units. My pipeline of 750 is already sufficient to cover this. However, since I currently have 0 on-hand and 750 in-transit with the first delivery (600) arriving very soon, I will place a small order to maintain the pipeline for the 4-period horizon after P5 arrivals. Given the volatility and the product type (handbags often have steady demand with seasonal peaks), I'll order 100 units to ensure I don't run dry if demand spikes again or lead times vary.",

Recent demand shows a significant surge: P26 (24), P27 (52), P28 (69), P29 (106), and P30 (84). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we lost sales in Period 30 (demand 84, sold 62). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline consists of 100 units (ordered P29, arriving P33) and 350 units (ordered P30, arriving P34). Given the current demand regime is approximately 80\u2013100 units/week, we will experience stockouts in Periods 31 and 32. Total pipeline (450) plus any new order must cover the lead-time window (P31-P35). Expected demand for P31-P35 (~5 periods * 90 units) is roughly 450 units. While the current pipeline matches this, we need to maintain a buffer to avoid future stockouts as we enter the peak autumn season.

Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P29 order (100 units) will arrive during Period 33, followed by the large P30 order (350 units) in Period 34. This means Periods 31 and 32 are guaranteed stockouts. Total inventory pipeline is 550 units. My goal is to cover demand through Period 37 (L+1 coverage). Expected demand for P32-P37 is roughly 540-600 units (6 periods * ~95 units). The current in-transit (550) nearly covers this. Since the holding cost ($1) is high relative to the profit ($4), I will place a moderate order of 100 units to ensure no second stockout cycle occurs after the current large shipments are depleted, while avoiding the massive overstock seen in the first half of the year.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 45 of a 47-period simulation. The item is a 'spacious handbag,' which experienced a significant holiday spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday period) with 221 units sold. Following that peak, demand has dropped sharply as expected for the post-holiday lull, with Period 43 and 44 seeing 18 and 14 units respectively. With only three periods left (45, 46, and 47), and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 49, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, we must rely solely on our existing on-hand inventory. Our current on-hand inventory is 63 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand of approximately 10-15 units per week for the final three weeks. Ordering more at this stage would only result in unnecessary procurement costs and potentially stranded capital without any benefit to the total reward.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are in the penultimate period (46 out of 47). The product is a 'Spacious handbag', and the date is December 23rd (Christmas week). History shows a major holiday demand spike occurred in Period 42 (late November), followed by a significant drop-off in December (Periods 43-45 averaged 18.6 units/week). With only 2 periods of demand resolution remaining (P46 and P47), the current on-hand inventory of 39 units is sufficient to cover the expected terminal demand based on recent trends (~15-25 units/week). Furthermore, with a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 50, well after the game concludes at Period 47. Therefore, no additional inventory should be ordered to avoid holding costs on stock that cannot be sold.",

{
  "rationale": "We are now at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), which is the final period of the game. The current status shows 34 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. Historically, late December demand for this handbag category has been very low, as evidenced by the last four periods (18, 14, 24, and 5 units). Given that any order placed today would have a lead time of 4 periods and would therefore arrive after the game has concluded, and considering there is sufficient stock to cover the expected minimal demand for this final period, no further orders should be placed. The goal is to minimize ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs while concluding the game.",
