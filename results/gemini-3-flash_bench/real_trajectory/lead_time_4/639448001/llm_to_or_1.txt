Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this 'Spacious handbag' shows a significant upward trend over the last 4 weeks: 1, 22, 71, and most recently 102. This suggests a post-holiday build-up or a new product launch phase, likely peaking around late winter/Spring fashion seasons. The average of all five historical samples is 39.6, but the 'recent_N' approach (N=3) captures the latest regime (average 65) better than the full mean. Given the promised lead time of 4, our coverage window is 5 periods (L+1). L is set to 'default' as we have no delivery history yet. \u03bc\u0302 is set via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent acceleration while preventing over-extrapolation from just the single 102 value. \u03c3\u0302 is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a spacious handbag, often influenced by seasonality or fashion cycles. Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102, and most recently 86 in Period 1 (totaling 6 samples). This indicates a significant regime shift from very low to high demand. On-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 86 units of sales in Period 1 because the initial order of 132 units is still in transit (promised lead time is 4). Since the demand has stabilized at a higher level over the last 3 samples (71, 102, 86), I will use the last 3 samples to forecast. N=3 is chosen to capture the most recent high-demand regime while ignoring the near-zero values from early January. Given the promised lead time L=4, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat based on (1+4)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has surged significantly desde mid-January, likely due to spring season trends for accessories like this 'Period tote'. Recent demand (Periods 1 and 2) was 86 and 118, continuing an upward trend from the pre-game samples (71, 102). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 244 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. Given the timing, orders from Period 1 (132 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (conclude message visible in P6), and Period 2 orders (112 units) in Period 6. Since we have no observed arrivals yet to verify actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For demand, the last 4 samples (71, 102, 86, 118) indicate a clear upward regime shift compared to the very early Jan data. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-volume period while maintaining enough samples to manage volatility during this stock-out phase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Period tote' (Spacious handbag), currently in early March. Historical demand shows a significant ramp-up from early January (2 units) to early February (102 units). Since the game history began in Period 1 (2019-02-11), demand has remained high: P1=86, P2=118, P3=55. The average demand across these 3 periods is ~86.3 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (372 units total), which is expected as the first order (P1) is only due to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). There are currently 0 units on hand, leading to lost sales. To calculate parameters: L is set to default (4). For mu_hat, I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent stabilized high-demand regime (~86 units/period). This results in a target mu_hat of (1+4)*86 = 430. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in the actual game periods (std dev of [86, 118, 55] is ~31.8), resulting in sigma_hat of sqrt(5)*31.8 \u2248 71.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-11. The SKU 639448001 (Women's Tote) is in a significant stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, demand spiked in late January (up to 102) and settled into a range of 55-118 in February/March. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, 491 units are in transit (orders from P1-P4). Given the consistent demand and current stockout, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=5) to capture the recent demand stabilization. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 5 samples, representing the current demand regime. L is set to default as we haven't yet reached the threshold to confirm a lead-time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5, confirming the promised lead time L=4 (Actual L = 5-1=4). Demand history shows a significant ramp-up in Jan/early Feb (peaking at 102 and 118), followed by a cooling period (approx 50-55 units/week) in recent weeks. The product is a generic 'Period tote' handbag. Since the 'Big accessories' seasonal peak often aligns with late winter/early spring transitions, the recent stability around 50 units per week suggests we have moved past an initial launch or early-season spike. However, total pipeline (on-hand 83 + in-transit 359 = 442) is high relative to the last 4 weeks of demand (~50/week). L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 50 = 250 units. We currently have 442 units accounting for the pipeline. Given the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), we need to avoid over-ordering. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-week regime (~54.75 average) to reflect this stability, using N=4. I'll use the default lead time (4) as confirmed by history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demand showed a significant peak in early February (reaching 102/118) which has since declined and stabilized around 25-50 units over the last three periods (P4: 55, P5: 49, P6: 25). The product is a 'Spacious handbag', and we have observed the initial launch/seasonal surge tapering off. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). We have 170 units on-hand and 247 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). Since the current demand regime (last 3 periods average ~43) is much lower than the initial surge, using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 will prevent over-ordering. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a 'Period tote' (handbag). Historical demand shows a significant spike in late January/early February (moving from 1 to 102), followed by a cooling-off period (86, 118, 55, 55, 49, 25, 55). The average demand over the last 5 weeks is approximately 47.8 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Currently, we have 243 units on-hand and 119 in-transit (from P4), giving us a pipeline inventory of 362 units. Given the recent demand average of ~48, our pipeline covers roughly 7.5 periods of demand, which exceeds the required (L+1)=5 periods. Based on the product type (handbag) and the end of the early-year surge, demand appears to be stabilizing at a lower level. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: post-February surge, demand has stabilized to an average of ~48 units per period (Periods 3-7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a spacious imitation leather handbag. Looking at the demand history, there was an initial surge in early February (up to 118 units), but it has settled into a stable regime. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 3-8), demand has been 55, 55, 49, 25, 55, and 61, averaging roughly 50 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). We currently have a high on-hand inventory of 301 units with 0 in-transit. Given the service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) and an expected demand of ~50 per week, a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods would be roughly 250-300 units. Since we have 301 units on hand and 0 in-transit, we are sufficiently stocked and the capped policy will likely result in an order of 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak demand regime, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is performing exactly as promised.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Period tote' (a spacious handbag) spiked in early February (reaching 102-118 units) but has since stabilized in a lower regime. Since Period 3 (Feb 25), demand has averaged 49.6 units per period, with the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) averaging 45.4 units. We have an on-hand inventory of 264 units and zero in-transit shipments. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~45 units, the target base stock is roughly 225 units. Since on-hand (264) already exceeds this coverage requirement and no shipments are in transit, the OR backend will correctly order zero units to reduce carrying costs while maintaining a high service level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as observed in the concluding messages for Periods 1-4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the post-spike stability while excluding the initial outliers.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), the 'Period tote' handbag is in a post-peak stabilization phase. Following the high demand in early February (639448001: 71, 102 units), demand has settled into a lower regime. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10), the average demand is 42.6 units (25, 55, 61, 37, 35), compared to the earlier surge. Current on-hand inventory is 229, which is quite high relative to this recent demand. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed in Period 5-8 concludes). Note that orders placed in Periods 5-9 were 0 because the backend capping logic and high inventory levels correctly suppressed ordering. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized, lower demand regime (N=5 covers Periods 6-10). The OR backend will likely not order this period as on-hand (229) significantly exceeds the projected base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~42.6 * 5 = 213).

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand stabilization: Period 6-10 average demand settled at 42.6 units, significantly lower than the Jan/Feb peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the early February peak (102 units) to a stabilized lower regime starting around Period 6. The average demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) is 41.6 units per period. Lead times have consistently matched the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (209 units) relative to recent demand, and there is a small pipeline of 13 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility allows the OR engine to adapt to this lower-demand regime while the high on-hand stock naturally prevents new large orders until the inventory level aligns with the current base stock requirements (calculating (1+L) * ~42 = ~210). Profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, resulting in a target service level of 0.8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels: Periods 7-11 average demand is 41.6 units, compared to the initial peak averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the early-year surge. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 50, but the average over the last 6 periods (Periods 7-12) is 43 units. The stock on hand (159 units) is quite high relative to this demand, especially since profit is $4 and holding cost is $1 (giving a critical ratio of 0.8, which is moderately sensitive to inventory costs). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all observed arrivals. Current Pipeline Inventory includes the orders from Period 10 (1 unit), Period 11 (12 units), and Period 12 (18 units), totaling 31 units. Combined with the 159 on-hand, we have enough stock to cover roughly 4.4 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent overstocking and further holding costs while still maintaining service levels, I will use a recent demand window of N=7 to capture the post-surge behavior while smoothing the slight uptick seen in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 8-12 average demand is 39.4 units, confirming a shift below the previously estimated 42.6 average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13, 2019. The product is a women's handbag. Historical data showed a significant peak in demand during Jan/Feb (Period 1-4), which has since stabilized to a lower level. Specifically, demand from Period 7 to 13 (the last 7 periods) shows values of 55, 61, 37, 35, 20, 50, 44. The average of these last 7 periods is approximately 43.1 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around 39-42 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in the early periods (P1-P4 orders arrived at P5-P8). We are currently in a transition where inventory is being drawn down from the large initial orders. On-hand inventory is 115, and in-transit is 73 (orders from P10-P13). At a lead time of 4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent demand (N=7) provides a stable estimate for this new regime (mu ~ 215.5 for 5 periods). High ending inventory (115) and pipeline (73) means the OR backend will naturally taper ordering. Setting N=7 for mu and sigma captures the post-peak volatility and mean accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 7-13 average demand is 43.1 units, confirming persistent lower levels following the initial Jan/Feb peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the demand for the spacious handbag SKU 639448001 has stabilized since the initial Jan/Feb surge. The average demand over the last 8 periods (Period 7-14) is 43.125 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (most recently the Period 10 order arrived in Period 14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 71 units with 126 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Total pipeline inventory is 197 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 captures the current stabilized demand regime (avg ~43). Using N=8 for sigma_hat provides a localized volatility estimate. This strategy maintains healthy stock levels for this handbag accessory during the late spring season while avoiding excessive holding costs from the earlier high-volume orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Period tote' (639448001) shows a clear regime shift after an initial seasonal peak in Jan/Feb (samples: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102). Since late Feb (Period 3), demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is 43.2 units, and over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), it is 43.8 units. The Carry-over Insights support this sustained level (~43 units). On-hand inventory is currently low (23 units), but the pipeline inventory is high (158 units), which captures orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P14, and P15). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak stable regime while maintaining enough sample depth to smooth out weekly volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Spacious handbag' peaked in early February (Jan 28: 71, Feb 4: 102) and has since stabilized at a lower level. Average demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 7-16) is 38.5 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods (as seen in Period 14, 15, and 16 conclusions). On-hand inventory is low (13 units), but there is a significant pipeline in-transit (202 units) consisting of orders from Period 13 (42), Period 14 (54), Period 15 (44), and Period 16 (62). The upcoming order from Period 13 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 17) and be visible in Period 18. Given the stabilization, I will use recent history (N=10) to forecast demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) for the lead time plus review period (1+L = 5 periods). Lead time remains at the default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 7-16 average demand is 38.5 units, confirming a consistent post-peak level for the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a spacious handbag, and demand has transitioned from higher levels in early 2019 to a stable lower regime. Analysis of demand since Period 7 (the established regime shift identified in carry-over insights) shows an average demand of 37.6 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 29 units. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is 26, with 189 units in transit (ordered in Periods 14-17). Since the pipeline is substantial (orders of 54, 44, 62, and 29 units), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand parameters to capture the current stable summer demand level, choosing N=11 to cover the period since mid-March (Period 7) when the current regime solidified. This will ensure we maintain enough stock to cover the (L+1) period lead time without over-ordering given the high in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for this spacious handbag SKU spiked in January/February (up to 102 units/week) but has settled into a significantly lower summer regime. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 18 is approximately 36.75 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 18) was exceptionally low at 7 units, but I will treat this as noise rather than a regime shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this stabilized post-peak average (~37 units/period across L+1 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory currently consists of 73 units on-hand and 157 in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). With a total pipeline of 230 units and an expected demand of ~185 units over the next 5 periods (L+1), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover demand while maintaining a buffer, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (service level target ~80%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the last two periods (P18: 7, P19: 4) has dropped significantly, likely reflecting a seasonal lull for this handbag SKU after the spring season. The period 7-16 demand average was 38.5, but the most recent 5-period average (P15-P19) has fallen to 25.6. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (113) plus in-transit (113) equals 226 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the downward trend, while maintaining standard sigma_hat to account for potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed in mid-June: Periods 18-19 average demand is 5.5, compared to the spring average of ~40, suggesting a seasonal low.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is a 'Period tote' (handbag). Current date is 2019-07-01. Recent demand (Periods 18-20) has dropped significantly to single digits (7, 4, 6), averaging ~5.7 units/period, compared to the spring average of ~40. This confirms a seasonal low for early summer. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 169) relative to this new demand level, which will incur significant holding costs. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the last arrival in Period 20 from Period 16). Given the stark regime shift observed over the last 3 weeks, I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current low-demand summer state. L remains at the promised default of 4 as actual lead times are stable. No order is expected to be placed by the backend because on-hand + pipeline exceeds the base stock target for this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer seasonal low: Period 18-20 demand average is 5.7 units, a -85% drop from the spring average of ~40.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for the 'Period tote' has entered a confirmed summer seasonal low, dropping from a spring average of ~40 units to a 4-period average of 5.5 units (Periods 18-21). On-hand inventory is high at 193 units, with 22 units in-transit (expected from the Period 18 order). With the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the required base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is approximately 27-30 units based on the current mean. Significant excess inventory exists, so no new orders are expected. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent the model from overreacting to the higher spring averages. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is a 'Period tote' handbag. Current context shows a significant and sustained drop in demand, confirmed as a summer seasonal low since mid-June (Period 18). Demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 18-22) has been [7, 4, 6, 5, 7], averaging ~5.8 units per period, compared to the spring average of ~40. On-hand inventory is currently 208 units with 0 in-transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, maintaining high stock during this low-demand phase is inefficient. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this new low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend stops ordering while inventory is high and aligns the base stock with the current low sales velocity.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer seasonal trough for 'Period tote': demand has stabilized at ~6 units/period since Period 18 (Date: Jun 10), representing a 85% decline from spring levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product, a 'Period tote' (spacious imitation leather handbag), is experiencing a significant seasonal trough. Historical demand since Period 18 (June 10) has dropped to an average of ~5.7 units per period, an 85% decline from the spring average of ~40. Currently, on-hand inventory is 203 units with no units in transit. Given the low demand (approx. 6 units/week), the current inventory is sufficient to cover roughly 33 weeks of demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met. To prevent further accumulation of inventory and avoid unnecessary holding costs, the OR backend should trigger a zero-order policy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this seasonal low regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for the lead time, which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than the current inventory + pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (Period tote) is currently in a deep summer seasonal low. Demand has been consistently low since Period 18 (June 10th), with the last 7 periods (P18-P24) averaging 5.57 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 198 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the current demand rate, the current inventory is sufficient to cover over 30 periods. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P17 and P18 in P21 and P22 respectively). To prevent excessive holding costs and over-ordering by the OR backend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this localized summer trough. I am leveraging the 'default' lead time as the observed lead times match the promised 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). The product, a 'Period tote' (spacious handbag), has been experiencing a significant summer seasonal low since mid-June (Period 18). Demand from Period 18 to Period 25 has averaged ~6.1 units per period, which is a sharp decline from the spring average of ~40 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 188 units, which is approximately 30 periods of safety stock at the current demand rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, minimizing excess inventory is priority. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect this current low-demand regime (approx. 6 units/period), allowing the OR engine to wind down the existing surplus before making new orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'Period tote' (639448001) has transitioned from a severe summer trough (~6 units/period between mid-June and late July) to a gradual recovery in August, with the most recent demand hitting 24 units. This likely signals the start of late-summer or back-to-school purchasing. However, the current on-hand inventory is 164 units, which is extremely high (nearly 7x the most recent demand). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), the priority is to bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs while the demand slowly recovers. I will use a recent_N (N=9) approach for mu_hat to capture the transition from the trough to the current uptick without over-reacting to the single 24-unit data point, and the same for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this transition. No new orders are expected or needed given the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled in August: Demand increased from a summer trough average of ~6 units to 24 units in Period 26, suggesting an end to the deep summer seasonal low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Period Tote (639448001) is clearly recovering from its summer seasonal low (approx. 6 units/period). Demand jumped to 24 units in Period 26 and then further to 52 units in Period 27 (Date: Aug 12). This aligns with a late-summer/back-to-school transition for a spacious handbag accessory. I am detecting a new demand regime starting at Period 26. To capture this upward shift without being overly influenced by the extremely low summer trough, I will use recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 (averaging samples from P25-P27: 10, 24, 52), which yields a per-period mean of 28.6. Since L=4, \u03bc\u0302 should reflect 5 periods of demand (1+L), totaling approximately 143. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 112 and 0 in-transit, setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on these recent signals will trigger a replenishment order to cover the accelerating demand while the 'cap' mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Aug 5 - Aug 12 demand rose from 10 to 52 units, signaling the end of the summer trough and the start of a late-summer/autumn regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (Period tote) has transitioned out of its summer seasonal low (approx. 5-7 units/period) into a strong recovery regime beginning in August. Demand over the last three periods has been 24, 52, and 69 units, indicating a sharp upward trend as we approach the autumn season. The current On-hand inventory is 43 units, with 64 units in-transit (ordered in Period 28). Given the lead time of 4 periods, current stock and the incoming order must cover demand until Period 33. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this local growth trend (averaging ~48 units/period, or 240 units for the L+1 window) and using the explicit method to ensure sufficient stock for this seasonal pivot. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery into autumn confirmed: Period 26-28 demand increased from 24 to 69 units, marking a definitive end to the summer trough (~6 units/period).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Period tote' (639448001) has entered a rapid growth phase following the summer seasonal trough. Demand increased from 24 (P26) to 52 (P27), 69 (P28), and a significant spike to 106 in P29. This aligns with late August/early September 'back-to-office' or 'autumn collection' trends for handbags. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 29 (sold 43 of 106). We are currently in a stockout. The pipeline inventory (150 units) consists of orders from P28 (64) and P29 (86). With a promised lead time of 4, the P28 order is expected to arrive in Period 32. Given the current trend, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect an expected average demand of ~90 units per period over the lead time (L+1=5) to ensure we rebuild stock and cover the high-demand autumn season. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher (30) to account for the high volatility observed during regime shifts, helping the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Autumn surge started P26, reaching 106 units in P29 (+340% from P26). This is a seasonal peak follows the summer trough.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn peak for the 'Period tote', following a deep summer trough. Demand in the last four periods has been 52, 69, 106, and 84 units, averaging 77.75 units per period. This is a dramatic increase from the summer average of ~6. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and while I have 290 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 28, 29, and 30), I am currently losing all sales due to stockouts. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since the first large recovery order (64 units from P28) isn't expected until P32 (next period), I must ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover the ongoing high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~77.75 * 5 = 388) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak sustained: Period 27-30 average demand is 77.75 units, a significant and sustained recovery from the summer trough (~6 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Period tote has entered an autumn peak regime starting in Period 26. Since Period 28, demand has consistently exceeded 60 units (69, 106, 84, 87), averaging 86.5 units over the last 4 periods. This is a significant shift from the summer trough (~6 units). Currently, the SKU is stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 394 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P8, P14-P22) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since my last order was in P28, I expect the first arrival of this new cycle in the 'conclude' message of P33 (read in P34), which means I must survive on in-transit stock until then. To stabilize the OR engine for this high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn peak. For lead time, I'm using 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been very stable.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime sustained: Period 28-31 demand average is 86.5 units, representing a full recovery and peak after the summer seasonal low.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in a sustained autumn peak regime starting around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) has been 69, 106, 84, 87, and 68 units, respectively, yielding an average of approximately 83 units per period. This shift follows the summer seasonal low (~6 units/period). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P32 of the order placed in P28. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 after P32's demand, and despite a total in-transit pipeline of 398 units, the next arrival (from P29) is not expected until P33's arrival phase (visible in P34 START). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent high-demand regime while the OR backend manages the safety stock and ordering cap based on the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime characterized: Periods 28-32 average demand is 82.8 units (Range: 68-106), representing a 13x increase from summer trough levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in a sustained autumn peak regime. The most recent demand in Period 33 spiked to 149 units, the highest recorded to date. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is approximately 98.8 units, compared to the earlier autumn average of ~82 units. Due to the high stockout risk reflected by the zero ending inventory in three of the last five periods and the recent demand spike, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use a recent_N of 5 to capture this heightened activity. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P28 and P29). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak period. This aggressive setting targets a high service level to prevent further stockouts during what appears to be a major seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak surge intensified: Period 33 demand reached a record high of 149 units; the 5-period average (P29-P33) has risen to 98.8 units, up from the previous peak average of ~82 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Period tote' continues in its autumn peak regime. Period 33 saw a record high of 149 units, followed by a slight moderation to 78 units in Period 34. The 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 93 units. Given the seasonality of a 'sturdy, grained imitation leather' handbag, high demand is expected to persist through October. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 62 and high demand leading to stockouts in P32-P33, the goal is to maintain a higher base stock. We use recent_N (N=7, covering the start of the autumn surge from P28) to capture the current high-demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Period 30-34 average demand is 92.8 units (Range: 78-149), maintaining the high-demand state established in late August.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an autumn peak regime. The current date is October 14, 2019. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 86.8 units (87, 68, 149, 78, 70), showing high volatility but sustained volume compared to the summer trough. The latest demand (70) and previous (78) suggest the record high of 149 in P33 may have been an outlier or the peak of the surge, but demand remains robust. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 96 units following the arrival of the P31 order. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 346 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand autumn regime while allowing for the recent stabilization after the P33 spike. Setting L to default (4) as the observed lead times match the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime shows stabilization: Period 31-35 average demand is 86.8 units, slightly down from the 98.8 average seen at the end of September but remaining 14x higher than summer levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Period tote has entered an autumn peak regime. While the extreme surge of Period 33 (149 units) has subsided, demand remains high and stable, with the last five periods (P32-P36) averaging 85.8 units (68, 149, 78, 70, 64). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the entirety of the recovery and peak regime (starting from P28) without over-reacting to the single P33 outlier. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P32-P36). Current on-hand is 100, and in-transit is 352, which covers the expected demand for the next L+1 periods based on the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime shows consolidation: Period 32-36 demand average is 85.8 units, confirming a high but slightly lower stability point compared to the late-September peak of 98.8.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (Period tote) is in its autumn peak regime. Current date is late October (2019-10-28). Historically, after the initial spring peaks (Feb), demand stabilized. Looking at the recent autumn surge which started around Period 26, demand peaked at 149 in Period 33 but has moderated over the last four periods (Period 34-37: 78, 70, 64, 68). The 5-period average (P33-P37) is 83.8 units. Although the average is stabilizing, we are entering the pre-holiday season, and 'Womens Big accessories' often see sustained or increased demand through November. On-hand inventory is 78 with a heavy pipeline of 336 units (orders from P34-P37), meaning many units are arriving in the next 1-4 periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most recent stable high-demand window) to ensure base stock targets are calibrated to this ~84 units/period level. Sigma remains calculated from the same window to capture recent volatility (range 64-149).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime shows a secondary stability phase: Period 34-37 average demand is 70 units (Range: 64-78), down from the late-September surge of 149 but significantly higher than the spring baseline (~40).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Period tote) is in its autumn peak regime. Current demand remains strong, with Period 38 jumping to 90 units, up from the previous 4-period average of 70. This suggests the autumn peak is not yet fading as we move into November, possibly heading toward a holiday/pre-winter plateau. Lead times are consistently holding at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 139, but demand is volatile (Range: 64-149). Since Period 34, the average demand is 73 units per period (N=5). To ensure high service levels while respecting the OR backend's inventory balancing, I am using the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) as the basis for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculate the base stock for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak continues into November: Period 38 demand reached 90 units, suggesting sustained high demand (Avg P34-P38 = 73) compared to the October average of 70.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (639448001) has transitioned from an autumn peak of nearly 150 units to a more stable but high-demand phase. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 77 units, and the average over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 74.5 units. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 143 units, with 154 units in-transit (P36: 74, P37: 30, P38: 83, P39: 0 - note: P35's 81 units arrived in P39). I'm setting N=6 for demand forecasting to capture the current post-peak stabilization level (avg ~75), which is higher than the spring baseline (~40) but lower than the September surge. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the OR backend adjusts to this specific late-autumn regime while maintaining a sufficient service level for the holiday run-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: Period 34-39 average demand has leveled at 74.5 units (Range: 64-90), reflecting a sustained high-demand regime following the late-September peak of 149.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the 'Period tote' has stabilized into an 'autumn peak' regime following a major surge in September. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 72.3 units (Range: 59-90). This represents a consistent level of high demand as we approach the end of the year. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 158 and pipeline inventory (in-transit) at 173, the total inventory position is 331 units. Given (L+1) = 5, the current position covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the 72.3 average. To maintain a safe service level during this sustained high-demand period while accounting for the recent slight softening (from the 90s to the 70s), I will use the recent_N method based on the 7-period stabilization period (N=7). This allows the OR engine to capture the current mean (~72) and variance of this specific regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the 'Period tote' remains in the high-demand autumn regime that began in late August. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand has been 72.5 units (Range: 59-90). This is remarkably stable compared to the late-September peak of 149. Lead times are consistently 4 periods. With 110 units on-hand and 193 in-transit (P38: 83, P40: 60, P41: 50), the current pipeline matches the expected arrivals for the next few periods. Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (total 47 periods), I will maintain parameters that cover the remaining horizon without over-ordering. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the stabilized autumn demand average and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at a late-season average of ~72.5 units (Periods 34-41), down from the burst peak of 149 in late September but sustained through November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Period tote' (639448001) experienced a massive holiday-related spike in Period 42 (2019/11/25), reaching 221 units, which corresponds to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This spike depleted all on-hand inventory. Historically, demand following this peak tends to remain elevated but levels off as the season approaches late December. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P34-P42) is 88.9 units, but excluding the outlier peak of 221, the average is 72.4 units. Given we are now in early December, I expect demand to remain high but stabilize below the extreme peak. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the broader autumn/early winter regime while reflecting the current high-volatility environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to rebuild inventory to meet December demand while accounting for the high \u03c3\u0302 caused by the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 221 units (+200% over the Nov average), signaling the peak retail window.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Dec 9). Period 42 showed a massive holiday spike (221 units), but Period 43 demand dropped back to 18 units, likely due to a stockout (on-hand was 0). The product is a 'Spacious handbag', a classic gift item. History shows lead times are stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 363 units (ordered in P40, P41, P42, P43), but current on-hand is 0. To prevent further lost sales during the peak December/January window, I must set the forecast to capture the high-demand regime. The Period 42 spike suggests a potential for recurring high volume. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the late-autumn average (~75) plus a buffer for the festive season, targeting a base stock that accounts for 'L+1' (5) periods. I estimate demand to average 120 units per period for the next 4 weeks to cover potential late-December peaks and January clearance/activity.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak observed Period 42 (221 units). Period 43 demand (18) likely suppressed by zero on-hand inventory. Expecting continued high volatility through Dec/Jan.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), right in the heart of the holiday retail peak. Looking at the history, Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (221 units). Periods 43 and 44 show low demand (18 and 14), but these are misleading because on-hand inventory was zero or near-zero, and the backend often reports suppressed sales as demand when stockouts occur. Given the seasonality of a 'Period tote' (fashion/handbag), high demand is expected through December and early January. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 40 order arrived in Period 44). The in-transit pipeline is huge (534 units), including orders from Period 41 (50), Period 42 (81), Period 43 (172), and Period 44 (231). These are expected to arrive in Period 45, 46, 47, and 48 respectively. Because the game ends at Period 47, we must be careful not to over-order for inventory that won't arrive or won't be sold. However, to maximize current service levels for the potential Christmas/New Year peak, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent peak demand (~150-200 units/period) while acknowledging the massive pipeline. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a high target stock level to capture remaining holiday demand, while relying on the OR backend's capping mechanism to prevent excessive over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand suppressed in Periods 43-44 due to stockouts; underlying demand remains high (referenced by P42 spike of 221). Simulation end (P47) is approaching, requiring careful management of the 534-unit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the final period P47. The holiday demand spike was clearly observed in Period 42 (221 units). Subsequent low demand (P43: 18, P44: 14, P45: 24) is likely due to stockouts or post-peak volatility, but historical data from the start of the year (Jan/Feb) suggests demand remains high (86-118 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is very high (775 units), including large orders from P43 (172), P44 (231), and P45 (291). Because orders placed now (P46) with a lead time of 4 will arrive in Period 50 (after the simulation ends at P47), any new order will only incur holding costs without contributing to revenue. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to essentially zero using the explicit method to prevent the OR engine from placing additional unnecessary orders, effectively tapering off the pipeline for the game conclusion.

Carry-over insight: End of simulation management: Orders placed from P44 onwards will arrive after P47 (due to L=4), so order quantities should be minimized to avoid end-of-game holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-128.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Final Period). In this simulation, any order placed in the decision phase of Period 47 will have its arrival scheduled for Period 51 (given L=4), which is far beyond the game's conclusion. Per the objective of maximizing total reward (Profit * Units Sold - Holding Cost * Ending Inventory), placing an order now would only result in potential zero benefit if the game stops tracking at Period 47, or excessive holding costs if it continues. There are 148 units on-hand and 694 units in-transit (81 from P42 arrived this period, but orders from P43-P45 totaling 694 units are still in the pipeline). Since the simulation is ending, I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent the OR engine from generating an unnecessary final order, thereby protecting the net profit from additional holding costs.
