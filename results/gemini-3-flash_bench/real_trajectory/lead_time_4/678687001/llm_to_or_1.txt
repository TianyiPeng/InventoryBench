Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a sports bra (Karin Sports Bra). Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a mean of approximately 111.2 units per week (118, 136, 104, 95, 103). There is no obvious seasonal spike in these 5 weeks of winter data, though sports apparel often sees a 'New Year' bump which might be tapering off. On-hand and In-transit are currently 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no specific evidence of lead time deviation yet, I will use the default promised lead time. For demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent local demand average (111.2) over the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Sigma will also be calculated based on the recent 5 samples to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'KARIN SPORTS BRA', a sports accessory likely seeing steady demand. Looking at historical demand (118, 136, 104, 95, 103, and now 99 in Period 1), the demand is relatively stable but shows a slight declining trend over the last 4 weeks. The mean of all 6 samples is ~109.16. Promised lead time (L) is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 138 units, which are currently in-transit. Since L=4, we expect this arrival in Period 5. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and lost all 99 units of demand in Period 1. To recover and ensure we cover the 5-period window (L+1), I will use the recent demand trend (N=5 excluding the latest slightly lower 99, or just using all samples) to set parameters. Given the stockout, the priority is to build inventory. I'll use the 'default' calculation for mu_hat based on the historical mean (~109) to avoid overreacting to the single low data point of 99.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a sports bra SKU. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of 111.2. Recent actual demand in Periods 1 and 2 was 99 and 141 (mean 120), indicating a slight upward trend as we move towards spring/fitness season. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 273 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals are expected until Period 5. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the recent trend including the historical data and early game observations. Lead time (L) is set to default (4) as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a Karin Sports Bra, a fast-drying functional item. The historical demand samples (roughly 111 average) and game history demands (99, 141, 117) suggest a stable demand regime, though we are currently experiencing a total stockout (on-hand = 0, sold = 0). As of Period 4, we have seen no arrivals yet, which is expected given the promised lead time of 4 periods. The first order placed in Period 1 (ordered=138) should arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message, available at the start of Period 6). Since we have no completed arrivals to calculate actual lead time, I will stick to the 'default' lead time (4 periods). Total in-transit is 418 units (138 + 135 + 145), which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the historical average. Demand remains relatively stable; I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture both the provided pre-game samples and the 3 game-history samples, as this provides a representative snapshot of the current 'Jersey Fancy' category demand entering the spring season.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a sports bra (KARIN SPORTS BRA), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by fitness trends. Current demand samples reflect a mean of approximately 115 units per week (99, 141, 117, 112). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a significant pipeline of 561 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which we will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that we have seen 0 arrivals so far. I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) and use the recent demand samples (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the startup phase demand is the most relevant indicator right now.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are [118, 136, 104, 95, 103], and recent game history demand (Periods 1-5) is [99, 141, 117, 112, 118]. The mean demand across all 10 available data points is approximately 114.4. Lead time calculation: The Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory check: On-hand is 20, and In-transit is 513 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Total pipeline is 533 units. Since L=4, the pipeline should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. 533 units / 114.4 avg demand = 4.66 periods of cover, which is slightly low but the OR backend cap will manage the order size. No significant regime shift or seasonal spike is evident yet for mid-March, so I will use a recent_N strategy to weight the most recent realized demand slightly more.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a sports bra. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been stable around 110-120 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Concluded shipments from Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (Period 5 and 6 respectively), confirming the actual lead time L=4. Current on-hand is 55 units, and in-transit is 488 (representing orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Demand in the last two periods (118, 100) is consistent with previous patterns. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent stability, and default for lead time as the promised 4 periods align with observations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This keeps the base stock calculated across 5 periods (L+1) to ensure we cover demand while the pipeline replenishes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6). Demand regime remains stable around 110-120 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a sports bra, which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand in spring as people prepare for warmer weather and exercise. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a mean of 115.7 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (promised lead time). Based on the 7 available historical samples (99, 141, 117, 112, 118, 100, 123), the 'default' or 'recent_N' methods are appropriate. I've chosen N=7 to capture all available data since the demand regime has been stable. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 443) + On-hand (77) = 520 units. With L=4, we are covering approximately 4.5 periods of demand, which aligns with the (L+1) requirement to cover current and lead time demand. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the OR backend uses the observed local stability while accounting for recent variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a Karin Sports Bra. Historically, demand has been stable (~110-120), but Period 8 saw a significant jump to 182 units. This aligns with early April, often a period where spring/summer sports apparel demand begins to increase. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 8 (all arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering). On-hand inventory is currently low (38 units) because of the recent demand spike, while in-transit inventory is healthy (412 units). Given the sudden jump in demand, I will move from a global average to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the upward trend while maintaining the default lead time (L=4). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) will account for the increased volatility seen in the last period to ensure a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 8 (182 units vs previous avg ~115) potentially signaling the start of a spring/summer seasonal regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand shows a baseline of ~115 units, but we observed a significant spike to 182 units in Period 8 (April 1st), followed by a return to 101 units in Period 9. Given the early April timing, the spike might be a pre-Easter or spring fitness surge. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The pipeline is currently 510 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Expected arrivals in upcoming periods are: P10 (P6 order: 110), P11 (P7 order: 100), P12 (P8 order: 112), P13 (P9 order: 188). Current on-hand is low (27). To handle the volatility seen in P8 and the shift into spring, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. I will set N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the higher average (avg of P5-P9 is ~125), ensuring we don't under-order if another spike occurs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a Sports Bra, which typically sees increased demand during spring and summer (active seasons). Demand analysis shows a spike in Period 8 (182) followed by a dip in P10 (85), but the overall volume remains higher than the initial February/March levels. Total demand over the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 368 (avg 122.6), while the previous 7-period average was 116. Given the seasonality potential, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher mean (avg 118.2) while buffering for the variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 52, with 580 in-transit. A pipeline of 580 units against an expected lead-time demand (L+1=5 periods) of roughly 600 units is appropriate. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize the most recent demand regime shift.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th. We are seeing a shift in demand patterns. After a spike in Period 8 (182 units), demand in the last three periods (P9-P11) averaged 95 units, which is lower than the initial baseline (approx. 115). This suggests the Period 8 spike was an isolated event (likely a spring promotion or early season peak) rather than a sustained regime shift to higher demand. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently confirmed by all 7 arriving shipments to date. On-hand inventory is 53, with 580 units in transit (ordered P8-P11). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the potential summer season, I will use a recent demand window of 4 periods (P8-P11) which captures the high outlier and the subsequent dip, averaging 116.75 units per period. This balances the risk of another spike against the recent lower sales. I will use the established Lead Time of 4. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+4) * 116.75 = 583.75.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spike: Period 8 (182 units) appears to be a transitory peak; Periods 9-11 show a lower mean of 95 units/period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The demand for product 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) has stabilized following a transitory spike in Period 8. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 94.5 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P8. Pipeline inventory (581 units) is high relative to the current demand regime, largely due to response orders placed during P9 and P10. For Period 13, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (approx 95 units/period). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals strongly support the 4-period lead time. I'll use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current stability after the P8 peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra has stabilized at a lower level following a transitory spike in Period 8. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), average demand has been approximately 91.4 units per week, compared to the earlier season average of ~115. Current on-hand inventory is 181, with a substantial pipeline of 393 units (orders from P10-P12). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N where N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the recent deceleration and lower volatility in demand, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the earlier historical mean or the outlier in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~91 units/week (Periods 9-13) compared to pre-spike mean of ~115 (-20% shift).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1479.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is high (On-hand: 269, In-transit: 213) with 180 units having just arrived in Period 14. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~91 units/week (Periods 9-14: 101, 85, 99, 93, 79, 92) compared to the pre-spike period. This is approximately an 18% decrease from the original mean of ~115 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high stock levels (covering over 2 weeks of demand on-hand and another 2 weeks in pipeline), the backend's capped policy will likely keep orders at zero or very low until the inventory is digested. For parameters, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat specifically covering the post-spike stabilized regime (N=6, Periods 9-14) to avoid bias from the Period 8 spike (182 units) while accurately reflecting the current lower demand trend. This allows the backend to adjust the base stock down, reducing unnecessary holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a Sports Bra SKU. Historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods. After a demand spike in Period 8 (182 units), the demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), the average demand is 92.0 units per period, while the most recent 3 periods (P13-P15) show an average of 88.6 units. The product's seasonality (Sportswear in late May) suggests stable demand before any potential summer vacation shifts. Current On-hand (274) + In-transit (120) equals 394 units. For a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~90, required base stock is approximately 450-500 units. Since on-hand is high, the OR backend will likely order a small amount. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime established since Period 9, and 'default' for L as the promised 4-period lead time is consistently met.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a Sports Bra, which typically sees consistent demand throughout the spring and early summer. Historical demand analysis shows a stable regime since Period 9 (late April), following a transitory peak in Period 8. Over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), the average demand is approximately 92.6 units (101, 85, 99, 93, 79, 92, 95, 97). Demand has been very stable recently, with the last 4 periods averaging 90.75 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower mean while maintaining enough variance for safety. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 16). The system currently has high on-hand inventory (290 units) due to large orders arriving from Periods 9 and 10, which exceeds the projected demand for the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). However, since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy and the in-transit quantity is low (102), providing accurate stats will allow the OR engine to naturally throttle the order to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 9 to 16: avg approx 93 units/week, significantly lower than the pre-peak average of ~115 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18 (2019/6/10). The demand regime has been highly stable since Period 9, following a transitory spike in Period 8. The average demand from Period 9 to 17 (9 samples) is approximately 92.2 units per week, which is roughly 20% lower than the early February-March average (~115). Period 17 conclude shows 0 units arrived, but this is consistent with the fact that zero units were ordered in Period 13; therefore, the supply chain remains reliable at a 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently high at 204 units, while 201 units are in transit (ordered in Periods 15, 16, and 17). To optimize for the Backend OR, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained lower demand regime (\u03bc \u2248 92). The lead time remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19 (2019/06/17). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand analysis shows a stable regime from Period 9 to Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 93.8 units/week (9 periods: 101, 85, 99, 93, 79, 92, 95, 97, 86, 101). The spike in Period 8 (182 units) was a transitory event. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods for all orders that have arrived (Periods 1-12). However, orders from Period 13 (ordered=0) and Period 14 (ordered=0) naturally resulted in no arrivals in Periods 17 and 18. The order from Period 15 (7 units) is expected to arrive in Period 19, and the order from Period 16 (95 units) in Period 20. Currently, on-hand inventory is 103 and in-transit is 283. Since the demand regime has been stable for 10 periods (N=10), I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand level (~94/week) compared to the start of the year. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20 (late June). The KARIN SPORTS BRA is in a stable demand regime that shifted lower after a transitory peak in Period 8. Historically, demand from Period 9 to 19 has averaged ~91 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Orders from Period 13 (ordered 0) and Period 14 (ordered 0) explain the lack of arrivals in Periods 17 and 18. The arrival in Period 19 was the result of the small order in Period 15. We expect the orders from Periods 16-19 to begin arriving from Period 20 onwards. Since the demand has been stable for 11 periods (P9-P19), I will use recent_N with N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for the 4-period lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand analysis: Since Period 9 (excluding the outlier in Period 8), demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Comparing the pre-peak average (~115) to the last 12 periods (approx 88 units/week), there is a clear downward shift. The last two periods (P19: 72, P20: 67) suggest a potential further cooling, but I will use the recent regime (last 12 periods) to maintain stability. Lead Time analysis: Arrival history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (P15 arrived in P19, P16 arrived in P20). Orders from P13 and P14 (which were 0 units) passed their arrival window in P17 and P18, explaining the 'arrived=0' messages during those periods. On-hand inventory is 66, with 357 units in-transit (P17-P20 orders: 99+82+105+71). For parameters: L is set to default (4). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained lower demand since April. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=12) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized at a lower mean (~88 units/week) from Period 9 through 20 compared to the initial Feb-Mar period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is July 8th (Period 22). The 'KARIN SPORTS BRA' is currently in a stable demand regime that began around Period 9. The most recent demand samples show a downward trend (Periods 19-21: 72, 67, 50), significantly lower than the ~90 level seen in May/June. This might reflect a mid-summer cooling or the end of a seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, we have 115 units on-hand and 322 in transit. Pipeline inventory (437) is quite high relative to recent demand. For the OR parameters: L is set to 'default' (4), mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering Period 9 to present) to capture the lower post-April regime mean, and sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=13 to account for the current regime's volatility. This ensures the OR logic doesn't over-order into a potential summer slowdown while accounting for the established 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease detected: Average demand from Period 19-21 dropped to approx 63 units/week, down from the ~90 units/week seen in the preceding 10 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) has entered a clear downward trend as we move further into July, likely marking the end of the peak spring/early summer fitness season. Demand has plummeted from an average of ~90 units/week to a very low 25 units in Period 22. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have demand values of 67, 50, and 25, clearly showing a continuous decline. My goal is to prevent significant inventory buildup by adjusting the forecast quickly to this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently high at 172 units, and pipeline inventory (289 units) is also significant relative to this new low-demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the OR engine to use these lower, more recent demand samples (avg ~47 units), which will naturally lower the base stock level and slow down ordering to avoid holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Significant downtrend starting Period 20, with Period 22 demand falling to 25 units (approx -70% vs the Period 9-19 average).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) has entered a clear downward trend starting around Period 20 (late June). After stabilizing around 90 units/week during May and early June, the demand fell sharply in July, with the last three periods recording 50, 25, and 37 units respectively. This drop is likely seasonal as mid-summer begins. The current on-hand inventory (240 units) plus the in-transit pipeline (184 units) totaling 424 units is extremely high relative to the recent demand mean of approximately 37 units (average of last 3 periods). Orders from Periods 20, 21, and 22 are expected to arrive in Periods 24, 25, and 26. Given the stable observed lead time of 4 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To allow the inventory level to deflate and avoid excessive holding costs, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent sharp decline (approx 44.75 units/period), and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline confirmed (mid-summer): Average demand decreased from ~90 to ~45 units/week (-50%) since Period 20.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra is experiencing a significant late-summer demand decline. Recent demand samples for Periods 21-24 are 50, 25, 37, and 35 units respectively, yielding an average of approx 37 units/week. This represents a -60% drop from the mid-year average of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (276 units) relative to this new demand level, and we have 113 units in-transit (orders from P21 and P22). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the shift starting P20) and setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently returned to the promised 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory combined with the incoming pipeline will likely result in the OR backend placing zero or very small orders until inventory is right-sized for the current demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are seeing a significant and sustained seasonal decline in demand for this sports bra as summer progresses. Demand has dropped from a spring average of ~90 units/week to an average of just 32 units/week over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), with a recent low of 13 units in P25. Current on-hand inventory is 327 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 10 weeks of inventory\u2014far exceeding the lead time requirements. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the low demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the summer downturn while maintaining L at calculate. The OR backend will likely generate zero orders until the inventory level aligns with this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand decline: Average demand from Period 20-25 dropped to ~32 units/week, down from ~90 (-64%). Period 25 demand (13 units) confirms a significant seasonal low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained late-summer demand decline for the KARIN SPORTS BRA. The demand has dropped significantly from the spring/summer average of ~90 units/week to an average of ~32 units/week over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), with the most recent sample at 25 units. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our on-hand inventory is currently very high at 351 units, which is more than enough to cover over 10 periods of demand at current levels (351 / 32 \u2248 11 weeks). Since the review period plus lead time (1+L) is only 5 weeks, the system should not place any new orders. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's calculated base stock remains below our current inventory to prevent unnecessary holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are observing a significant and sustained seasonal decline in demand for the Karin Sports Bra. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~115 units early in the year and a stabilized ~90 units in Q2 to an average of just ~28 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 23-27: 37, 35, 13, 25, 36). Current on-hand inventory is very high at 315 units, which covers over 10 periods of current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high carry-over of inventory and the low demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this downward trend while maintaining safety. The OR backend will likely recommend zero orders until inventory levels normalize against this new demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal low confirmed: Average demand from Period 23-27 is 29.2 units, a ~68% decrease from the Q2 stabilized mean of ~91 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) remains in a sustained seasonal low period. Average demand over the last 9 periods (P20 to P28) is approximately 37 units/week, with the most recent 5 periods (P24 to P28) averaging 30.6 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 271 units with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand throughout the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 weeks), given the current mean of ~31. Choosing N=9 for demand estimation captures the regime shift that started around late June/early July. Since on-hand inventory already significantly exceeds the likely base stock requirements for this low-demand regime, the goal is to avoid further ordering and minimize holding costs while the current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal low (P20-P28): Mean approx 37 units/week, representing a ~60% reduction from the spring plateau.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-02 (Period 30). The demand for the KARIN SPORTS BRA has settled into a significant late-summer/seasonal low. Analyzing the demand from Period 20 to 29, the mean is approximately 38 units/week, a sharp decrease from the ~90 units/week seen earlier in the year. The current on-hand inventory is 226 units with 0 in-transit. Given the mean demand of ~38, the current stock covers approximately 6 periods of demand, which is sufficient given the lead time of 4 periods. The arrivals for orders from Periods 13, 14, 15 (which were mostly zero or very low) have either occurred or passed, and no further large shipments are expected based on the recent order history of '0' for the last several periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this consolidated low-demand regime (Periods 20-29), ensuring the inventory levels gradually normalize without over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product (Sports Bra) reached a seasonal demand low in late July and August. However, current demand (P30: 29 units, P29: 45 units, P28: 44 units) suggests a slight stabilization or very early recovery from the absolute minimum (P25: 13 units). The on-hand inventory is 197 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (avg ~35 units/period). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods. The current pipeline (on-hand 197 + in-transit 18 = 215) covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~35/period). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for potentially recovering autumn demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the seasonal trough while allowing for the slight upward trend seen in the last three weeks (avg 39.3). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility of this seasonal low.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra has stabilized at a significantly lower seasonal level. Period 31 demand was 28 units, following a stable trend where the mean demand from Period 20 to 31 is approximately 38 units/week. Since Period 28, the average is even lower at ~36 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 169 units, which covers approximately 4-5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With 169 units on-hand and 18 units in-transit (total 187), the inventory position is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time demand (estimated at ~180-190 units). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the low-demand regime starting from Period 20, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the earlier high-demand spring/summer periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra continues to exhibit a sustained seasonal low-demand regime throughout late Q3 (mid-August to late September). Demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) has averaged ~31.25 units/week, drastically lower than the Q2 average of ~90. The current date is September 23, typically a transition period into autumn, but demand remains flat (20 units in Period 32). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (last arrived P26). With 149 units on-hand and 64 in-transit, we have 213 units of total pipeline inventory. At the current demand rate of ~31 units per week, this covers nearly 7 weeks of demand, which exceeds the required coverage for the lead time (L+1 = 5 weeks). Therefore, the system will naturally taper ordering. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the last 13 periods (from Period 20 onwards) as this excludes the older high-demand regime, ensuring parameters are aligned with the current low seasonal baseline while allowing for slight variance.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra is currently in a seasonal low during the late summer/early autumn transition. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the spring peak. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), mean demand is 33.6 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals, though recent orders are still in transit (Orders from P30, P32, and P33). Current on-hand inventory is 103 units, which provides approximately 3 periods of cover at current demand levels. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 78 units brings the total inventory position to 181 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods and a holding cost of $1/unit, we need to maintain a lean base stock. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~34) while allowing for slight volatility, ensuring we don't over-order as we move deeper into autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability at seasonal low confirmed: Mean demand from Period 28 to 33 is approx 35 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra (SKU: 678687001) has stabilized at a seasonal low following a significant decline that began around Period 20. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 24 units, and the average since Period 28 is approximately 32 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, as the P30 order arrived in P34. Given the current date of October 7th and the product type (fast-drying sports bra), we are firmly in a low-demand autumn regime. On-hand inventory (97) plus in-transit (81) totals 178 units. With a lead time of 4 and a review period of 1, we must cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean (~32 units), required inventory is approximately 160 units. The pipeline is currently sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=7, covering periods 28-34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current low-demand stability while maintaining the 4-period lead time parameter.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The Karin Sports Bra has entered a sustained low-demand regime since late summer (Period 20 onwards). While the spring/early summer average was ~90 units/week, the average demand from Period 20 to 35 is approximately 35.6 units/week. Recent demand (Periods 30-35) remains low with an average of 27.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Total pipeline (on-hand 78 + in-transit 112 = 190) currently covers over 6 weeks of recent demand, but as older stock is depleted, we need to maintain a lean base stock to avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase. I will use recent_N (N=15) to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The Karin Sports Bra has entered a sustained low-demand regime since late summer (Period 20). Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand has been 31.0 units (36, 44, 45, 29, 28, 20, 46, 24, 19, 20), which is consistent with the 'seasonal low' noted in the carry-over insights. Recent demand data shows even lower figures (averaging ~23 over the last 3 periods), but the 10-period average provides a more stable base for the OR engine given the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 76) and on-hand inventory (104) are currently high relative to this demand level, which will result in low or zero orders to minimize holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stabilized seasonal low mean and variance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (Sports Bra) has been in a sustained seasonal low-demand regime since late summer (Period 20). Analyzing the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is 33.9 units, which is consistent with the established seasonal low of approx 35 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P34, P36, P37). On-hand inventory is 64 and in-transit is 78, totaling 142 units. This covers roughly 4.2 periods of current demand. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. The OR engine parameters are set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime and current lead time observations, ensuring we maintain a sufficient base stock for the 5-period horizon while minimizing holding costs on a low-velocity item.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are entering the late fall season for this sports bra SKU. Demand has been stabilized at a seasonal low since Period 20, but the most recent 6 periods (P33-P38) show a slight uptick in mean demand (approx 33 units/week) compared to the deep summer low, with higher volatility (P37 demand was 54). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by recent arrivals from P30, P32, P33, and P34). Current on-hand is 48, with 112 in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, P38). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the slight uptick in recent demand and volatility while maintaining a conservative buffer for the end-of-year period. L will remain at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a seasonal low regime but has shown a slight increase in volatility and mean (avg ~33 units) over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) compared to the mid-summer lows.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, heading toward the end of Q4. Demand history shows a seasonal low from late summer through mid-October (avg ~30 units), but the last 3 periods (P37-P39) show a notable increase in sales (54, 37, 46) and volatility. This likely signals a pre-holiday or early-winter uptick for functional sports apparel. With a promised and confirmed lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now arrive in mid-December (Period 44). I will adapt mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) to capture this rising trend (avg ~35 units) while setting sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility. In-transit inventory (139) plus on-hand (33) is 172 units, which covers roughly 4-5 weeks of current demand, but needs to be maintained to handle potential holiday spikes. Reconciled L=4 is consistent with recent arrivals (P34, P36, P37, P38, P39 all confirmed L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 37: 5-period avg increased to ~35 units with higher volatility (peak 54), suggesting a pre-holiday demand recovery from summer lows.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), approaching the holiday season. Historical demand for this sports bra showed a significant recovery starting Period 37, with demand increasing from summer lows (~35 units) to more variable levels (peaks of 54, 46). The last 5 periods (P36-P40) demand was: 20, 54, 37, 46, 29, averaging 37.2 units. Given the seasonality of sports apparel (pre-holiday fitness trends and gifting), I expect this recovery to continue or accelerate slightly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived P40). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current upward trend and volatility effectively while ignoring the deep summer slump. Lead time will remain at 'default' (4 periods). This setup ensures the base stock covers (4+1)=5 weeks of demand at the recovered rate.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand recovery trend confirmed: 5-period average (P36-P40) is 37.2 units, up from the summer low of ~33 units. Volatility has also increased during this period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (Nov 25), leading into the December holiday season. Historical demand shows a recovery trend from summer lows, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) being 38.4 units and reaching a peak of 54. Given the product is a 'sports bra in fast-drying functional fabric', we anticipate a potential secondary spike in late December/early January for 'New Year' resolutions, though the immediate focus is maintaining stock for the year-end shopping period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (4 units), but there are 206 units in transit. The next arrival (ordered P38) is expected this period. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased variance observed in the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand recovery trend continues through P41: 5-period average (P37-P41) is 38.4 units, confirming a shift from the summer low regime (~33 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike of 136 units, which is a clear structural break from the previous 'holiday recovery' average of ~38 units. This spike coincides with the start of December and likely Cyber Monday/holiday shopping peaks for the 'Jersey Fancy' sports bra. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in P42. Although 165 units are in-transit (ordered P39-P42), the current base stock must be adjusted immediately to reflect this new high-demand regime to prevent further lost sales. I am choosing N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating trend (P38-P42 avg is ~55), but given the P42 spike, I'll use N=3 to weight the most recent surge more heavily in volatility (sigma_hat) calculation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P38 order arrived P42).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Significant seasonal spike detected (136 units), likely driven by December holiday/Cyber Monday sales, shifting the mean from ~38 to a high-volatility peak regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive demand spike (136 units) coinciding with late November (Cyber Monday/Black Friday), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (18 units). This confirms a high-volatility holiday regime. On-hand inventory is 40, with 265 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, arrivals for the next few periods are: P44: 61 units (ordered P40), P45: 32 units (ordered P41), P46: 14 units (ordered P42), P47: 158 units (ordered P43). Given the proximity to the Christmas/New Year period (P45-P47), demand may spike again. I will set mu_hat to capture the recent holiday volatility and the expected seasonal peak by using the explicit method. I'll estimate the average demand across the review and lead time (L+1=5 periods) as 350 units (avg ~70/week), which accounts for both the recent spike and the potential for a pre-end-of-game surge, while setting sigma_hat explicitly high to handle the observed holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed P42-P43: high volatility with extreme peak (136) followed by low (18). Expected to remain volatile through end of year (P47).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 45 of 47). Current date is Dec 16. The product is a sports bra, which saw a major holiday spike in P42 (136 units) followed by a return to lower, though volatile, demand in P43-P44 (18 and 32 units). The goal now is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory, as the game ends at P47. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P45) will arrive in P49 (after the game ends). Therefore, the 'In-transit' inventory (359 units) and 'On-hand' inventory (69 units) are the only resources available to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (P45, P46, P47). Because any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends, the OR parameters should be set to prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a realistic base stock based on the recent holiday volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the recovery and holiday volatility (P39-P44) while letting the OR backend handle the stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Average demand P42-P44 is 62 units, significantly higher and more volatile than the P37-41 average of 38 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) shows the impact of a massive holiday demand spike in Period 45 (409 units), which completely depleted the stock (on-hand is 0). This follows a previous spike in Period 42 (136 units). We are now in a high-volatility, high-demand holiday regime. While the next period (P47) is likely the tail end of the holiday surge, the 409-unit demand indicates we must prepare for sustained higher volume than the summer lows. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P42-P45) to capture this new regime (avg ~148 units) and sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the extreme variance observed in the last 4 weeks (136, 18, 32, 409). Note: In-transit is high (327), with arrivals from P42 (ordered 14) expected in P46 and P43 (ordered 158) in P47, which should help recover the stock position.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime reached extreme peak in Period 45 (409 units), confirming a high-volume, high-volatility regime for Dec-Jan compared to the summer low (avg ~35).

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the December holiday demand regime. Demand in Period 45 was 409 and in Period 46 was 338, which is a massive surge compared to the annual average. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (573 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and current stockout situation, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume holiday peak (Periods 42-46) without being skewed by the much lower autumn demand. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that prioritizes recovering from the stockout and meeting the sustained holiday demand, even as we likely approach the end of the peak season in early January.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime reached peak significantly higher than initially expected: P45 (409) and P46 (338) confirm extreme volume. Inventory is currently depleted, necessitating aggressive restock parameters until the post-holiday drop is observed.
