Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Kai jumper'. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 152.6 units (106, 133, 203, 165, 156). Demand showed an uptick in late January but has stabilized around 150-160 in February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand average, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to provide a standard safety buffer for the (L+1) period cycle. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will be roughly median total demand over the lead time plus review period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's cotton-blend jumper. Historical demand shows a seasonal upward trend: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156. In Period 1, observed demand was 117. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order placed in Period 1 (213 units) is in-transit and won't arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest), we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales in Period 1. The demand mean of the 6 available samples (including P1) is 146.6. Given the product category (knitwear) and late February date, we are likely transitioning from peak winter to early spring, though demand remains relatively stable. I will use the current average demand to set parameters. L is set to default (4). mu_hat will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend of the last 6 available data points. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to account for recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing SKU 580770001 (Women's Knitwear Kai jumper). Demand data shows samples: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156 (pre-game) and 117, 109 (in-game), averaging approximately 144 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 weeks. Currently, on-hand is 0, and 419 units are in transit (orders from P1 and P2). The earliest these can arrive, per the lead time definition, is Period 5. Note that Period 4 still faces zero supply. Seasonal context: Late February/March often sees steady demand for transition knitwear. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and average demand to set the base stock level. mu_hat should cover L+1 = 5 periods. Mean demand (~144) * 5 = 720 units. I'll use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the OR engine's computation on the full historical sample (which is stable) while waiting for the first shipment arrival to calibrate lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product (Kai jumper) is a cotton-blend sweater, likely transitioning from late winter into spring. Historical demand (Jan: 106, 133, 203, 165; Feb: 156, 117, 109, 60) shows a significant downward trend as we move into March, likely due to warming weather. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (expected arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts because the initial on-hand was 0 and the lead time is long. Given the recent demand drop (last 3 periods: 117, 109, 60), I will use recent_N (N=4, including the last historical sample) to adjust mu_hat to the cooling demand, but I will stay slightly conservative to avoid excessive holding costs on a declining item. L set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to capture the lower demand regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a cotton-blend 'Kai jumper,' part of the Womens Everyday Collection. Demand has been declining significantly from ~117 in P1 to 38 in P4, following a high of 203 in late January. This suggests a post-winter seasonal drop for sweaters as we move into March. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders were placed in P1 (213), P2 (206), and P3 (200). Following the sequence (N+L), the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. Currently, on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 619. Given the sharp downward trend in demand, I will use a recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the falling mean (approx 69/week) rather than the all-time mean (~128/week). For L, I will stick with the promised 4 until a conclusion confirms otherwise. This strategy aims to prevent excessive overstocking as the sweater season winds down.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's cotton-blend boat-neck jumper. As we move from winter toward spring, demand has shown a decreasing trend (106, 133, 203, 165, 156 prior to game start; then 117, 109, 60, 38, 88 during game periods). The demand in Period 5 (88) reflects a slight pickup from the previous lows, perhaps due to early spring shopping. The first order (213 units from P1) arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). On-hand inventory is 125, and pipeline inventory is 406 (orders from P2 and P3). Since the lead time is confirmed as 4, and demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level than Jan/Feb peaks, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the contemporary lower demand regime while accounting for potential spring seasonality. L is set to calculated as it matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: average weekly demand dropped from ~150 to ~70 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a cotton blend jumper, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand for the first 5 weeks (early Feb) averaged 152.6, but recent weeks (Period 3-6) have seen a significant drop to an average of 57.75 units. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime (60, 38, 88, 45). The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Current on-hand inventory (286) plus in-transit (200 from P3) is 486 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~58, we have over 8 weeks of stock, which is excessive given the profit=cost=1.0 ratio (implying a 50% service level target). The OR backend's inventory cap will naturally prevent over-ordering, but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime is crucial for accurate base stock calculation.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's cotton blend sweater ('Kai jumper'). Demand has significantly cooled as we move into spring (April). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Periods 3-7) shows values of 60, 38, 88, 45, and 51, averaging approximately 56 units per week. This confirms the carry-over insight of a lower demand regime compared to the early-year samples (~150). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 435 units, which is extremely high (nearly 8 weeks of supply at current demand rates). No orders are in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower spring demand profile. Given the high stock, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's cotton blend jumper. From the history, we've confirmed the promised lead time L=4 is reliable (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently no units in-transit. A significant demand shift occurred around Period 3: prior mean was ~120, while the average demand from Period 3 to Period 8 is 58.1 [(60+38+88+45+51+67)/6]. The current on-hand inventory is 368 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~58, the 5-period demand is ~290. Our current inventory (368) already exceeds the required base stock levels given this demand regime. Therefore, the OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate given the surplus and equal profit/holding cost ratio ($1/$1). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the lower demand regime and use the default calculated lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P3-P8 stabilized at mean ~58 units/period, significantly lower than initial samples. Lead time consistently holds at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a soft cotton blend jumper (knitwear). Historically, demand for this item dropped significantly around Period 3 (February 25), coinciding with the end of peak winter. From Period 3 to Period 9, demand has averaged 55.7 units per period, which is much lower than the initial samples (avg ~153). Currently, we have 327 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a desired coverage of (L+1)=5 periods, our total needed inventory is approximately 5 * 56 = 280 units. Since on-hand (327) already exceeds this, even with a high service level requirement (Profit=Holding cost -> q=0.5 -> z=0), we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 7 periods) to prevent unnecessary ordering and allow inventory to bleed down. Lead time is stable at 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), we are managing a cotton-blend knit jumper. Historically, demand was higher in Jan/Feb (>150), but dropped significantly in mid-February (the 'Period 3' shift noted in carry-over). The recent demand (Periods 8-10) is 67, 41, and 26 respectively, averaging 44.6 units per week. This downward trend aligns with the product being a sweater (Knitwear) as the northern hemisphere moves into late spring. Our current on-hand inventory is 301 units, which is extremely high (nearly 7 weeks of supply at the current rate), while our pipeline is empty. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we want our base stock to equal the expected demand over (L+1) periods. L is 4, so (L+1)=5. Predicted demand for 5 periods is approximately 223 units (44.6 * 5). Our 301 on-hand units already exceed this, so we should not place any new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu) and sigma to capture this latest seasonal decline, which will result in a base_stock target lower than our current inventory, effectively stopping new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to decline as spring progresses; the average demand for the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is ~45 units/week, down from the ~58 average noted in P9.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend knitwear product. As we enter late April and move into May, demand is naturally declining due to warmer weather in the northern hemisphere. Historical data shows a clear shift: initial samples were 100-200+, but demand since Period 3 has dropped significantly. The last three periods (P9, P10, P11) show demand of 41, 26, and 25 units respectively. The average of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is approximately 39.75 units per week, but the most recent two weeks (P10-P11) suggest a stabilization or further dip around 25 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 276 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods (L=4), our look-ahead window is 5 periods (L+1). At a demand rate of ~25-40 units, 276 units covers nearly 7-11 weeks of demand, meaning we are significantly overstocked. Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), aiming to stock the mean. No order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the confirmed lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~25-40 units/week) as of late April, consistent with seasonal decline for knitwear.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper (knitwear), which is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand decline as spring progresses into summer. Demand in the last four periods (P9-P12) has averaged 34 units (41, 26, 25, 44), significantly lower than the ~58 average seen in late March and the initial arrivals phase. On-hand inventory is currently 232 units, which, at the recent demand rate of ~34/week, covers approximately 6.8 weeks of supply. Given the lead time is 4 periods, total coverage needs to span L+1 (5) periods. Since 232 > (5 * 34), we are in an overstock position relative to current seasonal trends. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower May demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived with L=4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which is experiencing a seasonal demand decline as spring progresses into summer. Demand has stabilized at a much lower level than the initial February peak; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 35.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 189 units with no in-transit orders. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (Review=1), our inventory needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~36 units, we need approximately 180 units (5 * 36) to cover the cycle. Since on-hand is 189, we are slightly overstocked but approaching a balanced state. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this lower seasonal demand regime while maintaining L=4 to satisfy the OR engine's lead time requirements.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a knitwear item. As recorded in previous insights, demand for this seasonal item has significantly declined since the peak in early February (~150 units/week) to a stabilized low-demand regime for the spring/summer months. For the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has averaged 35.2 units per week (26, 25, 44, 43, 38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 151 units on-hand and an expected weekly demand of ~35, we have over 4 weeks of inventory, which is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5). No new orders are needed immediately, but parameters must reflect the current regime to prevent over-ordering as inventory depletes. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods of demand and maintain the calculated lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton sweater (knitwear), which is in a seasonal decline as we approach summer. Historical demand from the last five periods (P11-P15) shows a stable but low average of 37.8 units per week (25, 44, 43, 38, 39). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on early gameplay history. With current on-hand inventory at 112 units and 25 units in-transit (ordered P15), total pipeline inventory is 137 units. At the recent average demand of ~38 units/week, 137 units covers approximately 3.6 weeks of demand, which is slightly below the (L+1) window of 5 weeks. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), the OR backend's service level target (z*) will be lower to avoid excess stock during this off-season. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (N=5) to capture this lower seasonal regime, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Kai jumper' (knitwear) is in a stable late-spring/early-summer demand regime. Demand since Period 10 has stabilized around an average of 37 units/week (Periods 10-16: 26, 25, 44, 43, 38, 39, 42). This is significantly lower than the winter samples and early spring, reflecting seasonal decline for sweaters. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on early history. Inventory on-hand is 70, with 76 in transit (ordered P15 and P16). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the current regime average (~37), protected demand is roughly 185 units. With 146 units currently in the system (70+76), the OR backend should order to maintain this level, accounting for the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), which target a 50% service level. I will use recent_N=7 for demand mean/variance calculation to capture the stable cluster since Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 10 (late April to May) at an average of ~37 units/week, down from previous periods, aligning with summer seasonality for knitwear.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which is entering its seasonal low in Summer. Since Period 10 (mid-April), demand has stabilized significantly. The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 34.4 units per week, with a notable dip to 18 units in the most recent period (P17). On-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory is 114 units (from orders in P15, P16, and P17). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning the order from P15 (25 units) is expected to arrive in Period 19. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 166 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current average demand. Given the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend will aim for a roughly 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the stable summer regime since late April, filtering out the higher spring demand samples. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 'Kai jumper', which is knitwear. As established in the carry-over insights, demand for knitwear has significantly decreased as we moved from spring into summer. Demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) has averaged approximately 31.8 units per week (38, 39, 42, 18, 22), confirming a sustained lower-demand regime compared to the early year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (visible up to P7). We currently have 30 units on-hand and 120 units in-transit (ordered in P15, P16, P17, and P18). The first of these orders (25 units from P15) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of the current period (P19), which will be reflected in the next period's start. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1/$1), the backend's target service level is 50%. My objective is to prevent overstocking during this low-demand summer season while maintaining a lean buffer. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent summer demand levels (mean ~31.8, L=4).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Kai jumper' (knitwear), which is in low seasonal demand during June. Demand has significantly decreased since spring, stabilizing at a much lower regime. The most recent demand samples (Periods 17-19) show values of 18, 22, and 13, averaging approximately 18 units/week. Since Period 10, the broader average has been around 30 units/week, but the last few weeks suggest a further dip as summer peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 order arriving in P19). I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower summer demand regime (roughly covering late April to June) while filtering out the much higher early-year data. This balances the need for a safety stock buffer against the high holding costs (which equal the profit per unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in June (Periods 17-19), averaging ~18 units/week compared to the previous ~37 units/week seen in May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which is entering its seasonal trough during the summer months. Recent demand for Periods 17-20 has been low, averaging approximately 16.25 units per week (18, 22, 13, 12). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals in Periods 19 and 20. Total on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 62, totaling 143 units. With an estimated demand of ~16 units/week, the pipeline covers approximately 9 weeks, which is well above the (L+1) = 5 week target. Therefore, I will use recent demand history to set a lower mu_hat to prevent further inventory creep during this low-season period. I choose N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent June demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June (P17-P20) confirmed at a low average of ~16 units/week, reflecting deep summer seasonality for knitwear.

In Period 21, demand was only 4 units. The average demand for the most recent 4-week regime (Periods 18-21) is approximately 12.75 units per week (22, 13, 12, 4), which is significantly lower than the May average of ~37. Looking at the inventory, on-hand is currently 115 units, plus 24 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20), totaling a pipeline of 139 units. With the promised and consistently observed lead time of 4 periods, a base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~13 units/week, we have over 10 periods of supply. The OR backend needs to recognize this sharp regime shift to prevent further overstocking while holding costs and profits are equal ($1/unit). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this deep-summer demand level and calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this July/late-June performance.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is in deep summer seasonality, resulting in significantly lower demand compared to the early year samples. Recent demand for June and July (Periods 17-22: 18, 22, 13, 12, 4, 24) averages approximately 15.5 units per week. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P19/P15, P20/P16, P21/P17, P22/P18). With On-hand inventory at 97 and In-transit at 18 (total 115), and current weekly demand around 15-16 units, the current pipeline covers over 7 weeks of demand, which exceeds the review + lead time requirement of 5 weeks (L=4). Therefore, the OR backend logic will naturally minimize ordering given the high stock level relative to the summer demand regime. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the most recent summer demand levels and keep L at default.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (2019/07/22). The item is a knitwear jumper, which is experiencing clear off-season demand. The demand regime has remained low and stable over the summer months. Specifically, demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) has averaged approximately 15.7 units per period (18, 22, 13, 12, 4, 24, 17). The current on-hand inventory is 89 units with 9 units in-transit (due to arrive next period). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a total lead-time-plus-review cycle of 5 periods (L+1), the current stock (98 total units) covers approximately 6.2 periods of demand (98 / 15.7), which is sufficient. The holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), resulting in a low critical ratio (0.5), emphasizing the importance of minimizing excess inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the summer low, and maintain lead time at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) for knitwear confirmed stable at ~16 units/week (P17-P23 average).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is currently in its off-peak summer season. Since Period 17 (June and July), the demand has been low and stable, with an average demand of approximately 14.4 units/week (Periods 17-24). Specifically, the last four periods (Periods 21-24) showed demand values of 4, 24, 17, and 11, averaging 14 units/week. My current on-hand inventory is 87 units with 0 in-transit. Calculated as (L+1) * mean demand, the required base stock for a 4-period lead time is (4+1) * 14 = 70 units. Since 87 > 70, the system is currently overstocked for the summer regime. No new orders are needed at this stage, and the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in zero orders. I will use N=8 for mu_hat (covering the summer period from P17-P24) and N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5, 2019). The product is a knitwear jumper, which undergoes significant seasonality. Historical data and carry-over insights show a decline from early year peaks to a low summer regime (June-July) of ~16 units/week. Recent demand (P21-P25) has been 4, 24, 17, 11, 12, averaging ~13.6 units/week. Since we are now in early August, we should anticipate the beginning of the transition into late summer and autumn, where knitwear demand typically starts to recover. However, current on-hand inventory is 75 units with zero in-transit. With an average demand of ~15 units/week and a lead time of 4 periods, our current inventory covers approximately 5 weeks of demand, which aligns closely with the coverage needed for a (L+1) horizon. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To prevent stockouts during the upcoming seasonal transition while managing holding costs, I will use a recent N=10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized summer demand (~18 units/week) and use default for L as it has been consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand remains in the low summer regime (avg ~14 units/week over P21-P25), but transition to autumn knitwear demand is expected in the coming weeks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are exiting the deep summer trough (July average ~14-16) and moving into August. Period 26 showed a significant demand jump to 41 units, likely signaling the start of the 'Autumn/Pre-Fall' transition for knitwear. With a lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now will arrive in mid-September (Period 31), which is prime sweater weather. We must increase the forecast (mu_hat) to capture this rising trend and avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the recent uptick and previous weeks, effectively signaling a regime shift toward the higher autumn demand levels seen earlier in the year (approx 40-50 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 26: demand spiked to 41 units (up from ~14 average), consistent with the start of autumn knitwear seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (knitwear/jumper) is transitioning into the autumn season. Demand has surged from a summer average of ~14 units to 41 units in Period 26 and 53 units in Period 27 (Date: Aug 12), causing a stockout. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 63 units in-transit (orders from P26 and P27). To respond to this seasonal shift, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 250 (calculated as (1+L) * 50 units/period, where L=4), aligning it with the recent demand spike and historical early-spring/autumn levels. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility seen during demand transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 26-27 average demand is ~47 units/week, up significantly from the ~14 units/week summer average, signaling the start of the high-season for knitwear.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). The SKU is a 'Kai jumper' (knitwear), which is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged significantly starting Period 26. Historical samples from early February (Periods 1-3) showed demand between 60-117. Recent demand (P26-P28) is 41, 53, and 54, averaging ~49 units/period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing stockouts (demand of 53 and 54 in the last two periods with 0 sales in P28). In-transit inventory is 132 units (orders from P26, P27, P28). With a lead time of 4 periods, the P26 order is expected in P30. To capture the full autumn surge and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new autumn regime (~49 units/week). L remains at the confirmed 4 periods. sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift validated: Period 26-28 average demand is ~49 units/week, maintaining the upward trend from the summer low of ~14. Inventory is currently stockout; first replenishment from this regime expected Period 30.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 30 (September 2nd). The product is a knitwear jumper, which is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has shifted from a summer low of ~14 units/week to a sustained autumn regime averaging ~49 units/week over the last four periods (P26-P29: 41, 53, 54, 48). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the recent demand surge, but we have 194 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P26 (13 units) are expected to arrive in Period 30's arrival resolution phase, followed by orders from P27 (50 units) in P31. To capture the full autumn demand and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current 4-period mean (~49 units) projected over (L+1) = 5 periods, totaling 245 units. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the new higher demand level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the volatility of the new autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-season confirmed: Period 26-29 demand average is 49 units/week, a ~250% increase from the summer regime. Inventory stockout resolved starting Period 30 arrival resolution.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) marks a significant demand spike in the autumn high-season for knitwear. Period 30 saw demand surge to 126 units, which is a massive jump from the previous 3-week average of ~51 units. This aligns with typical September retail behavior when consumers transition to cooler-weather clothing (the 'Kai jumper'). Looking at the 'In-transit' of 232 units, these were ordered during the lead-up (Periods 27-30) as demand began rising, but haven't arrived yet. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the most recent demand (126) is more than double the previous weeks, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this higher regime. I'll use a forecast of approximately 110 units/week for the L+1 period (5 weeks), totaling 550. This prevents the OR backend from under-ordering based on older, lower demand data while the model waits for arrivals to resolve the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: demand spiked to 126 units (over 2x the previous 3-week average), marking the peak autumn shopping period for knitwear.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kai jumper' (knitwear) has entered its peak autumn regime. Period 31 demand was 129 units, virtually identical to Period 30's 126 units, confirming a significantly higher regime than the initial autumn transition (which was ~50 units). We are currently experiencing stockouts as older, smaller orders arrive (13 units in P30, 50 units in P31). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (current + lead time). Using the last two periods as the most relevant regime (N=2), the mean demand is ~127.5 units/week. Setting mu_hat to cover 5 periods (5 * 127.5 = 637.5). Given the recent volatility and rapid growth, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to ensure high service levels during this stockout-threatened peak. Although N=2 is small, it reflects the step-change in demand better than a longer average. Pipeline currently has 350 units (sum of orders from P28, P29, P30, P31), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Peak autumn demand regime confirmed starting Period 30: average weekly demand shifted from ~50 units to ~128 units (+150%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late September (Period 33), representing the peak autumn demand season for knitwear. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 30, with demand reaching ~130 units/week. While Period 32 demand was lower (80 units), this appears to be a factor of continued stockouts (on-hand was 0 most of the period) or minor weekly variance rather than a downward trend. The average demand since the peak shift (P30-P32) is ~112 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high pipeline of 446 units (ordered in P29-P32), we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time plus review period (5 periods total) at the peak rate. Using N=3 for the recent peak regime (P30-P32) provides a mean of ~112, which aligns with the observed surge. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a high service level while the pipeline starts arriving.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (knitwear) is currently in its autumn peak season. Demand remains high, with the last four periods showing demand of 126, 129, 80, and 118 units. The average demand across these peak weeks (P30-P33) is 113.25 units/period. The current pipeline (In-transit: 497) consists of large orders placed recently (P30: 51, P31: 168, P32: 165, P33: 113), which are expected to arrive in Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37 respectively, assuming the stable 4-period lead time. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have been stocking out for multiple weeks. To ensure we recover service levels while protecting against the eventual end of the peak, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this mean of ~113. Given the volatility within this high-demand regime, sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 4 samples. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak autumn demand regime (Period 30-33) average confirmed at ~113 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn season (October) for the Kai jumper (knitwear). The demand regime significantly shifted around Period 30, with demand jumping from ~50 units to a peak of ~129 units. The most recent demand (Period 34) was lower at 46 units, but given the seasonality and previous spikes (126, 129, 80, 118), we must prepare for sustained high demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. Using N=5 for the demand forecast captures the recent high-demand regime (P30-P34 average is 99.8 units/week). With only 5 units on-hand and 516 in-transit, the system needs to maintain this high-regime base stock to avoid stockouts as larger orders from P31-P33 (totaling 446 units) begin arriving in Periods 35-37.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for knitwear has recently cooled from its late-September peak (P30-P33 average was ~113 units/week) to a more moderate level over the last two periods (P34-P35 average is 47 units/week). The 'In-transit' quantity (348 units) is quite high, primarily consisting of large orders placed during the peak demand window (P32-P34). With the promised lead time of 4 periods, these units are expected to arrive between P36 and P38. Given the current on-hand inventory (125) and the declining demand trend as the initial autumn surge subsides, further ordering is not required. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher autumn average while smoothing the most recent drop, but the high pipeline relative to this demand will naturally lead the OR backend to set a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak autumn surge: Period 34-35 demand averaged 47 units/week, down significantly from the P30-P33 peak of ~113 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (knitwear) has entered a stable post-peak autumn regime. Demand skyrocketed during September (Periods 30-33, mean ~113), but has since cooled significantly in October (Periods 34-36, demand: 46, 48, 18). Period 36 specifically saw a sharp drop to 18 units, suggesting the intense early-autumn purchasing phase has concluded. Current on-hand inventory is 272 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (P34-P36 average is ~37 units). With an additional 183 units in-transit (ordered during the high-demand periods P33-P34), we are well-covered. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this cooldown while maintaining the promised lead time (L=4). Setting N=3 captures the post-peak trend (avg ~37) without being overly reactive to the single low data point of 18, preventing unnecessary over-ordering while carrying high stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak autumn demand regime established starting Period 34: demand has dropped from ~113 units/week to an average of ~37 units/week (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a post-peak autumn demand regime for knitwear. Since Period 34 (Sep 30), weekly demand has significantly corrected from the early September peak of ~113 units down to an average of ~34.5 units (46, 48, 18, 26). Specifically, the last two periods (18 and 26 units) suggest demand is stabilizing at a lower level as we approach the end of the year, likely reverting toward the late-spring/early-summer baseline or a secondary winter level. With 359 units on-hand and 70 units in-transit (total 429), the current inventory is extremely high relative to the forecast of ~35-40 units/week. Since profit equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. My parameters aim to prevent further overstocking by accurately reflecting the lower demand mean. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime established since Period 34.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P37): demand has corrected from ~110 units/week to an average of ~35 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-04. Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this cotton-blend jumper. We observed a summer low (~14-16 units/week), an autumn spike (up to ~128 units/week in late September), and a subsequent correction to a post-peak autumn regime. For the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 36 units/week (46, 48, 18, 26, 42), which is consistent with the 'Post-peak autumn demand regime' identified in previous periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 387 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. At the current average of ~36 units/week, our 387 units cover approximately 10 weeks of demand, which is more than double the required pipeline (5 weeks * 36 = 180 units). The large on-hand inventory resulted from shipments ordered during the peak demand phase arriving after the demand had already cooled. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current stabilizer regime and avoid further overstocking while holding costs are high ($1.0/unit). No new order should be triggered by the OR backend given the high inventory position.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The 'Kai jumper' (knitwear) has moved past its peak autumn demand period (P30-P33, avg ~113) into a stable post-peak regime. Analyzing demand from Period 34 to Period 39 (last 6 weeks), we see values of 46, 48, 18, 26, 42, and 17. The average for this post-peak regime is approximately 33 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 370 units following the large orders placed during the peak surge. With a lead time of 4 periods, our coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1). At the current average demand of ~33 units/week, 5 periods of demand equals ~165 units. Since on-hand inventory (370) significantly exceeds this requirement and there are no units in-transit, the OR backend will correctly naturally skip ordering. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current post-peak regime (P34-P39) and lead time 'L' to 'calculate' as it remains steady at 4.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear peak in September (autumn surge, up to ~130 units/week) followed by a significant decline as winter approaches. Over the last four periods (P37-P40), demand has dropped even further, averaging ~25 units/week. Specifically, the last two weeks (P39-P40) averaged only 15.5 units/week. This suggests the post-peak autumn regime has transitioned into a lower early-winter baseline for this knitwear product. On-hand inventory is very high (356 units), which at current demand levels covers over 14 weeks of supply, far exceeding the 5-week (L+1) coverage target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and current inventory surplus, I will use a shorter demand lookback (N=3) to capture the recent slowdown and avoid further overstocking during this late-season decline.

Carry-over insight: Early winter demand decline confirmed: Average demand for P38-P40 dropped to ~24 units/week, down from the P34-P37 post-peak average of ~35 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the early winter season for the SKU 'Kai jumper' (knitwear). Historically, demand for this item peaked in September (Period 30-33) and has consistently declined through October and November. The most recent demand regime (P38-P41) shows a low average of ~21 units/week (42, 17, 14, 12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 344 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (ending at Period 47). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), and we are carrying enough stock to cover roughly 16 weeks of current demand, to maximize total reward we must minimize further holding costs and avoid additional orders. I will set the base stock parameters to reflect this late-season low demand regime. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent decline (P38-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With 344 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend (using the capped policy) will not place any new orders as our current inventory far exceeds the required base stock (approx. (1+4)*21 = 105 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late-season demand for knitwear is confirmed in a low regime (avg ~21 units/week over P38-41). Current inventory (344 units) is expected to be sufficient for all remaining periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), and the game ends at Period 47. We are in the final 5 periods of the simulation. The product is a knitwear jumper, which has seen a significant seasonal decline as we move into December. Demand over the last five periods (P38-P42) has been 42, 17, 14, 12, and 3, showing a clear downward trend towards the end of the season, with an average of ~17.6 units/week. My current on-hand inventory is 341 units, with no units in transit. Given the maximum possible demand forecast even at the previous higher regime (~35 units/week), this inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 5 periods (341 / 5 = 68.2 units/period). Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0). Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed. I'll use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent late-season low-demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of a 47-period simulation (Date: 2019/12/09). The product is a knitwear jumper, which is currently in a deep late-season/winter demand decline. Recent demand (P41-P43) has dropped to very low levels (12, 3, and 5 units respectively), averaging ~6.6 units per week. This aligns with the seasonal trend observed in previous periods where demand softens significantly after the autumn peak. With an on-hand inventory of 336 units and only 3 periods remaining (P44, P45, P46), our current stock is more than enough to cover any realistic demand scenario without further ordering. At this stage, the primary objective is to minimize holding costs while ensuring no stockouts occur in the final weeks. Given the current inventory levels and the low demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect this low-demand state, while relying on existing on-hand stock to carry us through the end of the game.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (December 16, 2019) out of a total 47 periods. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is now in a late-season/winter liquidation phase. Demand has dropped significantly: the average demand over the last 7 periods (P38-P44) is approximately 13.8 units/week, with the most recent three periods (P42-P44) averaging only 4 units/week. On-hand inventory is 332 units, which is extremely high relative to the remaining demand for just 3 more periods (P45, P46, P47). Even if demand were to spike back to the post-peak autumn average (~35), we have enough stock to cover nearly 10 weeks of sales. Given that the game ends in Period 47, any further ordering would only accumulate holding costs without potential for additional profit. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=7, covering the stabilization in November/December) to reflect the low demand and ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in zero new orders.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), with only one period remaining in the simulation (Period 47). Current on-hand inventory is 330 units. Looking at the demand history since late November (Period 42), weekly demand has dropped to negligible levels (3, 5, 4, and 2 units respectively), which is consistent with the end-of-season clearance for a rib-knit jumper. Given the remaining horizon and the extremely low demand trend, the existing inventory of 330 units is vastly more than enough to cover any possible demand in the final period. No further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand state to ensure no additional stock is ordered by the backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), which is the final period of the game context provided. The product, a knitwear jumper, is in its deep off-season/end-of-cycle phase. Demand has plummeted from its autumn peak (~113-128 units/week) to a negligible amount (~1-5 units/week) over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). With an on-hand inventory of 329 units and virtually no demand, the primary goal is to minimize holding costs. Any further ordering would be counterproductive as current stock covers years of demand at the present rate. parameters are set to stay in line with this low-demand regime, ensuring no new orders are triggered.
