Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra). Historical demand dates are Jan 7 to Feb 4, showing a slight upward trend (51, 39, 58, 70, 62). The average demand is 56 units per week. The date 2019-02-11 is the week leading up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which is a major sales driver for lingerie/bras. I expect a significant demand spike this week and potentially next week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to place an order immediately. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to account for the Valentine's Day seasonality, forecasting a mean demand of 80 units per week across the L+1 (5 period) window. Sigma_hat is set using 'default' to capture historical volatility, and L is set to 'default' (4) as we have no historical lead time data yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a push-up bra, which typically has relatively stable demand but can be influenced by post-Valentine's Day cycles. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 100 units were ordered and 0 arrived (consistent with lead time > 0). Demand in Period 1 was 74 units, which resulted in 74 lost sales because starting on-hand inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 51, 39, 58, 70, 62 (Mean = 56). The recent Period 1 demand of 74 is slightly higher than the historical mean. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (5 historical + 1 game period) to capture the recent slightly higher demand trend, while keeping L at default until we observe actual arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 74 and 66, which is higher than the initial historical average (~56). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 181 units in-transit. The orders from Period 1 and 2 are expected to arrive in Period 5 and 6 respectively, given the promised lead time of 4. Since we have no 'conclude' arrival messages yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. The product is a push-up bra, which generally has stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal shopping. I will use the last 5 samples (3 historical + 2 observed) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent uptick in demand (averaging ~66 recently vs 51-58 earlier). L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' is a Push-up bra, currently in early February to March. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show values between 39-70. Game history for Periods 1-3 shows demand of 74, 66, and 40. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed Period 3, the first order (placed in Period 1) is not expected until Period 5 (arrives during P5, visible at start of P6). Therefore, no lead time drift can be confirmed yet. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and set mu_hat based on the average demand from all available samples (5 historical + 3 game history = 8 samples; Mean \u2248 57.5). mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 57.5 = 287.5. sigma_hat will use the default calculation logic to manage volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 56 units/week. Since the game started (Feb 11), demand has been 74, 66, 40, and 43, averaging 55.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 313 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in periods 1-4 is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or lost shipment. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend (including the last pre-game sample and the 4 game periods) to stabilize the forecast against the slight dip seen in the last two weeks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 65. Demand over the last 5 periods has been [74, 66, 40, 43, 35], showing a decreasing trend from an initial spike. The mean demand is 51.6 and std is 17.1. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With 213 units in-transit and 65 on-hand, our pipeline inventory is 278, which is slightly higher than 5 periods of average demand (258). Given the slight downward trend in demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean more accurately. The OR backend will calculate the base stock and cap based on these parameters to maintain an optimal balance between profit and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a push-up bra. Historical demand shows a downward trend: Period 1 was 74, and the last two periods (P5 and P6) were 35 and 27. The average of all samples (including the seed data) is around 48.3, but the most recent 6 periods (P1-P6) average 47.5, with the last three periods showing a significant drop (40, 43, 35, 27). Actual lead time for the first two deliveries (from P1 and P2) was exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently high (119 on-hand) because of the recent arrivals from P1 and P2. To avoid high holding costs while demand is cooling, I'll set mu_hat to reflect the more recent average demand over the last 5 samples (P2-P6), which averages ~42 per period. This gives a total mu_hat of 210 for (1+L) periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent deceleration.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Push-up bra', a staple lingerie item. Current date is April 1st. Initial demand samples from January (avg ~56) were higher than the recent 5 weeks in the game history (P1-P7 demand: 74, 66, 40, 43, 35, 27, 37; avg ~46). There is a visible downward trend in demand from P1 to P6, followed by a minor uptick in P7. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, and P3. Currently, there is sufficient on-hand inventory (159 units) to cover nearly 4 periods of demand at the recent average. Orders from P4 (55 units) and P6 (13 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P8 and P10 respectively. Given the downward trend which may be stabilizing, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime (~38 units/period) compared to the early peaks. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand decreased from ~56 (pre-game) to ~38 (P3-P7). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The carry-over insight correctly identified a demand drop from the pre-game mean of 56 to approximately 38 during Periods 3-7. However, Period 8 saw demand jump to 55. This could be a random fluctuation or the start of a return to higher demand levels. Total demand samples now include: 74, 66, 40, 43, 35, 27, 37, 55 (Mean \u2248 47.1). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). Current on-hand inventory is 159, with only 13 in transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My estimated safety stock level (z* is roughly 0.84 for a 80% service level based on profit/holding) requires balancing the recent volatility. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the lower demand regime and the recent uptick, resulting in a more responsive mu_hat than the full history mean.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The product is a push-up bra, showing a stable demand regime since Period 3. Average demand from Period 3 to Period 9 is approximately 39.5 units per week, which is significantly lower than the initial samples (~56). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals of orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4. Currently, we have 119 units on-hand and 57 units in-transit (from P6 and P9). Given the (L+1) logic, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 5 * 39.5 = 197.5 units. Current inventory + pipeline = 119 + 57 = 176 units. We are slightly below the target, and the backend capped policy will manage the replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (P3-P9) and default for others.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 arrived exactly in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10 respectively). Order from P5 was 0, so no arrival was expected in P9. The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over insights is stable: demand since P3 has averaged approximately 39.6 units per period (40, 43, 35, 27, 37, 55, 40, 40). Recent demand in the last three periods (P8-P10) has been 55, 40, and 40, averaging 45 units, though the P8 spike might be an outlier. I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift demand average accurately (Period 3 to 10 inclusive). For sigma_hat, N=8 will also be used to reflect the variance of this lower-demand regime. The stock level is currently healthy with 92 on-hand and 82 in-transit, so maintaining the current forecast methodology should optimize the balance between service level and holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand analysis shows a stable regime since Period 3. From P3 to P11, the average weekly demand is approximately 40.4 units (samples: 40, 43, 35, 27, 37, 55, 40, 40, 41). The pre-game data (mean ~56) is no longer representative of the current observed demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Current inventory position: On-hand (51) + In-transit (121) = 172. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~200. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand stability and ignore the initial high-demand noise. L will be kept at 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 40 units/week since Period 3. Initial five pre-game samples (Avg 56) over-represented demand compared to realized performance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' is currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 12, where demand (55) exceeded available stock (51). Total demand has stabilized around a mean of 40-42 units per week since Period 3. The current date is May 6, 2019. Lingerie typically experiences stable demand outside of Valentine's Day (which occurred in Period 1/2). Currently, there are 162 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 9 (44 units) to arrive in Period 13 resolution, followed by Period 10's order (38 units) in Period 14. To ensure the OR backend captures the post-Period 3 demand regime (roughly 41.3 units/week) without being skewed by the high pre-game/P1-P2 samples (Mean ~60), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10, covering Period 3 through Period 12. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. However, a significant amount of inventory (174 units) is in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 10 (38 units) to arrive during Period 14, followed by the Period 11 order (39 units) in Period 15, and the Period 12 order (41 units) in Period 16. Demand has averaged approximately 39.8 units over the last 11 periods (P3-P13), showing higher stability than the pre-game samples. Recent demand (P12-P13) has ticked up to 50-55 units, possibly due to seasonal factors or mid-May shopping trends. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average while acknowledging the recent slight increase in volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 14) spiked significantly to 113 units, more than double the stabilized average of ~40 observed between Periods 3-13. This may indicate a seasonal shift or promotion (Mother's Day in some regions or mid-May shopping). Additionally, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 12, 13, and 14 because on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the demand. Our current on-hand inventory is 0. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure our parameters account for both the increased demand level and the high risk of stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of increasing demand (avg ~62) while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma). This allows the OR backend to increase the order quantity to refill the pipeline and build a buffer for the current higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 14: 113 units (up from ~40 avg). Consecutive stockouts occurring Periods 12-14 due to demand surge and pipeline lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely seasonal or event-driven, with demand jumping from an average of ~40 to 113 (P14) and 80 (P15). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a stockout state. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 15 confirms this regime shift. To recover and meet the higher demand level, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will capture the surge (P13: 50, P14: 113, P15: 80, Avg: 81), which is approximately double the previous baseline. Setting mu_hat using N=3 estimates the (1+L) requirement at ~405 units (81 * 5). With 260 units already in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap to bridge this new service level requirement while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen in the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average demand increased from ~40 to ~81 units (+100%) since Period 13.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 13/14, likely due to late spring/early summer seasonality for lingerie. Demand in the last four periods (P13-P16) has averaged ~76.5 units (50, 113, 80, 63), significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~40. We are currently experiencing consecutive stockouts despite arrivals (P12-P16) because units ordered during the low-demand regime (P9-P12) are arriving now and are insufficient for the current surge. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since we have had 4 periods of this high-demand data, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this shift and ensure the OR backend generates a high base stock to flush the pipeline. The L parameter remains at default (4) as arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volatility demand regime. After a significant spike in Periods 14-16 (demand: 113, 80, 63), demand dropped to 42 in Period 17, closer to the historical mean of 40-50. However, the system experienced severe stockouts recently, and demand uncertainty remains high. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. While the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat would capture the average of the spike, it might over-order if the spike was a temporary event. However, looking at the product description (Push-up bra) and the dates (late May/early June), we might be seeing a seasonal lift. To be safe given the $4/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost (4:1 ratio), I will use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the surge and the recent 'cool down' equally. This approximates mu_hat for the next 5 periods based on the most recent regime shift noted in Carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-spike; Period 17 demand (42) suggests a potential return to previous levels, but recent mean (P13-P17) is ~70 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand for Women's Lingerie (SKU 253448001) shows signs of stabilizing after a significant surge peaking in Period 14 (113 units). Demand in the last two periods (P17: 42, P18: 42) has returned to levels seen prior to the surge (~40 units). However, the period P13-P16 averaged roughly 76 units. Combining the recent stability with the previous volatility, I am calculating a base demand forecast by looking at the last 6 periods (P13-P18), which averages 65 units/period. This provides a buffer against another potential spike while acknowledging the recent lower demand. On-hand inventory is 25, with a very healthy pipeline of 335 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L=4, mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to bridge the high-demand surge and recent cooling, and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain service levels while accounting for the massive in-transit volume which may trigger the OR engine's cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand returned to ~42 units/period (P17-P18) following the P14-P16 surge (avg 76 units). Current demand regime (P13-P18) mean is ~65 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis for SKU 253448001 (Womens Lingerie). The demand surge observed between Periods 14-16 (avg ~85) has subsided, with the last three periods (P17-P19) showing stabilization around 43 units/period (42, 42, 46). The on-hand inventory has recovered to 89 units following the arrival of the P15 order (110 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P15 order in P19. The pipeline (In-transit: 242) contains large orders placed during the high-demand spike (P16: 133 units, P17: 82 units) which will arrive starting next period (P20-P21). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand reverts to the baseline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the stabilized demand level (~43 units/period) rather than the trailing 6-week mean which remains inflated by the spike. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand for P17-P19 is 43 units, down from the P14-P16 surge average of 85 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 has definitively stabilized following the surge observed between Periods 14-16 (avg ~85 units). Since Period 17, demand has settled into a new regime with an average of approximately 45.5 units (42, 42, 46, 52). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (170 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the surge response (Period 15 '110 units' and Period 16 '133 units'). With 109 units still in-transit and a stable demand forecast, we have sufficient safety stock. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current post-surge stabilization. L is set to calculate as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 (Women's Push-up Bra) has stabilized after a significant surge between Periods 14-16 (peak of 113). Recent demand observations (P17-P21: 42, 42, 46, 52, 65) show a gradual upward trend but remain significantly lower than the surge peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 51.4 units. Looking at the inventory, we have 187 units on-hand and 27 units in-transit (ordered P18/P19), while the pipeline is currently very full due to large orders placed during the surge arriving now. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory (187) already covering more than 3 periods of recent average demand and more arriving, the primary risk is high holding costs ($1/unit/period) rather than stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this post-surge stabilization and the slight upward trend, while keeping L at calculate to utilize the consistent 4-period lead time history.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of stabilization after a mid-year surge. For the most recent six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged approximately 50.3 units (42, 42, 46, 52, 65, 55). While this is higher than the early-year average (~40), it is significantly lower than the surge peak of 113. Given the current date (July 15), there are no immediate major retail holidays expected to spike demand for this category (Push-up bra) in the next 5 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (142), and in-transit inventory (69) includes orders from P19 (17 units) and P22 (52 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current post-surge baseline of ~50 units/period, which helps prevent over-ordering while maintaining adequate stock (Safety Stock of 1.28 * sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a new higher baseline: P17-P22 average is ~50 units/period, compared to the pre-surge baseline of ~40 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 has reached a stable new regime following the Period 14-16 spike. Demand for the last seven periods (P17-P23) has averaged 50 units (42, 42, 46, 52, 65, 55, 48), establishing a higher baseline compared to the pre-spike average of ~40 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 111 units, with 110 units in the pipeline (scheduled arrivals for the orders placed in P22 and P23). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the stabilization at ~50 units/week, I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current baseline while maintaining responsiveness to the recent volatility observed. This ensures the base stock (L+1 periods) target aligns with the current average of ~250 units total for the replenishment cycle.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is currently in a stable demand regime following a mid-year spike (Periods 14-16). Since Period 17, demand has stabilized at a slightly higher baseline than the pre-spike period. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P17-P24) show an average demand of approximately 47 units/period (42, 42, 46, 52, 65, 55, 48, 29). The most recent observation (Period 24) was 29, which is the lowest in this regime, suggesting a possible cooling. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 82 and in-transit at 155, the total pipeline is 237 units. To ensure coverage over the (L+1) period horizon while accounting for recent stabilization, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-surge mean (approx 47 units/period) and volatility. This balances the risk of stockouts seen earlier with the current holding cost of inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/08/05), the current on-hand inventory is 39 units. The demand has stabilized at a new baseline following a major surge in May (P14-P16). Calculating the mean demand since the surge ended (P17-P25), the average is approximately 47 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical concludes. I am observing two periods with 0 arrivals (P24, P25), but this is expected because the corresponding orders from P20 and P21 were 0 units. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 175 units, which covers future periods. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 9-period regime (P17-P25) to capture this updated baseline of ~47 units/period, and using the same window for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the surge period.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand baseline (P17-P25) confirmed at ~47 units/period, slightly higher than the pre-surge baseline of ~40 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 26 (111 units). This spike mirrors the surge observed in Period 14, suggesting a recurring or seasonal volatility despite the general 'stable' baseline. The average demand for the 'stable' period (P17-P25) was 47.7 units, but the sudden jump to 111 units in P26 necessitates a more responsive mu_hat calculation to avoid prolonged stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture both the stable period and the most recent spike, which brings the 10-period average to approximately 54 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P22 order arriving in P26. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher recent volatility (sigma_hat) and the increased mean demand to rebuild inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spike detected in Period 26 (111 units), resembling the Period 14 surge (113 units). Post-surge baseline (P17-P26) now averages ~54 units due to high-demand episodes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing its second major demand surge, similar to the one observed in Periods 14-16. Demand for the last two periods was 111 and 113 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~47. This spike has once again exhausted on-hand inventory, leading to consecutive stockouts in Period 26 and 27. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this spike (Mean of P25-P27 is ~89 units/period). With a lead time of 4 and roughly 5 periods of demand to cover (L+1), the target stock is around 445 units. On-hand is 0 and in-transit is 196, so a large order is required to prevent prolonged stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the high volatility introduced by these recurring spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second major demand surge confirmed in Period 26-27 (Avg 112 units), matching the pattern from Period 14. This suggests a bi-monthly or cyclical spike for this SKU. Recent demand baseline (P25-P27) has shifted from ~47 to ~89.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a second major demand surge (Periods 26-28 average = 111.3 units), strikingly similar to the surge observed in Period 14 (113 units). This suggests a cyclical pattern or specific event-driven demand roughly every 12-14 weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and combined with high demand, significant stockouts have occurred in Periods 26-28. Although Period 29 demand hasn't concluded, the trend from the first surge (P14-P16) suggests demand may stay elevated for 3-4 periods before returning to a baseline. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand state (Avg ~111 over 3 periods). Using N=3 for sigma_hat also accounts for the high volatility during these spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second major demand surge confirmed (P26-P28 avg: 111 units), mirroring the Period 14 surge (113 units). Pattern suggests a ~12-week cyclicality for high-demand episodes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the middle of a significant demand surge, mirroring the pattern observed in Period 14. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 111 units, while Period 29 demand was 68 units, suggesting the peak may be tapering but remains well above the baseline of ~40-50. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) with consecutive stockouts since Period 26. To recover and cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent high-demand regime. Using the average of the last 4 periods (P26-P29: 111, 113, 110, 68) which is ~100 units/period, I set mu_hat = 500 (5 periods * 100). sigma_hat is also set higher using explicit values to account for the high volatility during these cyclical surges. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand surge confirmed: High-demand episodes (~110 units) occur approximately every 12 periods (P14-P16 and P26-P28), followed by a return to a baseline of ~45-50 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a strong cyclical demand pattern with surges occurring approximately every 12 periods (P14-P16 and P26-P28), where demand spikes to ~110 units. Historical data shows that following these surges, demand stabilizes back to a baseline of approximately 45-50 units (as seen in P17-P22). Period 31 is now in the post-surge phase (similar to P17). For the next 4 periods (the lead time), I expect demand to remain at this baseline. Using recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the local higher baseline and the recent volatility without being overly influenced by the peak surge that has just concluded. Pipeline inventory is currently high (497 units) due to aggressive ordering during the P27-P30 surge period, ensuring that future demand will be met as these orders arrive. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its post-surge baseline phase following the cyclical peak observed in Periods 26-28. Historical patterns (from Period 17 onwards) show that after a surge, demand stabilizes at a higher baseline than the initial periods. Comparing the current post-surge performance (Period 31 demand: 35) with the previous stabilization (Periods 17-25 avg: 47), demand is expected to settle around 45-50 units. While the recent surge (P26-P28) averaged 111 units, recent demand (P29-P31) has trended down (68, 62, 35). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the lingering volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The large in-transit balance (406 units) from previous high-order periods (P28-P30) will begin arriving soon, meaning the OR backend will likely order 0 this period to prevent overstocking as on-hand inventory builds up.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand baseline (P29-P31) currently averaging 55 units, trending towards the pre-surge baseline of ~47-50 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'post-surge' stabilization phase. Historically, we have observed two major demand spikes (~110-115 units) around Period 14 and Period 26, suggesting a roughly 12-week cycle. Between these spikes, demand stabilizes at a baseline. Following the second surge (P26-P28), demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P31: 35, P32: 26). The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) is approximately 41 units, which aligns with the pre-surge baseline identified in the carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is 185 and in-transit is 251 (total pipeline 436). Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (P33), the next potential surge is not expected until around P38-P40. We need to avoid over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the baseline. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend toward baseline while maintaining a safety margin for volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=6). This prevents excessive accumulation while we burn through the high inventory levels resulting from orders placed during the P26-P28 surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand return to baseline confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P32 is 30.5 units, signaling the end of the second major cyclical surge (P26-P28). Sustained baseline established at ~40-45 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'post-surge' phase. Based on historical data (Periods 14-16 and 26-28), high-demand spikes of ~110 units occur approximately every 12 periods. Outside of these surges, demand stabilizes at a baseline of approximately 40-45 units. Recent demand (Periods 31-33) has been 35, 26, and 41, confirming we are back in the baseline regime. On-hand inventory is currently high (258 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the last surge. In-transit inventory remains at 137 units (ordered in Period 30). Given the 4-period lead time and the current baseline demand, the total pipeline (395 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next several periods (approx 5 periods until the next potential surge start around Period 38-40). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this baseline demand using the last 3 samples (P31-P33) to prevent unnecessary ordering while holding high inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms that the SKU has finished its second major cyclical surge (averaging ~111 units from P26-P28) and has returned to its baseline. In the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has been 35, 26, 41, and 38, resulting in a recent mean of 35 units. The Carry-over insights suggest a baseline of 40-45 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (357 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P27-P30). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, my (L+1) window is 5 periods. Expected demand over this window is approximately 175-200 units. Since current on-hand (357) significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current regime and no more stock is in-transit, the OR backend will naturally stop ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the confirmed return to baseline demand around 35-40 units, ensuring the system doesn't over-order while we burn through current excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand return to baseline confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P34 is 35 units, consistent with the expected return to a 40-45 unit baseline after the second 12-week cyclical peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-surge baseline regime following the cyclical demand peak observed between Periods 26-28 (Avg ~111). Consistent with the Carry-Over Insights, demand has returned to a baseline of approximately 30-40 units (P31-P35 avg of 33.8). We currently have an on-hand inventory of 328 units and 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a return to baseline demand, current inventory covers approximately 8-10 periods of demand. This high inventory position results from the OR backend responding to the previous demand surge. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the 40-unit baseline, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent stabilized demand (P31-P35) and set lead time to 'calculate' based on consistent historical arrival performance of 4 periods. No new orders are expected or needed until inventory depletes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'post-surge' baseline phase. History indicates two major demand surges occurring approximately every 12 periods (P14-P16 and P26-P28), with spikes around 110 units. Between these spikes, demand stabilizes at a baseline of roughly 35-45 units. We are currently in Period 37, which is 9 periods after the start of the last surge (P26). Following the established 12-period cycle, the next potential surge is expected around Period 38-40. Current inventory (On-hand: 288) is high due to the large orders placed during the last surge arriving after demand subsided. At a baseline of ~40 units/period and L=4, the required base stock is approximately (5 * 40) = 200 units plus safety stock. Since current on-hand (288) significantly exceeds this and no more units are in transit, no new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (P31-P36) to capture the current stable baseline (~35 units) while the system burns through excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Next cyclical demand surge anticipated Period 38-40 based on 12-week recurring pattern (P14, P26). Current baseline demand (P31-P36) is 34.8 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 38. Historically, the SKU '253448001' exhibits a 12-week cyclical demand surge. Previous peaks occurred at Period 14 (demand 113) and Period 26 (demand 111). We are currently exactly 12 periods after the start of the previous surge (P26). We must anticipate a similar spike (avg ~110 units/period for 3 periods) starting between Period 38 and 40. The current on-hand inventory is 252 units with no units in-transit. A 3-period surge of 110 units equals 330 units, while baseline demand is ~40. To cover the anticipated surge plus the lead time (L=4), we expect total demand over the (L+1) horizon to be significantly higher than the current baseline. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a base stock level that accounts for the upcoming cyclical surge. Setting mu_hat to 400 (representing ~80 units/period over 5 periods) ensures that the OR backend triggers an order if the surge depletes the current on-hand stock rapidly, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen during these cyclical transitions.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand surge anticipated starting Period 38-39 (12-week cycle: P14, P26). Expect demand to spike from ~40 to ~110 units for approximately 3 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 39. Based on the 12-week cyclical pattern observed in Period 14 and Period 26, a significant demand surge (averaging ~110 units for 3 periods) is expected between Period 38 and Period 40. Demand in Period 38 was still low (34), suggesting the surge may start this period (Period 39). The current on-hand inventory is 218 units, and we have 136 units in-transit (ordered in Period 38), totaling 354 units of pipeline inventory. A 3-period surge of 110 units plus 2 periods of baseline demand (45 units) totals 420 units for the (L+1) window. While we are currently slightly under the 420-unit target, the OR backend's capped policy and the substantial on-hand inventory mean that the large order placed in Period 38 (136 units) already covers the bulk of the predicted surge. To maintain the service level across the high-demand window, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the forecasted surge (3 periods at 110, 2 periods at 45 = 420) and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility during these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand surge expected starting Period 39/40 (12-week cycle: P14, P26, P38+). Demand typical peaks at ~110 units for 3 consecutive weeks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40. Analysis of the historical demand (Periods 14-16 and 26-28) reveals a cyclical surge pattern occurring approximately every 12 periods, where demand spikes from a baseline of ~40 units to ~110 units for three consecutive weeks. Based on this 12-week periodicity (P14, P26, P38), we are entering the third expected surge window. While demand in Periods 38 (34 units) and 39 (31 units) remained at baseline, the surge is imminent. To prepare for this, I have placed large orders in P38 and P39 (totaling 274 units in-transit). For Period 40, to ensure the OR backend captures the shift from baseline (~40) to surge (~110), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 110. With L=4, this equals 550. This ensures the base stock level (target inventory) is high enough to cover the anticipated spike without waiting for historical averages to catch up, while the OR's internal cap will prevent excessive over-ordering if the pipeline is already full.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a 12-week cyclical demand surge (approx. 110 units/week for 3 weeks). Based on previous peaks at P14 and P26, the third peak was anticipated around P38-P40. However, demand remained at baseline levels (~30 units) during P38-P40, suggesting the peak is slightly delayed or the cycle has shifted. Despite this, the high in-transit volume (420 units) from orders placed in P38-P40 is sufficient to cover a peak if it occurs now or in the immediate future. On-hand inventory is 158 units. With 420 units in the pipeline and a baseline demand of ~35, we are currently overstocked for the baseline but positioned for the expected surge. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a high target based on the anticipated surge (110 units * 5 periods) to ensure the OR backend does not prematurely cancel or undershoot, though the 'cap' mechanism will likely limit new orders until the pipeline clears. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed during these cycle transitions.

Carry-over insight: Anticipated 12-week cyclical surge (P38-P40) delayed; baseline demand persists at ~30-35 units. Pipeline heavily loaded (420 units) in anticipation of surge.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The anticipated 12-week cyclical demand surge (observed previously at P14 and P26) has not yet materialized as of Period 41, with demand remaining in the 30-45 unit baseline range. However, given the product (Push-up bra) and the current date (November 25), we are entering the major 'Black Friday' and holiday shopping season. Historical peaks of ~110 units are highly likely to occur imminently. The pipeline inventory (464 units) is substantial due to aggressive ordering in Periods 38-41 (136, 138, 146, 44 units) in preparation for this cycle. With 113 units on-hand and the first of these large orders expected to arrive in Period 43, the current priority is to avoid excessive overstock once the surge concludes. I am maintaining mu_hat to reflect the expected high-demand state (approx. 85-90 units/period) to ensure the OR backend doesn't prematurely cancel the necessary buffer, but I am setting L and mu_hat using 'recent_N' and 'explicit' respectively to bridge the gap between the currently low observed demand and the imminent seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday seasonal demand surge expected P42-P44, coinciding with the 12-week cyclical pattern. Pipeline is heavily loaded with ~460 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The SKU exhibits a ~12-week cyclical demand surge, previously observed around P14 and P26. We are currently in the window where the third surge was expected (P38-P42). While demand increased slightly to 58 in P42, the massive ~110 unit spikes seen in previous cycles have not yet fully materialized. However, we are entering the peak December holiday season (post-Black Friday/cyber week), which often sustains higher demand for lingerie. The pipeline is currently heavily loaded with 328 units (orders from P39, P40, P41) following the arrival of the P38 order (136 units). With 191 units on hand and significant stock incoming, we must avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (P47). The mu_hat is set using an explicit value of 275, representing a weighted forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1): anticipating the cyclical surge/holiday peak to be around 80-100 for the next 1-2 weeks before potentially tapering. This protects against stockouts while acknowledging the large pipeline already in place.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/seasonal demand increase confirmed Period 42: demand rose to 58 units. The anticipated 12-week cyclical surge (P38-P42) appears merged with or delayed by the December holiday season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the expected holiday/seasonal demand period (December). While the predicted 12-week cyclical surge (which usually hits ~110 units) appears slightly muted or shifted compared to P14 and P26, the current on-hand inventory (309) and in-transit units (190) from recent large orders (P40, P41) provide a robust cushion. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a significant pipeline (499 total inventory units) and demand has actually dipped to 20 units in P43, I will maintain the current inventory position without placing new large orders. This avoids excessive holding costs while still covering a potential late-December demand spike. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current December behavior and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for higher volatility observed during these seasonal windows.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal demand profile: P42 demand rose to 58, but P43 dropped to 20. The 12-week cyclicality (expected P38-40) has not manifested as a sharp 100+ unit surge, suggesting seasonal year-end patterns are overriding the previous cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-230.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in Period 45, following the typical peak holiday/seasonal period. The anticipated 12-week cyclical surge (predicted for P38-P40) did not manifest as the previously observed ~110 unit spikes, but rather as sustained moderate demand (P41-P44 mean: 42). With on-hand inventory at 410 units and only 44 units in-transit (ordered P41, expected arrival P45), the pipeline is significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels (P33-P44 avg: ~36 units). Given there are only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, the strategy is to set a very low base stock to prevent further ordering, allowing the existing on-hand inventory to satisfy the remaining demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: The 12-week cyclical surge (expected P38-P40) was superseded by a stable seasonal baseline (~35-45 units) through December, failing to reach the ~110 unit peaks seen in P14 and P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-129.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final period (Period 46 to 47). Current on-hand inventory is 389 units, which is significantly high given the recent demand baseline. Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged 46.6 units, showing some seasonal year-end volatility but settling far below the cyclical 110-unit spikes previously observed. The predicted cyclical surge (P38-P40) never materialized as a massive peak, and the pipeline orders from that period (totaling 464 units) have now arrived almost in full. With one period remaining, the focus is solely on minimizing holding costs while covering the final week's demand. 389 units of on-hand inventory is more than enough to cover any plausible demand scenario (even a delayed 110-unit spike) for the final period. No further ordering is required. parameters are set to reflect the stable baseline mean (~42) and standard deviation observed over the last 15 periods to ensure the backend OR logic recognizes the overstock and does not place additional orders.

Carry-over insight: The 12-week cyclical surge (expected P38-P40) failed to materialize; demand remained within the 30-65 range through December. High on-hand inventory (389 units) going into the final period ensures zero stockout risk but high holding cost impact.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period. The current on-hand inventory is 318 units, which is extremely high relative to the most recent demand (71 units) and the average demand baseline (approx. 40-50 units). There are no units in-transit. Since this is the final decision period and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends. Even if the arrival happened within this period, current stock is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. To maximize the total reward (R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), I must minimize the ending inventory to reduce holding costs while ensuring demand is met. Given the current surplus, no additional ordering is required.
