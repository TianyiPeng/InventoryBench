Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 685814003 is a 'Richie Hood', a basic cotton-blend hoodie. Historical demand samples (75, 51, 57, 123, 84) show a mean of 78 and a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The most recent demand (123 and 84) suggests a slight upward trend compared to the earlier weeks, possibly due to seasonal transitions in February. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit units, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand (78) for mu_hat and the volatility for sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 ensures we use all available relevant historical data while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'default' (promised L=4) as we have no historical arrival data to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Richie Hood' (hoodie), which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Historical demand samples (last 5) show: 75, 51, 57, 123, 84 (Mean: 78). In Period 1, we observed a demand of 49. Total demand history including P1 is {75, 51, 57, 123, 84, 49}, giving a global mean of ~73. On-hand is 0 because the first order (125 units) was placed in P1 and the promised lead time is 4 periods; it is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. We currently have 125 units in-transit. For Period 2's parameters, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the recent historical samples. N=6 (all available data) is appropriate given the relatively stable demand pattern.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because previous orders (Period 1 and Period 2) haven't arrived yet, as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Consequently, we've missed sales in Periods 1 and 2 (demand was 49 and 123). Total in-transit is 245 units. The historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show values: 75, 51, 57, 123, 84, and recent demand during the game was 49 and 123. The product is a jersey basic hoodie. There is no clear seasonal shift detected yet, but demand is volatile. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to let the system learn from arrivals once they occur. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent patterns (including the historical samples provided and game demand) while responding to the high variance seen recently (123). This helps the OR backend establish a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Men's Hoodie, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-3) shows a mean of approximately 78 units per period (75, 51, 57, 123, 84, 49, 123, 48). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at P4, no orders placed during the game (P1-P3) are expected to have arrived yet (P1 order due P5). Total in-transit is 391 units from P1-P3. Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales as demand is occurring. The OR backend uses a base stock policy covering (L+1) periods. Calculation: mean (78) * (4+1) = 390. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (entire available history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately. L is set to 'default' as no evidence yet suggests the lead time differs from the promise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a Men's Hoodie. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (125 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message next period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 391 units. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (including pre-game data) is [75, 51, 57, 123, 84] and in-game demand for Periods 1-4 is [49, 123, 48, 59]. The mean demand remains relatively stable around 75 units/period. Since the first order is only arriving this period, the stockout in Periods 1-4 was expected due to lead time. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available demand history (N=9, combining pre-game and in-game samples) to ensure the backend computes a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Richie Hood (Jersey Basic Hoodie), which is a stable staple item but may see demand shifts as winter ends. Historical demand samples (pre-game) were [75, 51, 57, 123, 84], mean=78. In-game demand for Periods 1-5 has been [49, 123, 48, 59, 70], mean=69.8. One order of 125 units placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (actual lead time = 4), which matches the promised lead time. We currently have 55 units on-hand and 266 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). The demand hasn't shown a significant trend yet, but variance is high (123 vs 48). I will use recent_N for both demand mean and sigma to capture the in-game behavior, setting N=5 to cover the available recorded in-game history. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 77 units/period across 11 samples (68.6 for the most recent 6 periods). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which means our base stock should target the median demand. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (Scenario A example logic: P1 ordered, P5 arrived = LT 4). Current inventory is 148 on-hand + 174 in-transit (P3: 146, P6: 28) = 322 total. Observed demand in the last 6 periods is [49, 123, 48, 59, 70, 27], showing volatility but no clear seasonal trend for hoodies in March/April yet. I will set L to promised (4) and use the last 6 periods for mu and sigma to capture recent demand levels, balancing for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The observed lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last 3 periods (P5: 70, P6: 27, P7: 18) compared to the initial samples (avg ~78) and early game periods. This likely reflects a post-winter seasonal drop for a sweatshirt/hoodie product as spring begins. Currently, we have 276 units on hand and 28 in transit, totaling 304 units of pipeline inventory. Given the recent average demand of approximately 38 units/period over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), our current inventory is very high relative to needs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slowing demand and avoid further overstocking, which is costly given the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand decline observed starting 2019/3/18 (P6), likely seasonal for hoodie category; average demand dropped from ~70 to <30.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/04/08). The SKU is a 'RICHIE HOOD', which is a sweatshirt-style hoodie. The carry-over insight correctly identified a significant demand drop starting around Period 6 (March 18), coinciding with the transition into Spring, which is a low-demand season for heavy cotton-blend hoodies. History shows demand in the first 5 periods averaged ~70, but the last 3 periods (P6-P8) have averaged 23.3 units. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods. With 251 units on hand and 28 in transit, the current inventory is extremely high relative to the new demand regime (approx 10-12 weeks of coverage). My goal for the OR backend is to prevent further ordering and reduce holding costs by setting parameters that reflect this lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the forecast purely to the post-drop data (P6-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie (RICHIE HOOD), which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline in demand as the environment moves into mid-April. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (Feb to early March) averaged ~78 units, but has plummeted since Period 6 (March 18th) to an average of ~21 units (27, 18, 25, 15). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 236 units on-hand and an additional 28 in-transit, current inventory levels are extremely high (over 10 periods of supply at the current demand rate). To avoid excessive holding costs in a low-demand regime where profit equals holding cost ($1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new, lower demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' based on the consistent 4-period observations. The OR backend should naturally stop ordering due to the high stock-to-demand ratio.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodie), which is experiencing a sustained seasonal decline as the calendar enters late April (Spring). Period 11 follows a significant demand drop observed since Period 6. Since 2019-03-18 (P6), weekly demand has been: 27, 18, 25, 15, and 19. The current mean for this 5-period regime is approximately 20.8 units per week, compared to the earlier historical average of ~70. We have high on-hand inventory (245 units) and zero in-transit shipments. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, we need enough stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. At a demand of ~21 units/week, we need approximately 105 units. With 245 units on-hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand and should not order more. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the surplus, effectively suppressing new orders while we draw down inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Richie Hood' (hoodie), which typically sees a seasonal decline in late spring. Period 12 (late April) shows a continued low-demand regime since late March (Period 7). Since Period 6, demand has consistently been low (27, 18, 25, 15, 19, 22), averaging approximately 21 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 223 units with 0 in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline (+L+1) at current demand rates would be approximately 105 units (21 * 5). Since on-hand (223) significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current low-demand regime, the goal is to prevent any new orders and allow inventory to bleed down. I will set L to 'calculate' (all observed lead times have been 4). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the period since the demand drop) to capture the current mean of ~21. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state. The OR engine's capped policy will ensure no new orders are placed as long as current stock remains high.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/06 (Period 13). The product is a hoodie, which has entered a low-demand seasonal regime as temperatures rise in the spring. Since Period 6 (2019/03/18), demand has consistently remained low, averaging approximately 23.4 units per period (samples: 27, 18, 25, 15, 19, 22, 38). This is a significant drop from the pre-March average of approximately 78. Current on-hand inventory is 185 units, and there is no inventory in transit. With an expected demand of ~23 units per period and a lead time of 4, the current stock of 185 units is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (115 units expected demand), especially given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0). To avoid further holding costs on an overstocked item during its off-season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the low-demand regime, which will likely result in the OR backend placing no new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie (seasonal sweatshirt), and demand has entered a sustained low-volume regime since late March (Period 6). Historical demand samples since P6 are: [27, 18, 25, 15, 19, 22, 38, 20]. The mean for this 8-period regime is 23.0 units/period, down significantly from the initial pre-spring average. Lead times have consistently arrived at the promised 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P6->P10). Current on-hand inventory is 165 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~115 (5 periods * 23 units/period) and 165 units on hand, the system is currently overstocked due to the holding cost being equal to profit ($1.0). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime, which will correctly prevent further ordering until the excess inventory is depleted.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime following the end of the cooler season. Since Period 6 (March 18), demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 22.8 units per week (periods 6-14). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in history (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 6 shipments). Current on-hand inventory is 143 units with no units in-transit. Given the low demand and high relative holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1), the goal is to reduce inventory. The current stock of 143 units covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (143 / 22.8 \u2248 6.2). Since this exceeds the (L+1) = 5 period requirement, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (since the regime shift in P6) to reflect this lower demand and avoid over-ordering through the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) has experienced a significant and sustained demand drop since Period 6 (March 18), coinciding with the transition into warmer weather. Before Period 6, demand averaged ~78; since then (Periods 6-15), it has averaged ~22. For Period 16 (late May), I expect demand to remain low as hoodies are out-of-season. Current on-hand inventory is 131 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (22 units/period). Given the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), and the in-transit inventory is 0, the primary goal is to avoid ordering while depleting existing stock. I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level remains below current on-hand inventory to prevent unnecessary replenishment orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (men's sweatshirt/hoodie), which is a seasonal item. As noted in Period 8 carry-over insights, demand dropped significantly around mid-March (P6) with the onset of spring. This low demand regime has persisted through May and into early June (P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 109 units, while the average weekly demand over the last 11 periods (P6-P16) is approximately 21.5 units. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and current on-hand stock, there is enough inventory to cover roughly 5 weeks of demand (109 / 21.5 \u2248 5.07). Since L=4, the system only needs to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time. With a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0, the OR target service level is 50%. The current on-hand inventory is slightly above the expected requirements for this low-demand summer season. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (P6-P16) to capture the current low-demand stable regime and 'default' for L as observed lead times have consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, which is experiencing sustained low demand during the summer months (currently June). Since the regime shift identified in Period 8, demand has consistently averaged around 21 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 95 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods and we have 95 on hand plus 1 in transit (total 96), our current position covers the risk exposure period of L+1 (5 periods) almost perfectly (96 units / 21 units/period = 4.57 periods). We are currently slightly overstocked but decreasing on-hand inventory through natural sales. No large orders are needed. I will maintain L at 4 (default) and use recent evidence (N=10) to reflect the summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend targets the lower base stock appropriate for the season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a hoodie, which is highly seasonal. Since Period 6 (late March), demand has significantly declined and remained consistently low, averaging approximately 17 units per week over the last 14 periods (Periods 6-19). The current date is June 24, which is deep into the summer season, explaining the extremely low demand observed in recent periods (only 5 units in Period 19). On-hand inventory is 82 units, and there are 109 units in-transit. Given the low demand, the current on-hand inventory alone covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the recent average, and over 15 weeks at the most recent observed demand level. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods when orders arrived. I will use the recent_N method with N=14 to capture the low-demand regime since the seasonal shift, and default for lead-time as it appears stable. The OR backend will likely minimize ordering given the high inventory and low demand forecast.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are managing a hoodie, which typically sees lower demand in summer. The Carry-over insight correctly identified a demand regime shift around Period 6 (March 18), where weekly demand dropped significantly from a mean of ~78 (P1-P5) to ~21 (P6-P19). However, Period 20 showed a sudden spike to 59 units. While this could be a one-off fluctuation or an early pre-fall signal, we must be cautious not to over-react given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the inventory on hand (23) plus significant in-transit (109). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (observed in P5, P6, P7, P10). As of P21, we are waiting for orders from P17, P18, and P19 to arrive. The total pipeline is 109 units, which is ample for the current low-demand regime. To prevent over-ordering during the summer, I will use a larger N (recent 15) for demand to smooth out the P20 spike while acknowledging the low-demand regime established since March. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Hoodie) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand has surged unexpectedly in the last two periods (P20: 59, P21: 98), which is a significant reversal of the previous low-demand regime (avg ~20). This spike likely represents a mid-summer sale or early pre-fall interest. I have 108 units in transit (expected arrivals in P22, P23, and P24). Specifically, P18's order (9 units) and P19's order (99 units) should arrive by P22 and P23 respectively, assuming the consistent 4-period lead time. To address the stockout and the new high-demand signal, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value based on the average of the last two weeks (approx 78/week) scaled for (L+1)=5 periods, totaling 390. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand velocity. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand recovery observed starting 2019/6/24 (P20); weekly demand increased from <20 to ~78 (+300%), likely due to seasonal transition or promotional activity.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Hoodie) is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge starting from 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for the last three periods has been 59, 98, and 87 (Avg: 81.3), compared to the previous low-demand regime of ~20. This spike has exhausted on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts in Periods 21 and 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Periods 17 and 18. Orders placed in Periods 19 and 22 (99 and 145 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 23 and 26 respectively. To address the current stockout and the high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new average of ~81 units per period and its associated volatility. This focuses the OR backend on the current seasonal peak for hoodies.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Hoodie) has entered a high-demand regime since Period 20 (late June), with demand values of 59, 98, 87, and 65 (mean \u2248 77). This follows a low-demand spring/summer period (mean \u2248 18). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (34), following stockouts in P21 and P22. In-transit inventory is high (260), with 145 units ordered in P22 expected to arrive in P26 and 115 units ordered in P23 expected in P27. For Period 24, I must ensure the base stock covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime (starting P20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents the previous low-demand history from underestimating current needs while maintaining protection against stockouts in this high-growth phase.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hood) has experienced a significant demand recovery since P20 (2019/6/24), consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' observation. The most recent demand samples are P20: 59, P21: 98, P22: 87, P23: 65, and P24: 30. The average demand for this 5-period high-demand regime is approximately 67.8 units per week. The drop in P24 (30 units) might be a temporary fluctuation or the start of a cooling period, but overall demand remains much higher than the previous trough (<20). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P21, P22, and P23). On-hand inventory is very low (4 units) with significant pipeline inventory (353 units) coming from orders in P22 (145), P23 (115), and P24 (93). These orders are expected to arrive in P26, P27, and P28 respectively. To maintain availability without over-ordering given the massive pipeline, I will set mu_hat to cover the current 5-period average (L=4 means 1+4=5 periods of demand) using the recent regime length of 5. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this recent period to capture the increased volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, which is seeing a significant and sustained demand recovery starting around Period 20 (2019/6/24), likely due to back-to-school or early autumn seasonal shifts. Demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) has averaged ~66 units per week (59, 98, 87, 65, 30, 58), a sharp increase from the summer lull. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is reliant on the 353 units currently in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand and 0 stock, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this higher demand regime, ensuring the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time plus current period requirements (L+1 = 5 periods). sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the last 6 periods to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 is currently experiencing a high-demand regime, which started around Period 20 (late June). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) is approximately 76 units per period, a substantial increase from the low-season average of ~19. Period 26 specifically saw a demand of 117. With an on-hand inventory of 28 and 208 units in transit (due to orders in P23 and P24), and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain high coverage. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand phase while the OR backend ensures we don't over-order against the existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, and we are currently in late August. Demand has surged significantly since late June (Period 20), likely due to the 'Back to School' season and the approaching fall. In the most recent period (P27), demand reached 154 units, which is the highest recorded. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 215 units in-transit (93 from P24, 122 from P27). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since P20, the demand regime has shifted to a much higher average. I am calculating mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (P20-P27) where demand averaged ~83.5 units, though the volatility is high (sigma). The OR engine needs to account for this higher sustained demand level to rebuild safety stock and prevent stockouts during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 20 (late June); demand since then has averaged ~84 units/period compared to previous low-season average of ~20. Recent trend shows a sharp spike exceeding 100 units/period (P26-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, entering the peak autumn/winter season. Demand has surged significantly since late June (Period 20), with the last three periods (P26-P28) averaging approximately 124 units (117, 154, 102). We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a substantial pipeline of 271 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the high stock-out risk seen in recent periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the transition starting at P20) to capture the high-regime mean (~88 units per period, scaled by 1+L=5). This ensures the base stock reflects the current heightened demand levels while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed during this peak. This setting will aggressively replenish stock to meet early autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak seasonal demand regime: August demand (P26-P28) averaged 124.3 units/period, up from the July average of ~68 units. Stock-outs occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods due to this acceleration.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September, which aligns with peak seasonal demand for hoodies in the sweatshirt category. Recent demand history shows a strong regime shift: August (P26-P28) averaged 124 units. Although P29 recorded a lower demand of 67, this followed two consecutive stock-out periods (P27, P28), and the ending inventory was 0, meaning demand may still be constrained by availability or reflecting high volatility. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) while waiting for 418 units in transit. Since we haven't received an arrival for the order placed in Period 25 (which would have arrived now if lead time was 4), but P25 was an order of 0 units, our next actual arrival is expected in P31 (order from P27). To ensure we capture high seasonal demand and recover from stock-outs, I am using a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the elevated post-June regime (~85 units/period) while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 balances the recent extreme peaks with the broader high-season trend.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a hoodie, entering the peak autumn season (September). Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 20, with August averaging 124 units. Recent demand (P30: 108 units) confirms this high-demand state despite recent stock-outs (on-hand is 0). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P22, P23, P24 all arrived in 4 periods). We currently have 419 units in-transit (ordered in P27, P28, P29, P30). The first of these (122 units from P27) is expected to arrive during the upcoming Period 31. To capture the current seasonal momentum and prevent further stock-outs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting, focusing on the last 10 periods (covering the transition to and peak of the current regime). This N=10 captures the high-demand volatility (mean ~85, including the P26-P30 peak) while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak seasonal demand regime: August/September demand (P26-P30) demonstrates a sustained high level averaging 110 units/period (excluding stock-out affected sales, looking at raw demand). Supply chain remains stable with lead_time=4.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (August/September). Reviewing demand from Period 26 to 31 (ignoring supply-constrained 'sold' units and looking at 'demand'), we see values: 117, 154, 102, 67, 108, 121. The mean demand for these last 6 periods is 111.5 units. Period 29 (demand=67) appears to be a slight outlier or dip, but the overall trend remains high as we enter mid-September. On-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit), but there is a large pipeline (321 units). Specifically, orders from P28 (149 units) and P29 (147 units) are expected to arrive in P32 and P33 respectively, which should alleviate the stock-out risk. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while maintaining the standard safety stock calculation.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hoodie) is in its peak demand season (late August through September), which is consistent with the product type's category (hoodies) at the start of fall. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged approximately 112 units per period (117, 154, 102, 67, 108, 121, 115), despite some fluctuations and stock-outs. The lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent deliveries (P27 arrived in P31, P28 arrived in P32). Pipeline inventory is high (331 units), with significant arrivals expected in the coming periods (orders from P29-P32). I will set mu_hat to use the recent 7-period demand average to capture this peak regime while keeping sigma_hat slightly elevated to account for the volatility seen in P27 (154 units) versus P29 (67 units). The L parameter remains at 4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie (seasonal autumn/winter item) currently in its peak demand phase (September/October). Demand has consistently averaged ~110-120 units over the last 8 periods, with recent demand at 115 (P32) and 105 (P33). On-hand inventory is 77, and total in-transit is 339. Specifically, an order of 1 unit (P30) and 24 units (P31) are due soon, followed by larger orders of 159 (P32) and 155 (P33). Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (P33 conclude showed P29 order arrived). To maintain supply through the peak season and avoid the stockouts seen in August, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period mean (~106 units/period * (L+1)) and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering ~530 units (106 * 5).

Carry-over insight: September demand remains strong and stable, averaging ~112 units/period (P30-P33), confirming the hoodie category's peak season persists into Q4.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, entering October (Period 35), which typically sees rising demand for the garment category. Period 34 experienced a massive demand spike to 210 units, resulting in a stock-out (ending inventory 0). This is a significant jump from the previous plateau of ~112 units. Given the seasonality and the recent observation, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this higher demand level. I will use an explicit forecast roughly between the previous plateau and the recent peak to avoid over-ordering while still addressing the trend. Pipeline inventory is currently 478 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to conclude messages. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend maintains a high service level for this peak-season product while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Demand spiked to 210 units, significantly exceeding the previous seasonal plateau of ~112. This suggests either a deep seasonal peak or promotional influence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a hoodie, entering mid-October (Period 36), which is the heart of the autumn/winter season. A major demand regime shift occurred in Period 34 (210 units), and while Period 35 demand was lower at 67, this was severely capped by a starting on-hand inventory of only 24 units, resulting in a stock-out. True demand is likely still high. The 'Carry-over insights' note a shift at Period 34. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P31-P35) for mean demand: (121 + 115 + 105 + 210 + 67(stock-out)) / 5 = 123.6. However, given the supply constraint in P34 and P35, the true mean is likely closer to 135-140. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use recent_N=5 to capture the high-season demand level while providing a slightly aggressive mu_hat via 'explicit' to account for the stock-out dampened observations in the recent history, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-season; however, stock-outs in P34 and P35 (0 ending inventory) are masking true demand levels. Realized demand in P31-P33 averaged 113.6, while P34 saw a spike to 210.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Hoodie) is in its peak seasonal demand period as we head into late October. Historically, demand spiked significantly in late September (P34: 210 units). While P35 and P36 show lower realized demand (67 and 60 units), this reflects a normalization after the P34 spike, but still remains significantly higher than the spring/summer lows. The carry-over insights correctly identified a sustained high-demand regime since late June. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 99, with a large pipeline of 541 units (including a significant order of 155 from P33 arriving next period, and a large order of 223 from P35). To avoid over-ordering after the P34-P36 variance, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering P31-P36) which captures the high-season average (~115 units/period) while acknowledging the P34 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current volatility. This keeps the base stock high enough to prevent stock-outs during the autumn peak while managing the cost of the large incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak season plateau: demand from P31-P36 averaged ~113 units/period, despite a single-period spike of 210 in P34. Inventory pipeline is now heavily loaded to match this level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is in its peak seasonal demand period. Demand analysis shows a plateau after the initial transition; however, recent demand (P35-P37) has moderated slightly (67, 60, 74) compared to the extreme 210 in P34 or the previous ~113 average. This suggests the peak may be stabilizing or starting a slow decline as we enter late October. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P33 order arrived in P37). On-hand inventory is 180, and there is a large pipeline of 386 units (significantly boosted by the large P35 order of 223 units). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the high-season average (P31-P37) which is approximately 107 units, while allowing the OR backend to account for the recent lower observations. Sigma_hat is set to 3 to capture the volatility of this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late September/October; after reaching a peak, demand from P31-P37 averaged ~107 units. Total pipeline is currently high (386 units) to cover this high-demand expectation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November, and demand has notably cooled from the September/October peaks. Realized demand in the last four periods (P35-P38) has been 67, 60, 74, and 30, averaging 57.75 units/period. This is a significant drop from the ~113 avg seen earlier in the peak season. Currently, we have 290 units on-hand and 246 in-transit (total 536 units), while our current demand trajectory suggests a much lower inventory requirement. To avoid excessive holding costs as we likely pass the seasonal peak for hoodies, I am lowering mu_hat. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this cooling trend (average ~58 units per period). With lead time L=4, mu_hat becomes (1+4)*58 = 290. Since we have 536 units in the pipeline and on-hand, the OR backend will correctly stop ordering for now to allow inventory to deplete.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Post-peak cooling confirmed. Demand dropped from ~110 units to an average of ~58 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), a ~47% reduction.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hood) has transitioned out of its peak seasonal demand phase. After a volatile peak in September/October (where demand reached as high as 210 units), demand has significantly cooled. The most recent demand observation in P39 was 159 units, which follows a very low 30 units in P38. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand averaged 80.75 units, a clear drop from the peak plateau of ~112 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 354 units, and with the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), we must avoid over-ordering. The OR backend needs to be informed of this cooling trend to prevent building excessive stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this post-peak behavior (averaging ~81 units per period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling confirmed: Demand regime shifted after P34-P35; average demand for P36-P39 is ~81 units, down from the peak seasonal average of ~112 units. Inventory levels are currently high (354 units on-hand) relative to this new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the hoodie (SKU 685814003) is currently in a highly volatile post-peak phase. In Period 40 (2019/11/11), demand spiked to 190 units, contrasting with the lower levels observed in Periods 38 (30 units) and 36 (60 units). This suggests that while there is an overall cooling trend compared to the August-September peak, significant demand spikes remain possible in November. On-hand inventory is 187 units with 27 units in-transit (ordered P40), totaling 214 units of pipeline inventory. Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 102.6 units. To protect against recent spikes (like the 190 units in P40), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods) and N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen since late October. This ensures we don't over-order given the high holding cost and the cooling season trend, but remain responsive to late-season spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in November: while the general trend is cooling from the Sep peak, P40 saw a significant spike to 190 units, suggesting inconsistent late-season demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is experiencing highly volatile late-season demand. After a period of cooling (P38-P39), demand spiked significantly in P40 (190) and P41 (205), leading to a stock-out. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 248 units. Given the game is at Period 42 of 47, there are only 6 decision periods remaining. With a lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive in Period 46, impacting the final two periods of the game. The recent demand surge (average ~198 over the last two periods) contradicts the previous 'post-peak cooling' trend and suggests a secondary peak, likely due to late November/Black Friday shopping behavior. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (averaging ~185/period) to ensure we have enough stock to meet this unexpected surge, while maintaining the default lead time of 4 as deliveries remain consistent.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed in late November (P40-P41): demand increased from ~80 units to ~200 units, likely driven by holiday/Black Friday shopping for the hoodie category.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand holiday season for hoodies, as evidenced by a massive spike in demand reaching 404 units in Period 42. This follows a secondary peak observed in P40 (190) and P41 (205). The current inventory state is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back periods of stock-outs. The pipeline is robust at 472 units, but we need to ensure the base stock levels are set significantly higher to capture this surge, which is likely driven by Black Friday and upcoming December gift-giving. Given the volatility (demand jumped from ~80 to 404), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new holiday demand regime (averaging ~266 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Demand spiked aggressively to 404 units in late November (P42), following sustained increases in P40-P41. This represents a ~400% increase over the mid-October average demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday peak period. Demand reached a significant holiday peak of 404 units in Period 42 (late November), then dropped sharply to 73 in Period 43 (early December). The item (Richie Hood) likely experiences intense but high-variance demand during this season. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stock-outs from the massive Period 42 spike, but we have a massive pipeline of 935 units. Specifically, orders from Period 40 (27 units), Period 41 (221 units), Period 42 (224 units), and Period 43 (463 units) are in-transit. Based on the consistent lead time of 4, we expect 27 units to arrive this period (P44), 221 in P45, and 224 in P46. Given the drop from 404 to 73, we must avoid over-ordering, as the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1). We use a recent_N average for mu_hat to capture the shift from the peak back to a more sustainable, yet still elevated, seasonal level. Specifically, N=4 covers the volatility of the last month (190, 205, 404, 73). Pipeline (935) already significantly exceeds expected demand for the remaining 4 periods of the game (ending P47).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked at Period 42 (404 units) and showed a significant immediate cooling in Period 43 (73 units). Total pipeline (935) is extremely high relative to current observed demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the wake of a massive holiday peak (Black Friday/early Dec). While demand spiked to 404 in P42, it has cooled significantly to 73 (P43) and 129 (P44). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with a massive pipeline of 1,063 units. The backlog of orders from P41 (221 units), P42 (224 units), and P43 (463 units) are all expected to arrive over the next three periods (P45-P47). Given the game ends at P47, and we already have over 1,000 units in transit to cover what is likely a declining post-holiday demand (average of last 2 periods is 101), we are at extreme risk of high holding costs if we continue to order aggressively. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the post-peak cooling trend (avg ~200, but heavily skewed by P42). The goal now is to allow the existing pipeline to satisfy remaining demand and avoid further inventory build-up before the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: After the P42 peak of 404, demand averaged 101 units in P43-P44. Massive pipeline (1,063 units) currently exceeds projected demand for the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, meaning this is the second-to-last period of the game. Our primary goal is to maximize total profit while minimizing holding costs for the final period. The current 'In-transit' inventory is 842 units, and we have 84 units on-hand. Looking at the arrivals: the 224 units ordered in P42 are expected to arrive in P46 (this period's resolution), and the 463 units ordered in P43 are expected to arrive in P47 (next period). Since the game ends after Period 47, any order placed now (P46) would arrive in Period 50 (based on lead_time=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Furthermore, the existing pipeline (842 units) is already extremely large compared to the post-holiday demand (approx. 100-137 units/period). Therefore, the priority is to avoid ordering any more units to mitigate mounting holding costs. I will set the lead time to its promised 'default' of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the post-holiday demand cooling (P43-P45), which averages around 113 units per period. The OR backend's capped policy will see that the pipeline inventory (842) far exceeds the base stock calculated from these values, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday liquidation phase: Demand in P43-P45 stabilized at an average of 113 units following the P42 peak. Total pipeline of 842 units is sufficient to cover all remaining demand through P47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (Period 47). The game ends after this period's demand resolution. Currently, we have 197 units on-hand and 618 units in-transit. Historic lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Since any order placed today will arrive in Period 51 (long after the game ends), and our current on-hand inventory of 197 units far exceeds the recent average demand (approx. 113 units over P43-P46), ordering more would only increase holding costs without potential for additional profit. The objective is to maximize R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. With 197 units on-hand, we are virtually guaranteed to meet all demand in the final period while likely incurring a holding cost on the surplus. Therefore, the priority is to avoid adding any further cost. I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend generates a zero order.
