Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Madison skinny HW' trousers. The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeans). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 167.2 units, with a slight dip in the most recent week. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The goal for this initial period is to establish a pipeline based on the available data. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime as defined by the provided samples. For lead time, I will use the 'default' (promised = 4), as no shipment history exists yet to verify actual performance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Madison skinny HW (1)', a women's 5-pocket jeans item. Reviewing historical demand (starting 2019-01-07): 168, 172, 173, 123, 150. Period 1 demand was 203. The average demand across these 6 points is approximately 165 units per week. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 193 in-transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 Arrival Resolution (visible at Period 6 START). We are currently experiencing stockouts (203 demand in P1, 0 sold). To recover, we need to set base stock levels to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the 6 available data points, the mean is 164.8 and the standard deviation is 26.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the recent spike (203) while acknowledging the earlier baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Current on-hand is 0 with a total in-transit of 402 units (193 from P1, 209 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at P6). Historical demand samples (last 5) show a mean of ~147. Recent realized demand in P1 (203) and P2 (283) indicates a significant upward shift, likely due to a seasonal trend or promotion for 'Womens Everyday Collection' jeans in February. Specifically, the mean of the last 7 samples (including historical) is ~189, but the last 3 samples (150, 203, 283) average 212. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this sharp increase. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the last two periods. L remains at the default (4) as no orders have arrived yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~150 to ~240 (+60%) over the last two periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). For SKU 573085004, the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 3 periods, no orders have arrived yet (the Period 1 order is scheduled for Period 5 arrival), explaining the current on-hand inventory of 0 and high in-transit of 725 units. The demand data shows a significant regime shift. Initial samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~145 units. However, since P1 (mid-February), demand has jumped significantly to 203, 283, and 235 (avg ~240). This coincides with the transition into early spring for a women's denim product. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. For L, I will stick to the default promised lead time as there is no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday jeans). Looking at the history, demand shifted significantly around the start of February/March. The initial samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged 147 units/week. Since Period 1 (starting 2019-02-11), demand has averaged 237 units/week (203, 283, 235, 228), confirming a sustained +61% increase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1032 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6's conclude message). Since no orders have reached their promised lead time yet, we maintain L=4. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current active demand regime (mean ~237). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the volatility of this new regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand, which aligns with our current pipeline vs expected demand needs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed since 2019-02-11: mean demand increased from 147 to 237 (+61%) across 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the first shipment of 193 units from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. However, due to several periods of zero on-hand inventory, demand was consistently lost from Period 1-4. The confirmed demand regime change (starting 2019-02-11) shows a significant increase from ~150 to ~231 units per week across the last 5 samples (203, 283, 235, 228, 208). Given L=4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the pre-shift data. L is set to default (4) as the first observation matches the promise.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25 (Period 7). The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans (everday collection), showing a sustained demand shift since 2019-02-11. Historical samples (pre-Period 1) averaged 147. Since then (Periods 1-6), demand has been: 203, 283, 235, 228, 208, 193. The mean of these last 6 periods is 225.0, confirming the regime shift noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 saw Period 1's arrival, Period 6 saw Period 2's arrival). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this higher demand regime (avg 225/week). For sigma_hat, N=6 will reflect the increased volatility since the shift. I have 16 units on-hand and 1008 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), which covers the pipeline for the 4-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's denim item. Looking at history, lead times have been consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights (around P1-P4) saw demand jump to the 200-280 range, but the last two periods (P6: 193, P7: 137) show a downward trend. Specifically, P7 demand is significantly lower. Including the early 2019 samples (avg 157) and the recent shift, the mean demand of all 12 samples is approximately 181. Using recent_N=6 captures the high-demand period and the recent cooling (avg ~200). mu_hat should reflect (1+L) periods. With L=4, we need 5 periods of demand. Given the high pipeline (848 units) and on-hand (202), total position is 1050. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods of data to balance the recent high peak with the latest drop, ensuring we don't over-order into a potential post-peak seasonal lull.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Following the Feb-Mar spike, demand dropped from 200+ units to 137 in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand for this item (Womens Everyday Jeans) spiked in February and early March (avg ~230) but has significantly dropped over the last two weeks to 137 and 106. This suggests the peak season or initial launch surge has ended, moving into a lower-demand regime. Average demand for the most recent 3 periods is 145, compared to the previous peak average. On-hand inventory is high at 403 units, with a large pipeline of 653 units. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. Since we have sufficient stock and significant incoming inventory relative to the new, lower demand trend, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to reflect the 100-150 range and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. This will signal the OR backend to scale back ordering and avoid excessive holding costs as we enter this post-peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed starting Period 7 (2019-03-25): Mean demand decreased from ~210 to ~120 (-43%) over the last two periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-04-15. Based on historical demand data and product description (Women's skinny jeans), we have seen a significant demand shift. There was a peak in Feb-Mar (avg ~230) which has sharply declined starting in late March (Period 7: 137, Period 8: 106, Period 9: 54). The mean demand over the last three periods is approximately 99 units. The drop to 54 units in Period 9 suggests a move away from the high-demand spring phase. On-hand inventory is high at 567 units, and 435 units are still in-transit. Given lead_time=4, pipeline inventory covers 5 periods. With a downward trend, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect the recent downshift (N=3). This will allow the OR engine to recognize the surplus and minimize holding costs while the inventory levels normalize. Lead time calculation is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand downshift confirmed since Period 7 (2019-03-25): Mean demand decreased from ~210 to ~99 (-53%) over the last three periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens Everyday Jeans) is experiencing a sustained demand downshift that began on 2019-03-25 (Period 7). The mean demand over the last four periods (54, 60, 106, 137) is approximately 89 units, a significant decrease from the peak demand periods earlier in the season. Current on-hand inventory (667 units) combined with in-transit inventory (275 units) totals 942 units, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high inventory level relative to current demand, the goal is to avoid overstocking while adjusting the forecast parameters to reflect the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand trend and keep L at default.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Sustained demand downshift confirmed since Period 7 (2019-03-25): Mean demand decreased to ~89 units over the last 4 periods, down from ~210 previously. Inventory is currently high (940+ units pipeline vs ~90 demand).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. Historical demand for the Madison skinny jeans shows a significant and sustained downshift that began in late March (Period 7). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 80 units (137, 106, 54, 60, 44), which is much lower than the peak period average of ~210 units. Our on-hand inventory is currently 786 units, and there are 112 units in transit (ordered in P8, expected to arrive in P12). Given that the current inventory level (898 total units) is sufficient to cover over 11 periods of demand at the current rate of ~80 units per week, the OR engine should not place additional orders. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the downshift) will ensure the backend target is significantly lower than current stock, effectively pausing replenishment to avoid further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand downshift since Period 7 (2019-03-25) confirmed: Mean demand over last 5 periods dropped to ~80 units vs ~210 previously (-62%). Inventory is significantly overstocked relative to current demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' is experiencing a prolonged and severe demand downshift that began in late March (Period 7). Demand has dropped from a peak of ~240 units to only 35 units in Period 12. Currently, the system is significantly overstocked with 863 units on-hand, while the mean demand over the last 6 periods (since the shift) is approximately 73 units. Total pipeline inventory is exhausted (0 in-transit) as the last order from Period 8 arrived. Given the current on-hand inventory, there is enough stock to cover over 10 periods of current demand levels. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime and continue to allow the back-end to order 0 units by setting parameters that reflect the current low-demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Severe demand downshift sustained. 6-period mean (P7-P12) is 72.6 units, compared to the peak mean of 237 units. Current on-hand inventory (863 units) is extremely high relative to recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-753.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to experience a significant downward demand trend. The latest demand (Period 13) dropped to 22 units, bringing the 7-period average (starting Period 7) down to 65.4 units, compared to much higher historical demand. The on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 841 units, which covers over 12 periods of current average demand. Because the backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime will result in a negative 'order-up-to' level relative to current inventory, ensuring the OR engine places zero orders (ordered=0) as desired to burn off excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand downshift continues to intensify: 7-period mean (P7-P13) is 65.4 units, with the most recent period (P13) hitting a low of 22 units. Inventory remains extremely high (841 units).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085004 (women's jeans) has collapsed from a peak of ~240 units to just 19 units in the most recent period, confirming a severe seasonal downshift as we approach late May. The current on-hand inventory of 822 units is massive relative to the 8-period mean of ~60 units and the 2-period mean of ~20 units. With lead time stable at 4 periods, our 'pipeline inventory' needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current consumption rate of ~20 units/period, we have over 40 periods of stock on hand. The system is in a 'drain inventory' phase. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the significantly reduced requirement and continues to place zero orders. No shipments are currently in-transit, and no further orders should be triggered.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse stabilized at extremely low levels: 3-period mean (P12-P14) is 25.3 units, down from early-season peaks of 200+. On-hand inventory represents ~30+ weeks of supply.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens skinny jeans) has experienced a severe and sustained demand collapse since late March (Period 7). Demand has dropped from a peak mean of ~237 units to a recent 3-period average (P13-P15) of approximately 20 units per week. The current on-hand inventory of 803 units is extremely high, covering roughly 40 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There are no units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recently concluded arrivals (P12). Because the current inventory (803) far exceeds any reasonable safety stock level (Base Stock \u2248 (1+L) * mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) for the current low-demand regime, the goal is to stop all ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the downshift began) and L as default to allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock. The capped policy will naturally result in zero orders until the inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand collapse continues at floor levels; 5-period mean (P11-P15) is 27.8 units, a ~88% reduction from peak demand. On-hand inventory (803 units) is extremely high, representing nearly a year of stock at current rates.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (Women's Skinny Jeans) is currently in a severe and prolonged demand downshift that began in late March (Period 7). Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~210 units/period to a 5-period average (P12-P16) of 21.6 units, with the most recent observation being only 13 units. This seasonality is characteristic of basic denim items after a spring peak. On-hand inventory is currently 790 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 35 periods (nearly 9 months) of supply. Consequently, the priority is to halt all incoming replenishment to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand slowly depletes the surplus. I am setting L to the default (4) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent 'floor' demand regime. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current inventory (target ~130 vs 790 on-hand), effectively setting the order quantity to 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: 5-period mean (P12-P16) is 21.6 units, an approximate 90% decline from peak. Overstock is extreme (790 units vs ~22 demand).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) has experienced a significant demand collapse following a peak in February/March. Current demand has flattened at a 'floor' level, with the 5-period mean (P13-P17) at 17.2 units and the most recent observations consistently at 13 units. Inventory levels are extremely high (777 units on-hand), representing approximately 45-60 weeks of stock at current consumption rates. No orders are currently in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Given the substantial overstock and the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) relative to profit ($4.00/unit), the OR backend should continue to place zero orders. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect this stabilized floor demand, while maintaining the L=4 setting to accurately calculate the pipeline requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor stabilized significantly: 5-period mean (P13-P17) is 17.2 units, with the last two periods holding steady at 13 units. Inventory surplus remains extreme.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-747.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has reached a profound floor, hitting 6 units in the most recent period (2019-06-10). The 5-period mean (P14-P18) is now 14.0 units, down from early-season peaks exceeding 200 units. With 771 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, the inventory covers over 50 weeks of demand at current rates. Given the $1.00/unit/period holding cost vs. $4.00 profit, the priority remains to prevent any new orders from being triggered by the OR backend. I will use 'recent_5' for mu_hat (70 units for L+1) and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime. Since the cumulative lead-time inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 771 units, which is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock calculation even with conservative safety factors, the capped policy will result in an order of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update: 5-period mean (P14-P18) has dropped further to 14.0 units. Inventory surplus remains critical with ~55 weeks of supply on-hand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday Collection) continues to hover at absolute floor levels, with the most recent demand being 12 units (Period 19) and 6 units (Period 18). Currently, we have 759 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With an average demand of approximately 10-15 units per week, the current stock covers over 50 weeks of supply. The product description suggests a basic item (high waist skinny jeans), but the dramatic drop-off since late April (Period 13 onwards) indicates either a seasonal clearance or a total loss of trend relevance for this specific SKU. My objective remains to prevent any further orders through the OR backend, as we must liquidate the existing surplus before incurring more holding costs. Setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value (reflecting the 5-period mean of ~9 units) and maintaining the lead time at 4 periods will ensure the base stock remains far below the current 759 units on-hand, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update: 5-period mean (P15-P19) is 10.6 units, reflecting a complete collapse compared to early-season peak. Inventory surplus remains critical with ~70 weeks of supply at current rates.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085004 (women's jeans) has effectively collapsed as the summer season progresses (Period 21, July 1st), likely due to the product being a heavier denim item less suited for mid-summer weather. Recent demand has hit a new floor: the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show demand of 13, 13, 6, 12, and 3 units respectively. The mean demand for the last 5 weeks is 9.4 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 756 units, which at the recent consumption rate of ~10 units/week, represents over 75 weeks of supply. There is no pipeline inventory. To stop the OR engine from ordering more and to reflect the current stagnant demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5). This minimizes the base stock calculation, ensuring that no new orders are triggered while we burn through the massive surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update at Period 21: 5-period mean (P16-P20) has declined to 9.4 units/week. Inventory surplus remains extreme at 756 units (~75 weeks of supply).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Madison skinny HW' (slim-leg jeans) has entered a deep demand trough, typical for denim products during mid-summer (July). Demand has consistently hovered between 3-12 units over the last five periods (P17-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 751 units, which at the current 5-period average demand of ~7.8 units/week, represents nearly 100 weeks of supply. No orders have been placed since Period 8, and none are in transit. The primary goal remains to avoid any further procurement until this massive inventory surplus is cleared. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to reflect the current floor-level demand, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update at Period 22: 5-period mean (P17-P21) is 7.8 units/week, confirming a sustained summer trough (~96% reduction from peak). Inventory surplus remains extreme (751 units).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is in a deep seasonal trough, with Period 22 demand reaching a low of 2 units. The 5-period mean is 5.6 units, reflecting a demand collapse of ~97% from the spring peak. On-hand inventory (749 units) is extremely excessive, covering over 130 weeks of supply at current rates. Given the massive surplus and minimal holding cost pressure compared to the cost of ordering more stock, the goal remains to prevent any new orders until inventory levels normalize. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture the current demand floor, ensuring the base stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand plus pipeline total.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update at Period 23: 5-period mean (P18-P22) has further declined to 5.6 units/week, representing the absolute seasonal minimum. Inventory surplus remains critical at 749 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-204.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (2019-07-15), demand spiked significantly to 109 units after a sustained floor of <10 units for several months. This appears to be the start of a late July/early August seasonal shift, potentially related to 'Back to School' or early Autumn inventory replenishment for 'Womens Everyday Collection' jeans. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory remains very high at 640 units. With current demand at 109 and the previous weeks averaging <10, the safety stock is more than sufficient. I will adjust mu_hat using a recent_N window that captures this new activity (N=3) to allow the OR backend to recognize the shift, while maintaining L=4 as lead times have consistently been 4 periods when orders were active. No new orders will be triggered by the backend due to the massive inventory surplus, which is the desired outcome to minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike detected in Period 23 (2019-07-15): Demand jumped to 109 units after a 10-week period averaging <15 units, suggesting the start of a seasonal recovery or 'Back to School' peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (2019-07-15), demand spiked to 109 units, followed by 73 units in Period 24. This marks a significant departure from the 'summer trough' where demand averaged ~5 units per week, aligning with the expected 'Back to School' seasonal recovery for basic trousers/denim. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory remains very high at 567 units. With recent demand averaging ~91 over the last two weeks, 567 units still represents over 6 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are required yet to satisfy the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this new demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonal recovery confirmed starting Period 23 (2019-07-15): Demand jumped from a 10-week average of <15 units to a 2-period average of 91 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens Trousers) has clearly entered a 'Back to School' seasonal recovery phase starting from 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Demand in the last three periods has been 109, 73, and 89, averaging 90.3 units per week. This is a massive shift from the summer trough where demand was consistently below 15 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-12). Despite the demand spike, current on-hand inventory is 478 units. At the current mean of ~90 units/week, 478 units represents approximately 5.3 weeks of supply. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the review cycle is 1 (Total coverage needed = L+1 = 5), the on-hand inventory is currently sufficient to cover the pipeline until a new order arrives. Therefore, the goal for the OR backend is to monitor if current stock meets the base stock level (estimated at (L+1)*mu + buffer). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the 90.3 unit average. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (std dev) seen during this sudden spike phase. No immediate order is likely needed due to the existing overstock, but parameters must reflect the new reality to prevent future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Back to School demand regime sustained for 3 periods: Mean demand since Period 23 (2019-07-15) is 90.3 units/week, up from a summer trough of <10 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens Everyday 5-pocket jeans) is exhibiting a strong seasonal recovery aligned with the 'Back to School' period. Since 2019-07-15 (Period 23), demand has shifted from a summer floor of <10 units to a 4-period sequence of 109, 73, 89, and 204 units (latest). The Period 26 demand of 204 units signals an intensification of this recovery. My on-hand inventory is 274 units, which at the latest demand rate (~200/wk) plus historical volatility, is now insufficient to cover the promised 4-period lead time plus a review period (L+1=5). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, avoiding dilution from the summer trough. The OR backend will see that (On-hand 274 + In-transit 8) < Target and will initiate necessary replenishment. L remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Significant Back to School demand acceleration confirmed: Period 26 demand spiked to 204 units, bringing the 4-period average since seasonal recovery (P23-P26) to 118.8 units, compared to the summer floor of <10 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back to School/Fall peak has arrived with significant intensity. In Period 27 (2019-08-12), demand spiked to 440 units, a massive increase from already elevated levels in the preceding weeks. We are currently out of stock (on-hand = 0) following Period 27, though we have 224 units in-transit (8 units from P26 + 216 units from P27), which are not expected to arrive for several more weeks given the 4-period lead time. The demand regime has shifted dramatically: whereas Period 23-26 averaged ~119 units, Period 26-27 averaged 322 units. Given the seasonality of '5-pocket jeans' in late August, this peak is likely sustained or could increase further before stabilizing. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P24-P27) to capture this rapid acceleration. This results in a mean of (73+89+204+440)/4 = 201.5 units per period. Over the lead time (1+L=5), this creates a base stock requirement to cover ~1000 units. Since we only have 224 in-transit and 0 on-hand, the OR backend will place a significant order to catch up to this new regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods as history has shown it to be stable.

Carry-over insight: Back to School demand peak intensified sharply in August: Period 27 demand reached 440 units, bringing the 5-period average since seasonal recovery (P23-P27) to 183 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a sharp Back to School seasonal peak for women's 5-pocket jeans. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has surged to 204, 440, and 414 units respectively. The 3-period average is 352.6 units, while the 5-period average since the recovery started (P24-P28) is 244 units. We are currently out of stock on-hand with 705 units in the pipeline (8 units from P26 + 216 units from P27 + 481 units from P28). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been historically stable. Given the intense demand and current stockout, I must set mu_hat to cover the peak. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~353). Under the formula (1+L)*mu, with L=4, this targets 5 periods of demand (approx 1,765 units). Since pipeline is only 705, the OR backend will place significant orders to close this gap and return to the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Back to School peak intensified: Demand sustained at >400 units for two consecutive periods (P27-P28), with a 3-period mean (P26-P28) of 352.6 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a significant seasonal demand peak, likely driven by 'Back to School' shopping (Late August/Early September). After reaching a peak near 440 units, demand has slightly tapered but remains very high (329 units in Period 29). The 3-period average (P27-P29) is 394 units. Lead-time performance has been historically stable at 4 periods, although we are waiting for the first wave of replenishment orders (placed starting P26) to arrive. The first small order from P26 is expected to arrive in P30's arrival resolution, but it won't be seen as 'concluded' until P31. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand is significantly exceeding previous trough levels, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime (mean ~394). I will use explicit L=4 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the promised lead time during this stockout phase. This will trigger orders that account for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Back to School peak plateau: Demand has sustained at high levels (>300 units) for three consecutive periods (P27-P29), with an average of 394.3 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back to School/Autumn seasonal peak is in full effect, with demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) averaging 410 units (440, 414, 329, 457). This represents a massive shift from the summer trough. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and while there is a large pipeline (1753 units), the immediate stockout persists. To maximize reward given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this sustained high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent levels to account for the high volatility seen during this peak (329 to 457 range). Orders from P27-P30 are expected to arrive in Periods 31-34, which should eventually resolve the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: mean demand from P27-P30 is 410 units, a sustained high-demand regime following the Back to School recovery.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a sustained high-demand regime following the 'Back to School' peak. Period 31 demand was 306 units, following a peak of over 400. The 5-period mean (P27-P31) is 389.2 units. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a large pipeline of 1,941 units (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Based on the stable observed lead time of 4 periods, the P28 order (481 units) is expected to arrive during Period 32 (visible in P33), and the P29 order (566 units) during Period 33. To maintain this demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current plateau. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat based on the same recent regime (N=5) to account for the high volatility observed during this autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau sustained: 5-period mean (P27-P31) is 389.2 units per week. Pipeline is heavily loaded with 1,941 units to cover this sustained demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Back to School/Autumn phase for this SKU (Womens Everyday Jeans). Demand has been consistently high for several weeks, peaking at 457 units in Period 30 but showing a cooling trend in the most recent period (Period 32 demand was 159). The 5-period average (P28-P32) is 333 units. However, recent demand of 306 and 159 suggests the seasonal peak is tapering off. We are currently well-stocked with 322 units on-hand and a massive pipeline of 1,593 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the signal that demand is slowing down, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand forecasting to capture the high recent volume while acknowledging the deceleration. This will allow the OR engine to cap orders effectively, preventing excessive overstock as the season continues to transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed post-Autumn peak: Period 32 demand dropped to 159 from a 4-period high average of 410 (P27-P30). Pipeline is heavily saturated with ~1600 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is exhibiting high volatility following a primary seasonal 'Back to School' peak. Demand soared to over 400 units/week in late August/early September and has since fluctuated: dropping to 159 (P32) then rebounding to 284 (P33). Current inventory levels are exceptionally high, with 604 units on-hand and an additional 1,027 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak). Given that recent demand (last 2 periods average = 221.5) is significantly lower than the peak average, but remains well above the summer floor, I am using a recent 4-period window to capture this post-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With a pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 1,631 units, which covers ~7-8 weeks of current demand, the goal is to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a service level for the sustained autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand transition detected: Demand has moved from a peak of ~410 units (P27-P30) to highly volatile levels averaging ~222 units over the last two periods (P32-P33). Pipeline is heavily saturated (1,631 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens Everyday Jeans) is entering a post-peak demand phase following the 'Back to School' / Autumn surge (Periods 27-31). Demand has significantly dropped from a peak of 410 units to a 3-period average of 189.7 units (P32-P34: 159, 284, 126). We currently have an extremely high on-hand inventory of 968 units and an additional 644 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 1,612 units). Given the recent demand mean of ~190, the current pipeline covers more than 8 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current downward trend. This will set a lower base stock, effectively pausing new orders until the existing stock is depleted to a level aligned with the new, lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: 3-period mean (P32-P34) is 189.7 units, down from the Autumn peak mean of 410 units (-54%). Inventory is currently overstocked (1,612 units in pipeline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-897.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-Autumn peak 'cooling off' phase. Demand has significantly decreased from the August/September peaks (which exceeded 400 units/week) to a more moderate level. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P32-P35) is 166 units, with the most recent period (P35) showing a further dip to 95 units. Inventory is currently extremely high: on-hand inventory (1277) plus in-transit (240) equals 1517 units, which at the recent average demand of ~166 units, covers over 9 weeks of supply. Given the 4-period lead time, we are heavily overstocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current downward trend, allowing the system to naturally burn through the existing inventory without placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn peak demand deceleration confirmed: 4-period mean (P32-P35) is 166 units, a ~60% reduction from the P27-P31 peak average of ~389 units. Inventory is currently in a significant surplus position.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (Womens Everyday Jeans) is in a clear post-Autumn peak deceleration phase. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~410 units (P27-P30) to a more stable 'cool-down' regime. The last five periods (P32-P36) show demands of 159, 284, 126, 95, and 79, with a clearly declining trend. The 4-period mean (P33-P36) is 146 units, but the most recent two periods (P35-P36) average only 87 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,331 units, which covers approximately 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (~87 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the declining demand trend typical of post-seasonal peaks for everyday denim, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent deceleration while maintaining a conservative buffer. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn peak demand deceleration sustained: 5-period mean (P32-P36) is 148.6 units, but the last 2 periods (P35-P36) have dropped to a mean of 87 units, signaling a return to pre-peak baseline levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085004 has transitioned from an Autumn peak (avg ~410) to a significantly lower post-peak baseline. Over the last three periods (P35-P37), demand has stabilized at a much lower level with observations of 95, 79, and 80 units (mean = 84.7). Current on-hand inventory is 1251 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 14-15 weeks\u2014far exceeding the lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline also contains 107 units from Period 34. Given this massive surplus, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect this new stabilized baseline (approx 85 units/week * 5 weeks = 425) and sigma_hat using recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn peak demand has stabilized at a new baseline: 3-period mean (P35-P37) is 84.7 units, down from the peak of ~410 units (-79%). Current inventory levels are extremely high relative to this new demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained post-Autumn peak demand regime. The 5-period mean (P34-P38) is 89.4 units, and the 3-period mean (P36-P38) has stabilized further at 75.3 units. With on-hand inventory at 1,291 units and zero units in transit, the current stock covers approximately 17 weeks of demand at recent rates. The game history confirms the actual lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current low-demand floor, the goal is to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a base stock level that reflects the new regime. I am selecting recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this stabilized post-peak baseline while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock and order quantity (which will likely be zero due to the significant surplus).

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn demand has stabilized at a floor regime since Period 35: 4-period mean (P35-P38) is 80.25 units. Inventory is in extreme surplus (~16 weeks cover).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-961.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (Womens skinny jeans) has entered a stable post-Autumn floor regime. For the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has been consistent with a mean of 77.4 units (95, 79, 80, 67, 66). Inventory currently stands at 1,225 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the current average demand of ~77 units per week, the existing stock levels provide approximately 15.8 weeks of cover, which is well above the required safety stock for a 4-period lead time. No new orders are necessary. I am setting L to default (4 periods) and mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn demand floor stabilized: 5-period mean (P35-P39) is 77.4 units, representing a return to a baseline regime after the mid-year peak. Inventory levels are extremely high relative to this demand (15+ weeks of cover).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand was [79, 80, 67, 66, 26], with a 5-period mean of 63.6 units/week. The most recent demand of 26 units in P40 is notably low, possibly indicating a further seasonal taper or a typical variation in this stabilized regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P34 arrival in P38). Current on-hand inventory is 1,199 units with no units in transit. Given the current 5-period mean (63.6), this inventory represents approximately 18-19 weeks of supply. To minimize holding costs and prevent further overstocking during this low-demand phase, the OR parameters reflect this sustained baseline mean and stability. No new orders are needed as the inventory drastically exceeds any reasonable safety stock requirements.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1104.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained late-year demand floor. The demand for the last five periods (P37-P41) has been 80, 67, 66, 26, and 19 units, yielding a 5-period mean of 51.6 units and a 2-period mean of 22.5 units. The significant drop in the last two weeks suggests the market for 'Madison skinny HW' (light washed denim jeans) has reached its seasonal minimum. On-hand inventory is currently 1,180 units with zero in-transit, which covers more than 20 weeks of demand at current rates (averaging ~50 units/week) or over 50 weeks at the most recent rate (~22 units/week). Given the game ends at Period 47 and we are at Period 42, we are in a massive surplus position ($1180 units vs. ~300 units likely demand for the remainder of the game). To stop incurring unnecessary holding costs and minimize further ordering, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat low using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand collapse, though no new orders will be triggered by the OR backend given the extreme pipeline/on-hand surplus. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline since P37: 5-period mean (P37-P41) fell to 51.6 units, with the most recent 2 periods (P40-P41) averaging just 22.5 units, signaling a transition from the post-peak floor to an end-of-season minimum.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final stretch of the season (Period 43 of 47). Current demand is exhibiting a very low and volatile end-of-season behavior. Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 83 units, but the preceding weeks (P40-P41) were significantly lower (26 and 19 units). The 5-period mean (P38-P42) is 52.2 units. With 1,097 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, the current inventory level covers roughly 21 times the recent average weekly demand. Given that there are only 5 periods left in the simulation, it is mathematically impossible to sell through the current stock even if demand doubled. The goal now is to prevent any further orders and minimize holding costs, although since on-hand already exceeds any reasonable base stock, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime, ensuring the calculated base stock remains far below the current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor: 5-period mean (P38-P42) is 52.2 units, despite a minor spike in P42. Inventory is in extreme surplus with over 20 weeks of supply for the 5 remaining periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The simulation is nearing its end (Period 47). The demand for this product (women's 5-pocket jeans) has transitioned into a late-season trough, with the 5-period mean (P39-P43) sitting at 45.8 units. Although there was a brief spike in Period 42 (83 units), the latest demand recorded was 35 units. Most importantly, the on-hand inventory is 1,062 units. Given the recent demand average, this represents over 20 weeks of supply, which far exceeds the remaining 4 periods of the game. My primary objective is to avoid any further orders and minimize holding costs while the existing stock satisfies the remaining demand. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent lower-volume regime to ensure the OR engine does not trigger a 'safety stock' order despite the massive surplus, though the capped policy should inherently prevent ordering given the current stock level.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand trough sustained: 5-period mean (P39-P43) is 45.8 units, confirming a significant decline from the post-peak floor. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (1000+ units) relative to remaining periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late season (Period 45 of 47, date 2019/12/16). Current on-hand inventory is 1030 units, which vastly exceeds the current demand levels (5-period mean = 45.8 units). At the current rate, we have enough stock to cover over 20 weeks of demand, while only 3 periods remain in the game. Demand has stabilized at a low end-of-season floor. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, but since the game ends at Period 47, any orders placed now would not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, the primary objective is to liquidate the existing surplus while avoiding further holding costs. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring no new orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-955.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46, which is late December (2019/12/23). Historical demand for this SKU (women's jeans) has shown a significant end-of-season decline. The 5-period mean demand (P41-P45) is 36.8 units per week. The available on-hand inventory is 1,015 units, which provides over 25 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate, while only one period remains in the game. There are no shipments in transit. Given the massive inventory surplus and the impending end of the game, no further orders are required. The OR parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime using a recent 5-period average (N=5) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation does not trigger unnecessary orders, acknowledging that the pipeline is already more than sufficient.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor sustained through Period 45: 5-period mean demand (P41-P45) is 36.8 units. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (1000+ units) relative to the final game period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-950.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the game based on the '47 / 47' status. The current on-hand inventory is 1,002 units, which is extremely high (nearly 80 times the most recent demand of 13 units). Demand has been in a sustained end-of-season trough for several weeks, with a 5-period mean of 36.8 units (P41-P45) and the most recent demand (P46) dropping further to 13 units. Given the massive overstock and the fact that this is the final period, the priority is to avoid any further inventory accumulation to minimize holding costs. Any order placed now would arrive well after the game concludes. Therefore, I am maintaining zero orders by keeping parameters conservative, though the OR engine will naturally not order given the high on-hand stock and low demand forecast.
