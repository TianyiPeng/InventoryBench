The average demand over these 5 weeks is 119.8 units, but the most recent figure is significantly higher (157). The current date is Feb 11, moving into the spring season when demand for 'Everyday' denim typically remains stable or grows slightly. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my pipeline must cover (L+1) periods (the current period plus the 4-period lead time), I need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average (~130-140) to be safe across 5 periods: 140 * 5 = 700. I will order 700 units to establish a baseline inventory to satisfy demand starting around Period 5.",

This cleared the entire on-hand inventory (541 units) and resulted in a stockout. Historical data from early December (Period 1-4) showed demand around 150-170 units. Currently, there is an in-transit order of 200 units placed in Period 42, which is expected to arrive in Period 46 (given the confirmed 4-period lead time). With 0 on-hand inventory and the game ending at Period 47, I need to cover demand for Periods 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47. Assuming a post-Black Friday normalization to ~150 units/period (the pre-peak baseline), total remaining demand is approximately 750 units. Pipeline current: 200 (due P46). Gap: ~550 units. I will order 550 units now to arrive in Period 47, which is the final arrival window possible.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is women's skinny jeans. We just experienced the Black Friday hyper-peak (Period 42: demand 1007) and the subsequent Cyber Monday/holiday week (Period 43: demand 771). We are currently in early December (Period 44). Historically, following the late-September peak, the demand baseline settled around 130-150 units. However, current demand is heavily elevated due to the holiday season. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of 200 units (ordered Period 42, expected Period 46) and 550 units (ordered Period 43, expected Period 47). Since the total duration of the game is 47 periods, orders placed now (Period 44) with a lead time of 4 would arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs and provide no revenue. I must stop ordering and rely on the 750 units already in transit to fulfill demand for the remaining 4 periods (44, 45, 46, 47).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday peak demand (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) confirmed with massive spikes in P42 (1007) and P43 (771). All future orders will arrive after the game end (Period 47) due to 4-period lead time.",

Any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49 (45 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion. Therefore, no new orders should be placed as they would only incur procurement costs without the possibility of being sold. My current inventory assessment shows 0 on-hand and 750 in-transit. The in-transit units are from Period 42 (200 units) and Period 43 (550 units). Following the 4-period lead time, the 200 units from P42 are expected to arrive in Period 46 (which I will see in the P47 start observation), and 550 units from P43 are expected to arrive in Period 47 (which I will not be able to sell as the game ends at the conclusion of P47). Demand has returned to a post-holiday baseline (88 units in P44).

Consequently, any order placed now (Period 47) would not arrive until Period 51, which is outside the game's horizon. In the current Period 47, we have 148 units on-hand. Looking at recent demand post-holiday peak (P44: 88, P45: 77, P46: 52), demand is trending downward back toward a stable winter baseline. The 148 units on-hand are more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for this final period without incurring unnecessary holding costs on additional inventory that cannot be sold within the game timeframe.
