Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a SKU of women's everyday skinny jeans. Historical demand data (samples from Jan 7 to Feb 11) shows a clear upward trend: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157. This suggests a transition from a stable post-holiday phase into a ramping phase, possibly due to spring collection introductions or seasonal shifts in February. The promised lead time is 4 weeks. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, warranting a relatively high service level. Since we are starting with 0 inventory (on-hand and in-transit), the goal is to establish a pipeline. I will use the recent trend to set mu_hat. Specifically, N=3 captures the most recent growth (avg 132.3), providing a more responsive baseline than the 5-week average (119.8).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The sample demand data shows a clear upward trend leading into February (101, 101, 117, 123, 157). The actual demand in Period 1 was 150, confirming this high-level plateau. Inventory is currently critical (on-hand is 0) because the Period 1 order (168 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). To maximize profit and manage the stockout risk, I will use a shorter 'recent_N' window (N=3) for demand mean and volatility calculation to capture the recent spike (123, 157, 150) rather than the lower January figures. Lead time is set to default as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing a SKU described as 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans). Historical data from Jan/Feb shows an upward trend in demand: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157. The more recent demand in Period 1 and 2 was 150 and 177 respectively, which confirms a shift to a higher demand regime compared to the early January baseline. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders from Period 1 (168 units) and Period 2 (173 units) are currently in-transit; with L=4, we do not expect the Period 1 order to arrive until Period 5's resolution phase (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales. To capture the recent upward trend and seasonality (approaching Spring), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on the last 4 periods (including the two game periods), where demand averages roughly 151.75. Given L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting mid-February: average demand increased from ~110 to ~150-170 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU 562245018 has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival in Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 'conclude' message). Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 530 units (168 + 173 + 189). Recent demand since mid-February (Periods 1, 2, and 3) has been 150, 177, and 164, averaging 163.67. This confirms the previously noted demand shift from the early January average of ~110. For Period 4 parameters: L is kept at 'default' (4 weeks). mu_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand regime of ~164 units per week, which the OR engine will multiply by (1+L) = 5. sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Periods 1-3 average demand is 163.7, significantly higher than the Jan baseline of 110.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans). Historical data from January (average ~110) vs. game history (Weeks 1-4 average ~163) confirms a significant demand regime shift. I will use N=4 to capture this new level. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we placed our first order in Period 1, we expect the first arrival during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 716 units. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given L=4, we need to cover 5 periods. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the ~163 average (approx 815 for 5 periods), and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat will capture the volatility within this higher-demand period to maintain a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time L=4, we must plan for a (1+L) = 5 period window. Demand analysis: The January baseline was ~110 units/week. Since February (Period 1), demand has shifted upward to a stable regime. Observed demand for Periods 1-5: 150, 177, 164, 161, 152. The mean of these 5 periods is 160.8. The current on-hand inventory is low (16), but the in-transit pipeline is healthy (668 units), covering future demand for about 4 weeks. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, and keep L at default (4) as confirmed by the Period 5 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 1 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~161 units (up from ~110), representing a consistent +46% increase.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Collection skinny jeans) showed a regime shift in mid-February, moving from a mean of ~110 to a higher plateau of ~161 units per period. The last 6 periods have shown demand values of 150, 177, 164, 161, 152, and 148, which confirms a stable high-demand regime. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (Period 1 arrived in Period 5; Period 2 arrived in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 41, and there is a large pipeline of 636 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.8, which targets a high service level. I will use the last 6 samples (the entire high-demand regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to ensure the 'base_stock' covers the expected demand over the (L+1) = 5 period window.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). On-hand inventory is 0 after a massive demand spike of 366 units in Period 7 (Date 2019/3/25), which resulted in 136 lost sales. Looking at the data, the product is 'Luna skinny RW', a basic denim item. The spike occurred the week before April 1st, potentially signaling the start of a Spring seasonal peak or a promotional event. The average demand across Periods 1-6 was ~158, while Period 7 represents a 2.3x increase over that average. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and the current pipeline showing consistent arrivals (Period 5-7 arrivals followed the 4-period schedule), I expect the Period 4 order (186 units) to arrive during Period 8. To address the recent volatility and the risk of sustained higher demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to give more weight to the recent higher volume periods (152, 148, 366). Sigma_hat will be set to 'default' as the standard calculation across current samples already captures the recent 366 spike, leading to a higher safety stock. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 7 (366 units), increasing the short-term mean from ~160 to ~200+ units. Likely start of Spring seasonality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is women's 5-pocket jeans. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: Jan baseline was ~100-110, Feb/March stabilized at ~160, and late March/early April has spiked to 366 and 235 units. This aligns with Spring fashion seasonality. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P7 and P8, meaning there is significant unfulfilled demand. Pipeline inventory is 721 units (orders from P5-P8). To account for the recent seasonal surge, I am using the average of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) which is ~225 units/period. For mu_hat, this translates to (1+L) * 225 = 5 * 225 = 1125. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of this seasonal spike. Setting L to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak confirmed: Demand averaged 300 units over P7-P8, a significant increase from the 160-unit baseline in early Q1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are in a confirmed demand regime shift linked to Spring seasonality for this 'Everyday Collection' denim product. While demand peaked in Period 7 (366) and Period 8 (235), Period 9 saw a drop to 160. However, on-hand inventory has been zero for three consecutive periods, meaning actual demand in Period 9 (160) was constrained by the 120 units available. The carry-over insights correctly identified a surge, but the last few weeks' average (P7-P9) is approx 253 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My L is confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. \u03bc\u0302 is set to 1250 units (250 units/week * 5 weeks) to capture the higher Spring demand while acknowledging the slight cooling from the initial spike. \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility shown during this seasonal shift, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this profitable SKU (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand for Everyday Collection denim established: mean demand shifted from ~160 to ~250 units starting late March (Period 7), with high volatility peaking at 366 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245018' is a pair of skinny jeans from the 'Everyday Collection'. Current date is April 22, 2019. We are observing high demand (mean ~217 over P7-P10) compared to early Q1. In-transit inventory is high (1268 units) because we placed large orders in P8, P9, and P10 to chase the demand spike seen in P7 (366 units). However, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand = 0 for 4 consecutive periods) because those larger orders are still in transit (L=4). Demand in P9 and P10 stabilized around 150-160, suggesting the P7-P8 spike might have been a concentrated seasonal peak or holiday-related (Easter was April 21, 2019). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher Spring demand level (avg ~227) and volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a safety stock while these large orders arrive. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (366 units) and Period 8 (235 units), which prompted a higher base stock level in previous periods. However, demand in Period 9 (160), Period 10 (148), and Period 11 (152) has stabilized back to the Q1 mean of approximately 150-160 units. This suggests the 'Spring peak' for this specific denim item was short-lived or a localized event. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a large in-transit pipeline (1187 units). Arrivals have consistently followed the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since demand has returned to a stable regime (avg ~153 over last 3 periods), I will use N=3 to adjust the forecast downward, preventing excessive ordering as the pipeline arrives. The lead time (L) remains 4 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: The Period 7-8 demand spike has subsided; demand for Periods 9-11 averaged 153.3 units, returning to the early Q1 baseline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and historical data signifies a return to the early Q1 baseline demand (approx. 150-160 units/period) after a significant seasonal peak in late March/early April. Demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) has been 160, 148, 152, and 157, showing high stability (mean = 154.25). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals in Periods 5-12. With an on-hand inventory of 165 and a massive pipeline of 865 units (orders from P9, P10, P11 are 393, 415, and 57 respectively), the total coverage is current inventory + pipeline = 1030 units. Given the projected demand of ~154 units per period across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the target stock should be roughly 770-800 units. The pipeline alone significantly exceeds this target, primarily due to large orders placed during the seasonal 'panic' phase in P9-P10. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable post-peak demand regime and default lead time settings. The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period to allow the excess pipeline to be absorbed.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th (Period 14). Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim has stabilized following a significant spring spike (366 units in late March). For the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 152 units with low volatility (std \u2248 6), suggesting a return to the early Q1 baseline. The pipeline is currently full, with 415 units on-hand and 472 units in-transit (orders from P10 and P11 are expected to arrive in P14 and P15). Specifically, the arrived=393 units from P9 and the arrival of P8's 322 units have created a surplus. With lead time (L) consistently at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current stabilized demand of ~152 units per period over the 1+L window (5*152 = 760). Since on-hand (415) + in-transit (472) = 887, and we target a base stock around 760 + safety stock, the order will naturally be zero or very low, allowing the high inventory level to normalize and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The Spring seasonal peak for this denim SKU (represented by the high demand in Periods 7 and 8) has concluded. Demand has stabilized at a lower level over the last four periods (mean of ~131 units), with the most recent demand being 111. High safety stock ordered during the peak (Periods 9 and 10) has now arrived, resulting in an on-hand inventory of 719 units. Given the recent demand average, this represents over 5 weeks of stock, which is more than sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. I will setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 4 to reflect the post-peak demand regime (Periods 11-14), which ensures the base stock calculation reflects current lower consumption rates rather than the historical peak, helping to prevent further overstocking and minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring seasonal regime: Demand has decreased from the peak (~250-300 units) to a stable baseline of ~131 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Womens Everyday Collection denim) has entered a stable post-Spring seasonal regime. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) shows demand has normalized significantly from the Spring peak: daily demands were 152, 157, 143, 111, and 96, netting an average of 131.8 units. The downward trend suggests demand is returning to or slightly below the early Q1 baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (680 units) due to large orders placed during the Spring peak (P8-P10) arriving now. With no units in transit and a current on-hand balance that covers over 5 periods of average demand (680 / 131.8 \u2248 5.16), the target is to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for the (L+1) = 5 period outlook. I will use N=5 for the demand mean and standard deviation to capture this cooling trend. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring seasonal regime confirmed: Demand has trended downwards from Period 12, averaging 131.8 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) compared to the ~250-300 unit peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that the 'Spring seasonal peak' for this Everyday Collection denim SKU occurred in late March/April (Periods 7-10) and has since significantly subsided. Demand in the last five periods (P12-P16) was 157, 143, 111, 96, and 64, showing a clear downward trend towards a summer baseline. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (616 units) relative to recent demand, as large orders from the peak period (P9, P10) arrived while demand was cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages. Given the inventory surplus (on-hand + pipeline covers demand well beyond the L+1 window of ~450-500 units), I will set mu_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime to prevent unnecessary ordering. We use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 114.2) and sigma_hat to capture the recent cooling trend and stabilize inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to Summer baseline: Demand significantly declined through May (P13-P16), averaging 103.5 units, compared to the P9-P12 average of 203.5 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim has significantly cooled after the Spring peak, entering a Summer trough. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 94.6 units (143, 111, 96, 64, 59), with a clear downward trend. Currently, there are 557 units on-hand and 30 units in-transit (ordered P16). Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current demand rate is under 100 units/period, the pipeline (587 units) is more than sufficient to cover expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). L remains at the promised 4 periods as consistent performance is observed. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (period 13 to 17) to capture the contemporary lower demand baseline, and sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect reduced volatility compared to the Spring spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand for P13-P17 averaged 94.6 units, showing a 40% reduction from the P11-P14 baseline (~153 units) and a ~65% reduction from the Spring peak (~250-300 units).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline since the Spring peak (Period 7-8). The demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) has been 111, 96, 64, 59, and 55, averaging 77 units per week, with a clear downward trend settling into a 'Summer trough' around 55-60 units. Current on-hand inventory is high at 502 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods and demand is low, the inventory position (502 on-hand + 30 in-transit) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods (estimated at ~300 units). I am choosing recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent low-demand regime (avg ~77) while allowing the OR backend to handle the high on-hand stock by likely placing zero orders. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in this stable low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed and stabilizing: Period 16-18 demand averaged 59 units, representing a further decline from the May average of ~100 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24th, 2019. We are in a sustained summer demand trough for women's skinny jeans. Recent demand (P16-P19) has averaged 58.75 units per period (64, 59, 55, 57), showing very low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 445 units, which covers approximately 7.5 periods of demand at the current rate (445 / 59 = 7.54). Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. The OR engine needs parameters that recognize this downturn to avoid further orders while waiting for on-hand stock to deplete. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current baseline of ~59 units. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to capture the low current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'calculate' as actual arrivals have consistently followed the 4-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed and stable: Period 16-19 demand averaged 58.8 units with low volatility, representing a ~40% decrease from the May baseline of ~100 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The 'Luna skinny RW' jeans (Womens Everyday Collection) has transitioned from a high-demand Spring period (P7-P11) into a stable Summer trough. Period 20 demand was 33 units, continuing the low-demand trend observed since Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 53.6 units, significantly lower than previous months. On-hand inventory is currently high at 442 units, which is enough to cover over 8 periods of demand at the current rate (53.6 units/period). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further ordering until the excess inventory is cleared, while setting parameters that reflect the current low-demand/low-volatility Summer regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering unneeded orders. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized Summer baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough stabilized in June: demand for P16-P20 averaged 53.6 units, a ~65% reduction from the Spring baseline. Inventory levels (442) are highly surplus relative to current demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 22 (July 8) is firmly in the summer demand trough for women's denim. Demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) has averaged 48.7 units, with the most recent sample at 24 units. Total inventory on-hand is 418 units with 0 in-transit, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current burn rate, we have over 10 periods of supply. The priority is to avoid ordering any additional units until the surplus is cleared to minimize holding costs. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' based on consistent historical 4-period observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current trough accurately, though the OR engine's 'capped policy' will result in zero orders given the massive on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for July confirmed: Average demand for P16-P21 dropped to ~49 units, a further decline from the June baseline of ~60 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection denim) remains in a deep seasonal trough during mid-July. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22) is roughly 47.6 units, with a very low volatility (standard deviation ~15 units). The current on-hand inventory of 377 units is extremely high, covering approximately 8 periods of current demand levels, which is double the promised lead time of 4. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, it is crucial to avoid further ordering to minimize inventory carrying costs while this seasonal low persists. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to accurately reflect the observed stability of this summer baseline, which will prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Womens Everyday Collection Denim) is currently in a seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized at a low level throughout late June and July, with the most recent Period 23 showing a slight uptick to 63 units, but the average over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) remains low at 43.6 units. On-hand inventory is 314 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand over the next 5 periods (Lead Time 4 + 1 Review period), even factoring in the slight uptick. Pipeline inventory is currently empty. The primary goal remains inventory reduction to minimize holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer in case the Summer trough ends. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand parameters to capture the current stable low-demand environment, and use the default lead time (4) as actual lead times have consistently matched the promised timeframe.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists into late July: demand for P19-P23 averaged 43.6 units, maintaining a ~70% decrease from the Spring peak (~160-250 units). Inventory remains in surplus.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July (Period 25). Demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has averaged 41.2 units, indicating a stable summer trough with low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 269 units with zero in-transit. Based on the current lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~41 units/period, the required base stock is approximately 205 units. Our current on-hand inventory (269) already exceeds this coverage requirement by a significant margin. Therefore, no new orders are necessary to meet demand through the standard lead time window. I will continue to use the recent 5-period demand regime (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized summer seasonal level, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4 periods as observed lead times match this consistently.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough stabilized in July: demand for P20-P24 averaged 41.2 units, a ~75% reduction from the Spring peak and a further decline from the June baseline of ~54 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand for this 'Everyday Collection' denim SKU follows a clear seasonal pattern: a Spring peak in March/April (250-300 units/week), followed by a steady decline through May and June, reaching a Summer trough in July and early August. Demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 43.6 units with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is 224 units, which at the current burn rate of ~44 units/week, covers approximately 5 periods. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and we are just entering August (commonly the tail end of the summer trough for denim before back-to-school transitions), the existing inventory is sufficient to prevent stockouts while gradually reducing holding costs. No new orders are needed this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July/August: demand for P21-P25 averaged 43.6 units, reflecting a persistent low-demand regime (~75-80% below Spring peak).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical demand has confirmed a stable Summer 'trough' regime. For the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 43.6 units with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is 170 units, with 21 units in-transit (ordered in Period 26, expected in Period 30). With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the protection interval is 5 periods. At the current demand rate (~44 units/period), 170 units on-hand provide nearly 4 periods of coverage, while the total pipeline (170 + 21 = 191) covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand. This is slightly below the target of (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting L to 4 (promised lead time). For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 7 to capture the stable Summer baseline (Period 20-26 average). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N of 7 to reflect the current low volatility and avoid over-ordering during the seasonal dip. This configuration will likely result in a small replenishment order to reach the base stock level required for the 5-period window.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a prolonged summer demand trough, with demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) averaging 52.0 units. Current on-hand inventory (117) plus in-transit stock (73) totals 190 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are currently covered for approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods whenever arrivals occur. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization of the current low-demand regime. This keeps MU_HAT and SIGMA_HAT aligned with the current ~50 unit/week pace, preventing excessive ordering while maintaining a buffer for the observed minor fluctuations (range 41-63).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists through mid-August: demand for P23-P27 averaged 52.0 units, remaining stable but significantly lower (~80% decrease) than the Spring peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Womens Everyday Collection Denim) is currently in a stable low-demand Summer regime. Demand for the last five periods (P24-P28) has averaged 46.8 units (45, 45, 54, 53, 37). Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 80 units, with 138 units in-transit (ordered P26-P28). Since the back-end OR uses a base-stock policy targeting (L+1) periods of demand, and the current pipeline (80 on-hand + 138 in-transit = 218) already covers approximately 4.6 periods of current demand, the proposed parameters aim to maintain this coverage. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized late-summer demand mean (~47 units/period), and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to reflect current low volatility. L=4 is maintained as confirmed by history.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand shows a persistent trough since June (Summer season), with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging 44.8 units. Although there was a Spring peak in April/May, the 'Everyday Collection' denim SKU has stabilized at this lower baseline. On-hand inventory is down to 45 units, and we have a pipeline of 168 units (ordered P26-P29) expected to start arriving in Period 30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the transition into September, I will maintain the current demand forecast based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to ensure we don't over-order before any potential Autumn regime shift is confirmed. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (covering the 5-week lead time window), and sigma_hat will similarly reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed: demand for P25-P29 averaged 44.8 units, representing a stable baseline roughly 75-80% below the Spring peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering mid-September (Period 31). Historically, the Summer low-demand regime (P25-P30) averaged 40.5 units per period. However, as an 'Everyday Collection' denim product, we anticipate a potential 'Back to School' or Autumn uptick. Recent demand has been very stable (37, 35, 33), but we must be careful not to under-order as on-hand inventory has dropped to 33 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability, which averages 38.6 units. This results in a mu_hat of 193 (5 * 38.6). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to reflect the current low volatility. Total inventory (on-hand 33 + in-transit 175 = 208) is currently sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~193 for the lead time plus review period, but small replenishment orders are necessary to maintain safety stock for a potential seasonal shift.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 is currently in a stable low-demand period following the summer trough, though Period 31 saw a slight uptick to 61 units. Historically, January/February demand for this item ranged from 100-150 units, and we are approaching the fall season where a moderate recovery is expected. On-hand inventory is low (24), but there is a steady pipeline of 147 units (from orders in P28-P31) expected to arrive over the next four periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P26 confirmed in P30, P27 confirmed in P31). We will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand baseline of ~43 units, while slightly adjusting for the recent uptick to avoid stockouts as seasonality potentially shifts towards autumn. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a low-demand baseline (~40-50 units) through early September, significantly below the Spring peak. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (a 5-pocket denim product) is showing signs of a significant regime shift. After a prolonged summer trough (approx. 40-50 units/period), demand jumped to 61 units in Period 31 and 101 units in Period 32. This aligns with the transition from summer into autumn/back-to-school retail seasonality, where demand for trousers typically increases. On-hand inventory is currently depleted (0 units) because Period 32 demand (101) exceeded starting on-hand (89). Pipeline inventory is 147 units (orders from P29-P32), with the P29 order (30 units) expected to arrive in Period 33. Given the clear upward trend, I am switching to recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this growth while hedging against the high volatility of the shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: End of summer trough. Demand increased from a ~45 unit baseline to 101 units (Period 32), signaling the start of autumn seasonality for denim products.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Luna skinny denim) has entered a high-demand Autumn regime, confirmed by a massive demand spike in Period 33 (254 units), following an initial increase to 101 units in Period 32. This mirrors the seasonality observed during the Spring peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods despite arrivals. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 227 units (P30: 28, P31: 24, P32: 65, P33: 110). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the rapid escalation from ~50 to 254 units (+400%), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected high Autumn demand (forecasting a mean of ~200 units per week across the L+1 window) and set a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility seen in the shift from summer trough to autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand surged from ~50 units to 254 units in Period 33 (+400%), signaling a rapid transition into a high-demand regime similar to the Spring seasonality.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently entering the peak Autumn demand season for denim. Demand surged to 254 units in Period 33 and reached 175 units in Period 34 (despite being out-of-stock), indicating a significant regime shift from the summer trough (~45 units) to an autumn high (~200+ units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts. Promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect an expected weekly demand of 210 units (totaling 1050 for the 1+L=5 period window). This aligns with the seasonal patterns observed in Spring and the recent surge. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal regime confirmed: Demand shifted from ~50 units to an average of 214 units (P33-P34), mirroring the Spring peak intensity. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of an autumn seasonal peak for denim products. Demand surged in Period 33 (254 units) and has remained high through Period 35 (averaging 196 units over the last 3 periods). The system is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) because the previous low-demand regime parameters were insufficient for this spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (Period 36 to 40). Based on the recent three-period average (254, 175, 159), the mean demand is roughly 196 units. To prevent continued stockouts during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1000 (roughly 200 units * 5 periods). sigma_hat is set to an explicit value reflecting the high recent volatility. Large orders placed in P32-P35 (844 units in-transit) are expected to arrive starting next period, which will help resolve the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand shifted from ~50 units to an average of 196 units (P33-P35). Current inventory is 0 due to the rapid demand transition.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Womens Everyday denim) is currently in its Autumn seasonal peak, which started around Period 33. Recent demand (P33-P36) has been significantly higher (254, 175, 159, 124) than the summer baseline (~45). Although demand shows a slight tapering from the initial spike of 254, it remains elevated (average of last 4 periods is 178). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the rapid seasonal transition, but a large pipeline (1032 units) is in transit, with the Period 33 order (110 units) expected to arrive in the current period resolution (Period 37). To ensure we meet this high-demand regime while accounting for the recent tapering, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P33-P36) to capture the Autumn peak average (178 units) across the lead time of 4. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 36 conclude'. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility during this seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand shifted from ~50 units to an average of 178 units (P33-P36). Peak volatility is significantly higher than summer baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Luna skinny denim) is currently in an autumn high-demand regime, which started around Period 33. Demand spiked to 254 units and has since averaged 142.4 units over the last five periods (P33-P37: 254, 175, 159, 124, 100). While there is a downward trend since the initial peak, demand remains significantly higher than the summer trough (~45 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (10 units), but there is a large pipeline (922 units) scheduled to arrive over the next four periods (P34 order: 311, P35: 358, P36: 253, P37: 0). The OR backend must bridge the demand until these large orders arrive. I will set L to 4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering the autumn regime) to capture the current mean of ~142 units per period, adjusted for lead time. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal mean demand for P33-P37 stabilized at 142.4 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline but showing a gradual decline after the late-September peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's denim) is currently in an Autumn high-demand regime, which started around Period 33. The mean demand for this regime (P33-P38) is 166.5 units. While there was a significant peak of 254 units in P33, the last few periods show a stabilization between 100-187 units. For Period 39, the on-hand inventory is 134 units and the in-transit pipeline is 611 units (orders from P35, P36). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a mu_hat based on the recent Autumn regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this sustained high-demand state compared to the summer trough, while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed during seasonal transitions. I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal behavior efficiently.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed (P33-P38): Mean demand increased to 166.5 units from a summer baseline of ~45 units (+270%). Demand is stabilizing but remains volatile.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn high-demand regime, with demand having spiked significantly starting Period 33. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 109 units, following a peak of 254 units and a subsequent stabilization. Over the last 7 periods (P33-P39), mean demand is 158.3 units. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and its associated volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 37, 38, and 39. On-hand inventory is 383 units with 442 in-transit. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At a mean of ~158, total needs are ~790 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 825, which is sufficient, but maintaining the order parameters using recent high-demand statistics allows the OR backend to replenish appropriately if demand surges again before the winter period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the Autumn seasonal regime. Demand for the most recent three periods (P38-P40) has averaged 142.7 units (187, 109, 132), which is remarkably consistent with the Carry-over Insight for Period 38 (142.4 units). While significantly higher than the summer trough, the explosive growth seen in P33 (254 units) has stabilized. On-hand inventory is currently high at 504 units, with 257 units in-transit (orders from P39 and P40). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the current weekly mean of ~143 units, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce or stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (P33-P40) to capture the full Autumn regime mean, which is 156.25 units, and use the same N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility compared to summer.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal regime stabilized: Demand for P38-P40 averaged 142.7 units, confirming a shift from the peak levels (>200) to a steady high-demand baseline through November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/25. We are in the late Autumn/early Winter period for women's denim. Historical demand evidence shows the Autumn seasonal peak (P33-P35) has subsided into a stable high-demand baseline. Over the last four periods (P38-P41), demand has been 187, 109, 132, and 122 units, averaging 137.5 units. This is consistent with the 'Autumn seasonal regime stabilized' insight from Period 41. We expect this level of demand to continue through late November and December. Inventory is currently healthy with 382 on hand and 367 in transit (orders from P39, P40, P41). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stable post-peak baseline (avg ~137.5 * 5 periods = 687.5). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=4 to reflect the current moderate volatility. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter regime stabilized: Demand P38-P41 averaged 137.5 units, representing a stable baseline following the September/October seasonal peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 1007 units, likely due to a major calendar event like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, which significantly impacts the women's denim category. This spike exhausted all on-hand inventory. While demand for the previous four weeks (P38-P41) averaged 137.5 units, this extreme outlier must be addressed carefully. I expect demand to return to a more stable high-demand baseline for the lead-time horizon (L+1 = 5 periods), but I must account for the high volatility introduced by this spike to prevent further stockouts. The current in-transit inventory is 371 units (P39-P42 orders). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P38-P42) to include the spike while capturing the recent baseline, utilizing 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect this new variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 42 (1007 units), corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This represents a 7x increase over the previous 4-week mean of 137.5. Short-term volatility has increased significantly.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December period (P45, Dec 16), following the significant demand surges of Black Friday (P42: 1007 units) and Cyber Monday/Early Dec (P43: 771 units). The most recent demand (P44: 88 units) indicates that the extreme peak has subsided, though we should expect elevated holiday demand to continue through late December. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a large pipeline of 1067 units. This pipeline includes orders from P41 (110 units), P42 (4 units), and P43 (953 units). Given the stable lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P41 order to arrive this period (P45) and the massive P43 order to arrive in P47. Since we are at P45 of 47, we are near the end of the simulation. The backend's base-stock calculation will take the pipeline into account. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime of the last month without letting the single P42 spike (1007) completely distort the forecast, while using explicit sigma to handle the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P42-P43): Demand surged to 1007 and 771 units, roughly 6-7x the previous baseline, before dropping to 88 units in P44. Pipeline inventory is heavily loaded to meet this volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are past the major holiday demand spikes (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) and the immediate pre-Christmas surge. Demand in Period 44-45 has plummeted to 88 and 77 units respectively, signaling the end of the peak holiday regime and a transition into a post-holiday/Winter baseline. On-hand inventory is low (33), but the pipeline is heavily loaded with 1,672 units (including the massive 953-unit order from P43 and 719-unit order from P45). With a lead time of 4 periods, these will begin arriving from Period 47 onwards. Since demand has significantly cooled, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P43-P45) to capture this downward trend (averaging ~312, primarily due to the residual P43 spike) while recognizing that true current demand is likely closer to 80 units. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed over the last 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P43) has concluded; demand in P44-P45 averaged 82.5 units, signaling a return to a lower baseline (~80-100 units) for the late December/January period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand holiday peak (Period 42-43) has definitively ended. Demand for the last three periods (P44-P46) has stabilized at an average of 72.3 units (88, 77, 52), signaling a transition to a post-holiday trough. Despite on-hand inventory being 0, the pipeline is extremely heavy with 2357 units in-transit (orders from P43, P45, and P46 are looming). Specifically, the P43 order of 953 units is due to arrive next period (P47), which will far exceed current demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs from this massive pipeline, I am setting the forcast \u03bc\u0302 and volatility \u03c3\u0302 based on the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the new lower baseline (~72 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to likely place a zero order, allowing the system to bleed off the incoming inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand trough confirmed: Demand for P44-P46 averaged 72.3 units, a significant drop from the 137-unit late-autumn baseline and the 800+ unit holiday peak.
