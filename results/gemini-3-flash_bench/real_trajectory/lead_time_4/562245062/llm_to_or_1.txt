Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 562245062 is a pair of women's everyday skinny jeans. Historical demand data shows a clear upward trend (59, 78, 96, 123, 144) over the last 5 weeks, suggesting a demand regime change or seasonality shift. The promised lead time is 4. Given the strong trend, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (mean of 96, 123, 144 = 121). The OR backend will scale this by (1+L) = 5, resulting in a forecast of 605. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the higher volatility associated with this growth phase. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (offered lead time = 4) until we observe actual arrivals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', a staple women's 5-pocket jean. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144, and most recently 107 (though Period 1 sales were limited by 0 on-hand inventory, demand was recorded). The promised lead time is 4. An order of 161 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. Since actual lead time observations aren't possible until Period 5 or 6 (given L=4), I will use the promised lead time. For demand, the last 4 weeks (including the Period 1 demand of 107) show a mean of ~117.5. To be conservative and responsive to the recent growth while acknowledging the slight dip in P1, I will use recent_N with N=4 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend project demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) while accounting for the recent trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product (Women's 5-pocket jeans) shows a clear upward demand trend in the pre-game historical samples (59 to 144 units). However, we are currently experiencing a stockout because the first order (placed in Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 5. The OR engine parameters must account for both the rising demand trend and the lead time. Given the samples [59, 78, 96, 123, 144, 107, 75], the most recent periods show a slight stabilization/dip from the peak but the overall level is significantly higher than the start. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no orders have arrived yet (as expected per L=4), I will use 'default' for lead time L.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Historical demand data shows 5 samples (59, 78, 96, 123, 144) and recent performance in Periods 1-3 shows demand of 107, 75, and 52 respectively. The promethean lead time is 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 and be visible in Period 6's decision phase. Currently, all units are in-transit (161+152+153 = 466) and on-hand is 0, which is expected given the lead time. Demand appears to be softening compared to the initial high-growth phase seen in the historical samples, dropping from 144 (last historical) to 52 (P3). I will use a shorter window (N=5) to capture the recent trend of declining demand while maintaining enough coverage for the 4-period lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this current period) and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales because arrivals haven't started yet. Demand history (samples: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144 followed by game history: 107, 75, 52, 66) shows a peak in late January (144) followed by a cooling-off period in February/early March. The mean of the most recent 4 periods is 75 units/period. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the post-peak demand level, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat as there is not yet enough conclusive evidence to deviate from the promised lead time or total historical volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Looking at the history, the Period 1 order (161 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since L=4, the orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 (summing to 340 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand has shown high initial values (P1: 107) followed by a stabilization/dip (P2-P5 range: 52-75). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 71. In-transit inventory (340) plus on-hand (106) equals 446 units, which covers approximately 6.2 periods of the current average demand. Since (L+1) = 5, we are currently slightly over-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend since the start of the simulation, and 'default' for lead time as the promised lead time of 4 is currently holding true.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) shows a stabilized demand pattern following an initial high-demand phase in early 2019. The last three periods (P4-P6) show demand of 66, 55, and 58, which is significantly lower than the samples from January/early February. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Current on-hand is 200, with 188 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). Since profitability and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%. I am setting L=4, mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P2-P6 mean ~61) to capture the recent stabilized demand, and sigma_hat based on those same samples to account for current volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a downward trend from the initial samples (Jan/Feb highs of 78-144) to more stable levels in the last 7 periods (avg ~67). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). We currently have 298 units on-hand and 35 in-transit (due next period). Looking at recent demand (last 7 periods: 107, 75, 52, 66, 55, 58, 55), the average is approx 67. Lead time L=4 means we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory (298+35=333) roughly covers 5 periods at the current mean (333 / 67 \u2248 4.97). I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand to reflect the stabilization after the Jan/Feb peak, ensuring the OR backend targets this lower, more stable regime to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding cost are equal (1:1), favoring a lean inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Initial Jan/Feb demand (avg ~100) has stabilized to a lower mean (avg ~67) over the last 7 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/08). Analyzing the historical demand data: the initial seed samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~100 units/week. Since self-resolving in the game (Period 1 onwards), the demand has consistently dropped to a lower regime. The demand over the last 8 periods (P1 to P8) has been [107, 75, 52, 66, 55, 58, 55, 64], averaging approximately 66.5 units. The Carry-over Insight from Period 8 correctly identified this shift. Lead times are stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 269 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (approximately 4 weeks of supply). With L=4, the base stock system targets coverage for (L+1) = 5 periods. 269 On-hand + 2 In-transit (271 total) already covers roughly 4.1 periods of demand at the current rate (~66/week). Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the service level target z* is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), implying we should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime accurately, preventing further overstocking while holding costs are high.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), the demand for the SKU 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) has stabilized following an initial peak in late January/early February. Demand over the last five periods (P5-P9) has been consistently lower: 55, 58, 55, 64, 52, averaging approximately 56.8 units per week. The actual lead time has been verified as 4 periods across four distinct shipments (P1 through P4 arrivals). Currently, on-hand (217) and in-transit (64) inventory totals 281 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average, this requirement is ~284 units. Since on-hand inventory is high relative to the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the stable regime since Period 5) to avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent volatility. Lead time L is set to default as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical arrival data (P5 through P8) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P8, we have observed a lower demand regime for this women's denim product, with the last 6 periods showing a mean demand of 54.8 (P5-P10: 55, 58, 55, 64, 52, 43). This is significantly lower than the initial Jan/Feb samples (avg ~100). For Period 11, I will continue using N=6 for my demand forecast to capture this stabilized regime. Current inventory (174 on-hand + 67 in-transit = 241) is more than sufficient to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average (54.8 * 5 = 274), but we must maintain stock to handle the 50% service level target (implied by Profit $1 / Holding $1). Setting 'recent_N' to 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine uses the most relevant demand profile.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), we are managing SKU 562245062 (Luna skinny RW jeans). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (Periods 5-8) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand history shows a clear regime shift: early samples (Jan/Feb) were high (~100), but since Period 2, weekly demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), the average demand is 53.4. Over the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11), the average is 50.4, with a decreasing trend (64 to 38). Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With on-hand inventory at 136 and 99 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11), our pipeline is 235 units. Using a 5-period average (~50), the expected demand over (L+1) is ~250. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the stabilized regime while smoothing recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use N=9. L will remain 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 3-11 is ~53 units, significantly lower than the initial ~100 units/week earlier in the year.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' skinny jean. Historical demand shows a downward trend: after an initial average of ~100 in Jan/Feb, the average demand from Period 3 to Period 11 dropped to ~53, and the most recent demand in Period 12 was 27. There appears to be a persistent demand regime shift toward lower volume. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12). Current inventory status is 111 units on-hand and 131 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given that Holding Cost ($1.0) is equal to Profit ($1.0), the backend logic uses a 50% service level target (q = 0.5), which seeks to minimize total cost. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime since Period 3, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the high early-year volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 3-12 (last 10 periods) has dropped to ~50 units/period, down from ~100 in early Jan/Feb.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a women's skinny jean. Historical demand shows a clear downward shift from the start of the year (mean ~111 in late Jan/early Feb) to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 11 periods (Periods 3-13), the average demand is 52.4 units. The the most recent 5 periods (Periods 9-13) show an average of 45.8 units, suggesting a continued slight decline or stabilization around 45-50. Lead times have been consistent at the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P12, and P13). In-transit inventory (82 units) consists of orders from P10 (3), P11 (32), P12 (34), and P13 (13), which are expected to arrive in P14, P15, P16, and P17 respectively. On-hand inventory is 114 units. Total pipeline coverage (114+82 = 196) effectively covers ~4 weeks of demand at current rates (~50/week). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (spanning the post-shift regime) to reflect this stabilized demand, while keeping default L and sigma calculation to respond to the volatility observed across these periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). Historical demand shows a significant drop from the initial January/February period (~100 units/week) to a stabilized lower mean. Over the last 12 periods (P3-P14), the mean demand is approximately 53 units. More specifically, the last 4 periods (P11-P14) have averaged 46.75 units, although P13 and P14 saw a slight uptick to ~61 units. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P12, P13, and P14). On-hand inventory is 54 and In-transit is 142. Given the promised lead time L=4, the OR engine will target coverage for L+1=5 periods. A mean (mu_hat) based on the last 12 periods (~53 units/period) captures the lower demand regime while allowing for the recent slight increase. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the initial high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand from Period 3-14 is approx 53 units/period, with recent 2 periods showing a slight increase to 60 units/period. Lead time consistently aligns with promised 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (2019/5/27). Demand for the last 3 periods (P13-P15) has shown an upward trend (59, 63, 74) compared to the previous stabilization at ~50. This aligns with late-May seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Collection' 5-pocket jeans. I will use a recent demand window to capture this slight increase. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). Pipeline inventory is 178 units, covering expected demand for the prochain (L+1) periods (approx 5 * 65 = 325 units), although on-hand is low (12). The OR backend uses Profit=1, Holding=1 which results in a 0.50 service level (z=0), aiming to minimize inventory. Given the upward demand trend, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent volatility and mean demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~65 (+30%) over the last 3 periods, likely due to spring/summer seasonality for womens denim.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 shows 0 on-hand inventory with 215 units in-transit. In Period 16, demand (48) exceeded available inventory (46), resulting in 2 units of lost sales. The carry-over insight from Period 16 accurately identified a demand shift (approx. +30% increase) starting around Period 13 as we transitioned into the summer season for 'Womens Everyday' denim. Lead times remain consistent at the promised 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is depleted but the pipeline is significant, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect the current higher demand level (mean ~61 over Periods 13-16) while accounting for the lead time (L=4). Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat captures this seasonal upturn. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to handle the increased volatility seen in the May/June window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' is currently experiencing stockouts (0 units on hand at start of Period 18) due to an increase in demand volatility and slightly higher demand averages around late spring/early summer. The most recent demand samples show high variance: 59, 63, 74, 48, 34 (avg ~56). The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identified a shift from a low of ~50 to ~65 (+30%), though Period 17 saw a dip to 34. Since we have been stocking out for two consecutive periods (sold 46/48 in P16, sold 13/34 in P17), we need to ensure mu_hat captures this recent regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to focus on the current shopping season (May/June). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). My parameters aim to replenish inventory quickly to meet the ~56-65 units/period demand and prevent further lost sales given the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13 confirmed: while Period 17 saw a lower demand of 34, the average of the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17) is 55.6, compared to the previously stabilized mean of 50. High volatility observed in recent weeks.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the item (Womens Everyday denim) is showing high demand volatility during the transition to summer. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on all historical evidence (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 all show arrivals at exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is low (24 units) following a period of stockouts (Periods 16 and 17). Pipeline inventory is high (218 units), representing the orders from Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18. Demand over the last 6 periods (P13-P18) has averaged 52.8 units (59, 63, 74, 48, 34, 39). While the average of the last 3 periods is slightly lower (40.3), the 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim category remains sensitive to late-spring/early-summer shopping patterns. Given the 1.0/1.0 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which started around Period 13, balancing the recent spikes with the latest three lower observations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24). Demand for 'Luna skinny jeans' has shown significant volatility recently. After an apparent upward shift starting in Period 13 (averaging ~65), the last three periods (17, 18, 19) have recorded lower demand (34, 39, 25). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 13-19) is approximately 49 units, which aligns closely with the previously established stable regime of ~50. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the recent downward trend, I am using a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Setting N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current volatility and the mean of the most recent cycle. Lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods since the start of the game (observed in all 15 arrivals), so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand for the Luna skinny jeans has significantly dropped over the last two periods (P19: 25, P20: 10), marking a potential end to the spring uptick previously observed. The average demand of the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is approximately 39 units. The current on-hand inventory is 128 units, and in-transit inventory is 107 units. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 235 units. Applying a (L+1) horizon with L=4, the current position covers roughly 6 periods of demand at the recent average. Given that the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At this service level, the inventory position is already quite high for the current low-demand trend. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent mean and higher historical volatility, which will allow the OR backend to scale back ordering and avoid excessive holding costs while the demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand drop observed starting Period 19: Average demand decreased from ~55 to ~17 (-69%) over the last 2 periods, suggesting a mid-summer cooling for this denim SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245062' (Womens denim) is entering a low-demand regime for July. Demand has dropped significantly: 25, 10, and 9 units over the last three periods. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~14.7 units, a stark contrast to the spring average of ~55. With 198 units on-hand and 28 units in-transit (ordered Periods 19 and 20), our current inventory position covers over 15 weeks of recent demand. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) allows the OR engine to adapt to this summer cooling and avoid over-ordering, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), making overstocking very expensive.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop confirmed starting Period 19: Average transitioned from ~55 to ~14.7 over the last 3 periods (-73%), reflecting mid-summer seasonality for this denim SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are managing 'Luna skinny RW' denim trousers. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a significant demand regime shift that began around Period 19 (mid-June). The average demand has dropped from ~55 units/period to approximately 17.5 units/period over the last 4 periods (P19: 25, P20: 10, P21: 9, P22: 26). This is characteristic of a mid-summer slump for full-length heavy denim as temperatures rise. Currently, on-hand inventory (172) plus in-transit stock (28, ordered in P19 and P20) totals 200 units. Given the new low-demand regime (~17.5/week), our current total inventory is sufficient to cover over 11 weeks of demand, which far exceeds the L+1 (5-week) safety window. No new orders are needed. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the summer cooling effect, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for denim confirmed (Periods 19-22): Mean demand dropped to 17.5 units/period, down from previous spring highs of ~60. Volatility has also decreased during this low-sales phase.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-summer demand phase for this denim SKU. After a significant drop in late June/early July (Periods 20-21), demand has slightly rebounded in the last two periods (26 and 35 units). The average demand for the current 'low' regime (Periods 19-23) is approximately 21 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (Periods 19-23), the mean is 21 with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. Inventory levels are high (On-hand: 160), which far exceeds any immediate demand requirements given a 4-period lead time. No order was placed in Period 18, and orders from Periods 20 and 21 were very small or zero, leading to the current low 'In-transit' of 5 units (from Period 20, expected shortly). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the mean of the distribution. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture this stabilized low demand while allowing for the slight recent uptick, and sigma_hat will be calculated from the same recent window to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the spring season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW denim' is in a mid-summer demand regime (late July). Historical data from the last 6 periods (Periods 19-24) shows demand has averaged approximately 20.3 units per period (25, 10, 9, 26, 35, 17), with significant volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 148 units with no units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a service level target (profit and holding cost are both $1.0, so critical ratio is 0.5), we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At current demand levels, 148 units of stock covers ~7 weeks of demand, which is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current low-demand summer phase while accounting for the recent higher variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Demand for these washed, superstretch denim trousers has fluctuated significantly through the year. After a mid-summer slump in June and July (Periods 19-22 average demand ~14.7), demand has shown signs of recovery over the last three periods (P23-P25: 35, 17, 41), averaging approximately 31 units per week. This aligns with the beginning of the 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Fall' season, where demand for trousers and denim typically begins to climb after summer. Current on-hand inventory is 107 units with nothing in-transit. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I am setting L to default (4) and targeting a recent demand regime of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the emerging recovery while acknowledging the volatility. This balances the risk of overstocking high-holding-cost items against the need to meet increasing autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery starting Period 23: Average demand increased from ~15 to over 30 units/period as the season transitions from mid-summer into early August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Luna skinny RW denim) is entering the late summer/early fall transition (mid-August). Historical demand data suggests a clear recovery from the mid-summer low (~15-17 units) seen in periods 19-22. Over the last four periods (23-26), demand has risen: 35, 17, 41, 58, averaging approximately 37.8 units per period. The most recent demand (58) confirms a move back toward typical spring/autumn levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this recovery trend while remaining cautious of potential volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent increase in variability during this transition phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed starting Period 23: Mean demand for the transition into August (P23-P26) has increased to ~38 units/period, up from the mid-summer trough of ~15.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Denim) is experiencing a strong seasonal recovery as it transitions into late August (likely a 'Back to School' or early Fall trend). Demand has surged from a mid-summer trough (avg ~15-18) to 58 and 91 units in the last two periods. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline contains 108 units (42 from P26 and 66 from P27), but these will not arrive until P30 and P31 respectively. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp demand increase (avg of last 3 periods is ~63), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this upward trajectory and set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order to cover the current stockout and expected high demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand recovery into late August: Demand has increased from ~15 units/period in July to an average of ~63 units/period over the last 3 periods (P25-P27), peaking at 91 units in P27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand recovery phase (late August/Early September) for these 5-pocket jeans. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) was 58, 91, and 87, averaging approximately 78.7 units. This significantly exceeds the mid-summer low of ~15-18 units and the previous spring average of ~50-60 units. The upcoming period (P29, Date 2019/8/26) precedes the Labor Day weekend in the US, which typically sees a spike in back-to-school and apparel shopping. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 214 units in transit (ordered in P26, P27, and P28). With a lead time of 4 periods, these will arrive in P30, P31, and P32 respectively. This means we must survive P29 with 0 stock unless an arrival occurs (though none are scheduled based on the order history). To capture the current upward trend and account for the seasonal transition into autumn, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to isolate the current high-demand regime (avg ~79, forecasting ~394 for the L+1 window). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the high volatility (std ~18) observed during this recovery.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Late August demand surge confirmed: Demand for P26-P28 (avg 78.7) is ~100% higher than the early August transition (avg 38) and substantially higher than the July trough (~15).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (denim) has shifted from a mid-summer low (~15 units) to a strong late-August/Back-to-School surge, averaging 78.7 units over P26-P28. In P29, demand remained high at 72. We are currently stocked out on-hand (0 units) with 323 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the first major replenishment (ordered P26) to arrive in Period 30, which will be visible in P31. Since the product is 'Womens Everyday' denim, high demand is expected to persist through September. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P26-P29) to capture this specific high-demand regime (average ~77). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility of this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime: Early September (P29) continues the surge trend observed in late August, with demand holding above 70 units/period after a peak of 91 in P27.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained 'Back-to-School/Autumn' demand surge that began around Period 26 (August). Demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) has averaged 79.4 units, a significant increase from the mid-summer low of ~15 units. Despite high demand, the system has been stock-constrained, resulting in lost sales (on-hand 0 at start of Period 31). Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). To align the OR backend with this higher demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the period since the August recovery began). This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), helping to recover from the current stock-out and capture the ongoing high demand into September.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P26 to P30 (avg 79.4 units/period) confirmed as the seasonal peak for autumn; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained peak demand period (late August to mid-September) likely driven by back-to-school and autumn seasonal shifts for denim. The last 6 periods (P26-P31) show a significantly higher demand regime, with an average of 83 units/period (58, 91, 87, 72, 89, 101) compared to the July low of ~15. We are currently facing stockouts due to this rapid surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To maintain service levels and account for the current high-demand regime while stock is arriving, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the average of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the autumn peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime confirmed (P26-P31): Mean demand has increased to 83 units/period, a significant shift from the summer trough. High demand is sustained into mid-September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, confirmed from Period 26 onwards (Autumn/Back-to-school peak). Mean demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 85.5 units/period, with the last two periods hitting 101 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this current high-demand mean and variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 units on-hand and high demand expected, the OR backend needs these parameters to accurately calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, especially given the current stockout risks visible in the history (P30, P31).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime (P26-P32) shows a stable high-demand mean of ~85.5 units/period, significantly higher than previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (washed superstretch denim) has reached a new autumn peak. In Period 33, demand jumped significantly to 149 units, representing a 47% increase over the previous 7-period average (~101 units). This aligns with late September/early October seasonality for everyday denim staples. Despite arrivals of 109 units, high demand left on-hand inventory at 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend (101, 101, 149 in the last 3 weeks), I am using N=3 for mu_hat to capture this surge, setting it to 117 units per period (multiplied by L+1). This ensures the base stock reflects the accelerating autumn demand while accounting for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand surge intensified at Period 33: Demand jumped to 149 units, a 47% increase over the P26-P32 average (approx 101). Strong seasonal momentum for denim confirmed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245062' (Womens Denim) is currently in a strong autumn peak demand regime. Demand since Period 27 has consistently stayed above 70 units, with a notable surge starting at Period 33 (149 units) and continuing into Period 34 (131 units). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 114 units, compared to the P26-P32 average of ~85 units. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) due to demand exceeding recent arrivals, though 411 units are in-transit. To capture this high-demand momentum and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~114 units/period, and adjusting sigma_hat using the same window to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand intensified significantly starting Period 33: Average demand for P33-P34 is 140 units, a ~65% increase over the previous high-demand regime (P26-P32) mean of ~85 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn peak for this denim SKU. Average demand for the last three periods (P33-P35) is 131.6 units, which is a significant increase from the previous high-demand regime of ~85 units. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 513 units. To capture this shift and ensure sufficient base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the 130+ units/period trend. Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime intensified further: Average demand reached ~132 units/period over P33-P35, confirming a sustained 55% increase over the previous regime (P26-P32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' is currently in its autumn peak demand regime. Demand has intensified significantly starting around Period 33, with an average of approximately 131 units over the last four periods (P33: 149, P34: 131, P35: 115, P36: 130). This is a sustained +50% increase over the late-August/early-September regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this intensified autumn peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. The on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand outpacing recent arrivals, but there is a significant pipeline (575 units) in transit intended to cover this peak. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will allow the OR backend to account for the current high volatility in sales during this peak season, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to minimize lost sales while inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand intensification confirmed at Period 33: Mean demand for P33-P36 is ~131 units/period, compared to the P26-P32 average of ~85 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny' denim continues its strong autumn peak. Over the recent regime starting at Period 33, demand has been consistently high, with a mean of approximately 131.4 units/period (P33-P37: 149, 131, 115, 130, 132). Current inventory status shows 0 on-hand and 545 units in-transit, which includes orders from Period 34 (161), Period 35 (156), Period 36 (146), and Period 37 (82). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the fact that we are currently stock-out despite incoming deliveries, I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on this recent high-demand regime (N=5) to ensure the OR backend captures the sustained surge and protects against stockouts during this peak seasonal phase. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's inventory cap and safety stock logic require accurate variance estimates to manage this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime (P33-P37) shows a stable high-demand mean of 131.4 units/period, roughly 55% higher than the previous transition period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/10/28 was 113, following an average of 131.4 over the previous five periods (P33-P37). We are currently in the mid-autumn retail season, where demand for 'Everyday Collection' denim remains high and relatively stable. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. With On-hand inventory at 48 and pipeline inventory (In-transit) at 496, we need to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current high-demand regime. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P33-P38) is approximately 128.5 units. Choosing N=6 for recent_N captures this specific high-demand phase while account for current stock-outs in history.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P33-P38) mean confirmed at ~128 units/period, showing a slight stabilization from the initial peak of 149 in P33.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (washed superstretch denim) is entering mid-November. Historically, we saw a massive autumn peak starting Period 33 (late September) with demand averaging ~131 units/period. However, the last two periods (P38-P39) have shown a cooling trend, with demand dropping from 132 to 113, and then to 80 units. This suggests the peak-autumn 'back-to-school' and 'early fall' surge has passed its crest. Analysis of the recent regime (P33-P39) shows a mean of 121.4, but the most recent 3 periods average 108.3. Given the date (Nov 11) and the downward trend in the last week, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) to capture the autumn regime while allowing the recent lower values to pull the average down slightly to prevent excessive overstocking. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history, so I continue with the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed from Period 38: After the autumn peak (avg ~131), demand has declined to 113 (P38) and 80 (P39), signaling the transition out of the high-fall denim season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), moving further away from the autumn demand peak for denim. The demand history shows a clear deceleration: from an autumn peak average of ~131 units (P33-P37) down to 113 (P38), 80 (P39), and now 68 (P40). This confirms a transition into a lower-demand seasonal regime. With 202 units on-hand and 338 units in-transit (total 540), and demand currently at 68, the inventory position is quite high for the current sales velocity. To avoid excessive holding costs as the season cools further, I will capture the recent deceleration by setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 (averaging the last three periods: 80, 68, and 113/2=90ish) to lower the base stock level. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed starting Period 38: Mean demand has dropped from the autumn peak of 131 units/period to an average of ~87 units/period over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), marking the end of the high-fall denim season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW denim' is experiencing a significant post-peak deceleration as of late November (Period 41). Demand has transitioned from an autumn peak of ~131 units/period down to an average of ~73 units over the last four periods (P38-P41: 113, 80, 68, 70). The carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (214 units) with an additional 256 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, and P40), which is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime of ~70 units across the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, I am choosing the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this deceleration. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked unexpectedly to 327 units, which is a massive outlier compared to the recent deceleration trend (avg ~87 units/period for P38-P40). This is almost certainly due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Nov 29, 2019, falls within this window). This spike completely cleared the 326 units of on-hand inventory. History shows that after such promotional surges, demand typically returns to previous regime levels or continues its seasonal decline. I will treat P42 as a one-time outlier rather than a permanent regime shift. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (P38-P42) which includes the surge and the deceleration, resulting in a slightly elevated but cautious mean to account for remaining holiday tail-winds. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 144 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40), we need to ensure the pipeline covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand surged to 327 units (approx +400% vs recent avg), exhausting all on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU experienced the typical post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand surge (133 units), following the massive 327-unit peak in Period 42. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). While we ordered 314 units last period to recover, those will not arrive until Period 48. There are 360 units currently in-transit (98 units from P39 arrived in P43; 46 units from P40, 0 from P41, 0 from P42, and 314 from P43 remain). Specifically, 46 units from P40 are expected in the current Period 44 resolution phase, but will only be visible in P45's start. Demand is now transitioning into the mid-December holiday season. Given the recent extreme volatility (P42: 327, P43: 133) following the seasonal deceleration (avg ~70), I will use an EWMA with a gamma of 0.3 for mu_hat. This allows the model to react to the recent high-demand spikes while acknowledging the historical mean. Sigma_hat is set to 20 periods to capture the high volatility of the holiday season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand stabilization: Demand remained elevated at 133 units in P43 after the P42 peak of 327, indicating a significant but shorter-lived holiday surge compared to the autumn peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 45 (2019/12/16). Recent history shows a massive demand spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) of 327 units, followed by a post-holiday demand of 133 in P43 and a significant drop to 54 in P44. This suggests we are entering the post-holiday/pre-Christmas wind-down. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), orders placed now (P45) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive until Period 49, which is past the game's end. Therefore, placing further orders is unnecessary as they will only contribute to ending inventory costs without the possibility of being sold. We must rely on 'In-transit' inventory that was ordered in Periods 41-44 to cover the remaining demand. Total in-transit is 585 units (likely shipments from P43 and P44 arriving in P47 and beyond). For the OR backend, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent high-volatility holiday period, but the policy will effectively zero out any new orders due to the short time horizon remaining.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped from 133 (P43) to 54 (P44) following the Black Friday peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), heading into the final period of the game (Period 47). Current on-hand is 0. The major demand spikes (Autumn peak and Black Friday) have passed. Recent demand (P44: 54, P45: 64) suggests a stabilization around 60 units/period for late December. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Orders placed today (P46) will arrive in Period 50, which is beyond the game horizon (P47). However, the in-transit pipeline is very large (857 units), with significant orders placed in P43 (314), P44 (271), and P45 (272). The order from P41 was 0, and the order from P42 was 0. The order from P41 would have arrived now (P46), but it was 0. The order from P42 (also 0) will arrive next period (P47). Therefore, we expect 0 arrivals for the remaining game periods. With 0 on-hand and 0 expected arrivals, we cannot satisfy any more demand. Since orders placed now won't arrive in time to affect the score, and to minimize any potential (though unlikely) holding cost calculated at the final state, I will set parameters to target a low base stock based on the recent post-holiday average of ~60 units. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the Black Friday surge down to the current ~60 unit level.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand has settled to an average of ~60 units/period (P44-P45) following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). The historical context shows: 1) A massive Black Friday spike (P42, 327 units), 2) Post-holiday stabilization (P44-P46, avg ~55 units). Although on-hand inventory is 0, there are 857 units in-transit, ordered following the Black Friday stockout. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The arrivals for the large orders from P43 (314 units) are expected to land in P47 (visible in P48), and P44 (271 units) in P48 (visible in P49). Currently, the 'In-transit' quantity (857) far exceeds the base stock needed for a regime of ~55-65 units/period. The OR backend will automatically limit new orders because pipeline inventory is high. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent post-holiday average (~60 units/period) using the last 3 periods (P44-P46) to avoid over-ordering during the January demand cooling. Sigma remains based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (starting P44): Demand has stabilized at ~55-65 units/period following the Black Friday peak/holiday surge.
