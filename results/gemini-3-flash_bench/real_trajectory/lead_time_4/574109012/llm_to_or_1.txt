Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater from the H&M Divided collection. Historical demand samples from January showing a significant peak (198 units) on Jan 21 followed by a stabilization around 60-70 units in early February. Given the product category (knitwear/sweaters) and the date (mid-February), we are likely exiting the peak winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, though demand remains steady. On-hand and in-transit inventory are currently 0. The promised lead time is 4. I will use the recent demand trend (3 samples: Jan 28, Feb 4, and the average including Jan 21) to project mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the post-peak Jan average (~108), providing a safer buffer than the long-term average while we establish the current regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Target SKU is a fitted rib-knit sweater. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan-Feb) shows a significant spike on Jan 21 (198 units) followed by stabilization around 50-68 units. Period 1 demand was 53. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order of 237 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and not expected until Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1. Since demand has been relatively stable around 50-60 recently (N=3), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (Jan 28, Feb 04, Feb 11) to capture the current post-spike baseline. sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at 4 periods as no actual arrival data is yet available to contradict the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a fine rib knit fitted top (sweater category). Looking at historical data: 2019-01-07 (15), 01-14 (50), 01-21 (198), 01-28 (60), 02-04 (68). In game play: P1 demand was 53, P2 was 80. The peak in January (198) appears to be an outlier or a specific promotion. The recent demand (last 4 weeks: 60, 68, 53, 80) averages ~65 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from P1 (237) and P2 (65) are in-transit (total 302). Since L=4, the P1 order is expected to arrive at the end of P5 (visible P6). Current on-hand is 0, meaning we have lost sales in P1 and P2. I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand regime (last 4 points + current trend) to avoid over-ordering based on the Jan outlier. I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current mean of ~65. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a fine-knit sweater, likely entering its end-of-winter/early-spring phase. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 15, 50, 198, 60, 68) and game history demand (53, 80, 88) show moderate volatility with an upward trend in game play compared to the earliest samples. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 (total 327 units) are still in transit; the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (appearing in P6 start). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all sales so far (80+88+53 = 221 units), we need to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the mean of the last 3 game periods (approx 73.67) to project demand. mu_hat = 5 * 73.67 \u2248 368. Since we have 327 in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. We use 'default' for L (4) and sigma_hat until actual lead time data arrives.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 5 (2019/3/11). We are managing a fitted knit top (Rachel LS TVP). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Our history shows orders placed in Period 1 (237 units), Period 2 (65), Period 3 (25), and Period 4 (42) are all currently in-transit (Total = 369). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive DURING Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's start. Demand over the last 5 weeks (including pre-game samples) has been 15, 50, 198 (spike), 60, 68, followed by in-game demand of 53, 80, 88, 75. The mean demand since the spike is approximately 74 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we have missed sales for 4 periods. The pipeline (369 units) should cover demand for several periods once arrivals start. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the stable demand regime seen since the game started (averaging ~74/week), setting mu_hat = (1+4)*74 = 370. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Rachel LS TVP (Fitted rib-knit sweater). Demand has stabilized since the initial spike, with the last 4 periods showing values of 80, 88, 75, and 67 (mean \u2248 77). The Period 1 order (237 units) arrived in Period 5 exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 170 units, which is healthy relative to recent weekly demand. Looking ahead, we are in mid-March; while this is a transition season, the knitwear demand appears consistent. I will use recent_N (N=4) to forecast demand based on the post-launch stabilization. Lead time is confirmed as 4, so I will stick with the default promised lead time to guide the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand stabilized post-launch at ~77 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a fine rib knit sweater. Period 1-4 demand values were 53, 80, 88, 75. Periods 5-6 since stock arrival were 67 and 51. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Current on-hand is 184 and in-transit is 153. Historical samples (pre-game: 15, 50, 198, 60, 68; in-game: 53, 80, 88, 75, 67, 51) show a mean around 73. Excluding the spike of 198, the mean is approximately 67. Given high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), we aim for a service level around 50%, requiring tight alignment of base stock to mean demand. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the in-game demand regime (mean ~69) and the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-145.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 574109012 (fitted sweater) is entering the spring season. Historical arrivals for Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm the lead time is exactly 4 periods (as promised). Demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last three weeks: from 67 (P5) to 51 (P6) to 32 (P7), likely due to the seasonal transition away from sweaters. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is 50. In contrast, the earlier demand samples (pre-launch and early launch) averaged much higher (~77-80). I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent cooling of demand. With 177 units on hand and 136 in transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), the pipeline of 313 units is more than sufficient for the next 5 periods (L+1) given the current demand rate (~50/period). The logic will likely trigger a very small or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs as demand wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: demand dropped to 32, trailing a 3-period average of 50, significantly lower than the launch average of 77. This suggests a seasonal decline for this knitwear item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-179.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knitwear item ('Rachel LS TVP'). Current data shows a clear downward demand trend as the season transitions into spring (April). Demand has dropped from a launch average of ~77 to a recent 3-period average of 34 (32, 20 from history, and a noted shift at Period 7/8). Specifically, the last two periods recorded 32 and 20 units. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods by consecutive deliveries. Current on-hand inventory (199) plus in-transit (94) is 293 units. Given the declining trend and high holding costs (equal to unit profit), a conservative base stock is necessary to avoid overstocking a seasonal item. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this downward momentum and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at lower demand levels. This will likely result in zero new orders this period since existing inventory significantly exceeds the projected 5-period demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed as seasonal decline: demand averaged 26 over the last 2 periods (P7-P8), down 66% from the launch average of 77. Inventory risk is high as spring progresses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top (Rachel LS TVP). As we enter mid-April (2019/4/15), demand has continued its significant downward trend, dropping from a launch average of ~77 to a recent 3-period average of 23 units (32, 20, 17). This aligns with seasonal expectations for knitwear as spring progresses. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 183 units on-hand and 93 in-transit (total 276) against a current weekly demand of ~17-20 units, we are severely overstocked (approx. 14 weeks of coverage). My goal is to prevent further ordering by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new, lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent drop and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at lower demand levels. This will ensure the base_stock calculation remains below our current pipeline inventory, effectively halting new orders while we clear the existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-9 average demand is 23 units, down from launch average of 77 (-70%), identifying a strong seasonal decline for knitwear in spring.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit sweater (Divided Collection), which is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as we move further into spring (late April). Demand has dropped from a launch average of ~77 units to a recent 4-period average (P7-P10) of approximately 20.5 units (32, 20, 17, 13), showing a consistent downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 255 units, which covers over 12 periods of demand at the current rate\u2014far exceeding the lead time requirements. With a lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we are in a significant overstock position given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (N=4) to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we draw down the existing high inventory levels. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect the lower volatility in this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: period 7-10 average demand is 20.5 units, continuing the seasonal decline of knitwear in spring (down from launch mean of 77).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved knitwear item ('Rachel LS TVP'), which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as spring and summer approach. Demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has averaged 19.8 units, significantly lower than the launch average of 77 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 246 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand rate of ~20 units/period, the on-hand stock covers approximately 12 periods of demand, which is well beyond the (L+1) = 5 period planning horizon. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P7 orders all arriving with L=4). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate. The OR backend will likely order zero units because the pipeline inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~20 units/period over P7-P11, confirming a seasonal low for knitwear as summer arrives.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a 'Rachel LS TVP', a long-sleeve knitwear item, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as temperatures rise in spring and summer. Historical demand samples (before simulation) were as high as 198, but during the simulation, demand peaked at 88 in Period 3 and has since fallen to an average of approximately 20 units over the last 6 periods (P7-P12). Currently, on-hand inventory is 221 units with zero in-transit, providing over 10 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low seasonal demand, the goal is to prevent further ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. For the mu_hat parameter, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the stabilized low-demand regime (Periods 7-12) where the mean is ~20.6. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively stopping new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a seasonal low of ~21 units/period (P7-P12) for this knitwear item as summer approaches.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (long-sleeve knitwear) is currently in a seasonal low demand phase as summer approaches (May 13). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the initial launch period. Over the last 7 periods (P7-P13), demand has averaged 19.7 units, compared to the launch average of ~77 units. Current on-hand inventory is 207 units, which is exceptionally high given the current demand rate (sufficient for ~10 weeks). As arrivals for P8 onwards were 0 or very small (85 in P10 and 8 in P11 were the last significant arrivals), the pipeline is now empty. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further holding costs by using the most recent demand data to reflect the seasonal dip. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. Given the excessive stock, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a knitwear sweater (Rachel LS TVP) which is experiencing a deep seasonal decline as we move into late May (Period 15). Demand over the last five periods (P10-P14) has averaged 15.2 units, with a very low demand of 7 units in the most recent period. The current on-hand inventory is 200 units, which represents approximately 13 periods of cover at recent demand levels. Given the daily holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly detrimental to total reward. No new orders should be placed. I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current low demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the confirmed 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to the calculated base stock will naturally result in zero orders from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a seasonal low: P10-P14 average demand is 15.2 units, confirming negligible demand for this knitwear item as summer starts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-188.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit sweater reaching the end of May (Period 16). Demand has shown a clear and sustained decline as the season moves from spring into summer. Specifically, over the last five periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 13.8 units, with the most recent two weeks dropping to 7 and 6 units (a ~90% decrease from the launch peak of 88). On-hand inventory is 194 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods (L=4) and a review period of 1, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current rate of ~7-10 units per week, 5 periods would require only ~50 units. With 194 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked for the summer season. To prevent creating unnecessary orders and minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I am using 'recent_N' for the demand forecast (mu_hat) with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime, and 'default' for other parameters. This will result in a base stock level far below current inventory, effectively halting ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: P11-P15 average demand is 13.8 units, confirming the end of the seasonal peak for this knitwear item. Current on-hand inventory (194) is sufficient for ~15-20 weeks at current demand rates.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '574109012' is a long-sleeved rib-knit top, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as summer approaches. The current date is June 3rd. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 11.2 units, with the most recent period dropping to 4 units. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm this seasonal low. Current on-hand inventory is 190 units, which, at the current average demand rate, represents over 15 weeks of supply. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is highly detrimental to total rewards. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and avoid unnecessary ordering while liquidating current stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: P12-P16 average demand is 11.2 units (down from initial highs of ~80). With 190 units on hand, inventory coverage exceeds remaining seasonal relevance for this knitwear item.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). The item is a 'Rachel LS TVP' (knitwear/sweater), which is experiencing significant seasonal decline as summer begins. Demand has been consistently low for the past 6 periods (averaging 7 units since Period 13). Specifically, the last 4 periods have seen demand of 7, 6, 4, and 6 units respectively. With an on-hand inventory of 184 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers approximately 26-30 weeks of demand at current rates. Given that the profit margin equals the holding cost (1:1), any excess inventory beyond immediate needs is highly detrimental to the total reward. I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this persistent low-demand regime (avg ~5.4 units/period), causing the OR backend to place zero orders, which is the optimal strategy to burn down the significant overstock and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal minimum: P13-P17 average demand is 7.4 units, confirming extremely low summer demand for this sweater SKU.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is the start of summer. The product is a 'long sleeves... knitwear' sweater, which is highly seasonal and currently in its off-season. Demand has stabilized at a very low level (P13-P18 average is ~7 units/period, with the most recent week at 4 units). The current on-hand inventory of 180 units is extremely high relative to this demand level, covering approximately 25-45 weeks of sales. Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical objective is to prevent any further accumulation of inventory and maximize profit by selling through existing stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters with N=6 to capture the current summer low (P13-P18: 14, 7, 6, 4, 6, 4). No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend as the on-hand inventory far exceeds any reasonable base stock level for this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed: P14-P18 demand averages 5.4 units/period, establishing the seasonal minimum for this long-sleeved knitwear item.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product is a long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater. Demand has continued to drop to its seasonal floor, with the last five periods (P15-P19) showing demand values of 6, 4, 6, 4, and 2 units, averaging 4.4 units per period. We have 178 units on hand and zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, the on-hand inventory provides approximately 40 weeks of coverage, far exceeding any requirements for the summer season and likely sufficient to last until the autumn demand recovery. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat at recent minimums using the last 5 periods (N=5), ensuring the OR backend sees no need for additional orders given the high on-hand stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a deep summer seasonal low for this long-sleeved knitwear item (Period 21, July 1st). Demand has effectively hit zero (Period 20 demand: 0), with the rolling average of the last 5 periods being approximately 2.4 units. On-hand inventory stands at 178 units, which, at current demand rates, represents over a year of supply. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5; however, given the massive inventory surplus, no orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current 'floor' demand regime, ensuring the calculated base stock remains far below the existing on-hand inventory to prevent any new ordering while minimizing potential holding cost impact if the engine were to order (which it shouldn't, given the pipeline). Predicted lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Zero demand observed in Period 20; Period 16-20 average demand is 3.2 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knitwear sweater (Rachel LS TVP) in July, which is the seasonal nadir for such items. Historical demand has plummeted from a peak of ~80 units in early spring to near-zero (averaging 1.4 units/period over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 177 units, which provides massive coverage for the current demand regime. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.00), the priority is maximizing inventory depletion while minimizing further holding costs. No further orders are needed for the foreseeable future, as current stock exceeds any reasonable expected demand for several months. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand floor using a recent window (N=5) to avoid over-ordering based on obsolete high-demand data from the launch phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater, which is currently in its seasonal trough during the summer (July). Current demand is extremely low, with only 1-2 units per period over the last few weeks (P21: 1, P22: 2, P20: 0). On-hand inventory is 175 units, which provides over 80 periods of coverage at the current demand rate (~2 units/period). Since the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to the profit margin ($1.0), the critical ratio (q = 0.5) implies a lean inventory strategy. No further ordering is required. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR backend's calculated base stock remains far below current on-hand levels, preventing unnecessary ordering while minimizing holding costs.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product (a long-sleeved knit sweater) is in the middle of a deep summer seasonal low. Over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), the total demand was only 5 units (avg 1.0 unit/period). On-hand inventory is 175 units with zero in-transit, which at the current demand rate provides over 150 weeks of coverage. Given that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00), the goal is to prevent any new orders until the inventory level is significantly reduced or demand rebounds sharply for autumn. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current near-zero demand floor and will use 'default' for L as the lead time is stable at 4. This will set a very low base stock, ensuring no further units are ordered.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The SKU is a long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' knitwear item, which is currently in its off-season (summer). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has been extremely low: 0, 1, 2, 0, 1 (average 0.8 units/period). On-hand inventory is 174 units with zero in-transit. Given the current demand rate and the nature of the product, the current stock is sufficient for over 200 periods, far exceeding the remaining game duration or seasonal relevance. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio for the base stock level would typically target a 50% service level, but the high on-hand inventory effectively mandates zero ordering. I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current summer demand floor (avg ~0.8) and standard lead time parameters. No orders should be triggered.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019 (Period 26). The product is a long-sleeved sweater, which is currently in a deep seasonal trough (summer). Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 2.0 units per period (1, 2, 0, 1, 6). While the spike to 6 in P25 might hint at very early pre-fall interest, the current on-hand inventory of 168 units is extremely high, covering over 80 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the priority is strictly to deplete the massive surplus rather than ordering more. I will set the lead time to default (4) and use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stagnant summer demand floor, ensuring the base stock calculation remains significantly below our on-hand inventory to prevent any new orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 27 (2019/08/12). A significant demand spike was observed in Period 26 (demand = 21), following a long summer trough where demand averaged ~2 units/period. This aligns with the transition from late summer to pre-fall, which typically sees a resurgence in demand for long-sleeved knitwear/sweaters across many markets. While demand is increasing, our current on-hand inventory of 147 units is substantial. Even if demand returns to the early launch mean of ~77 units/period, 147 units would cover approximately two periods. Given the lead time of 4 periods and high holding costs ($1/unit), we must avoid over-ordering until the magnitude of the fall recovery is confirmed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this upward shift while relying on the existing inventory buffer to mitigate risk. No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR backend yet due to the high stock level relative to the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall recovery detected at Period 26: Demand increased to 21 units (up from previous 5-period average of ~2), signaling the end of the summer low for this knitwear SKU.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Rachel LS TVP' is a long-sleeved sweater, which is entering its primary autumn sales season (late August). Recent demand (Period 26: 21, Period 27: 32) confirms the pre-fall recovery previously detected. We are now seeing a clear upward trend as summer ends. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure coverage for the next 5 periods (L+1). Acknowledging the start of the autumn regime, I will use a 3-period average (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent ramp-up (P25-P27 avg: 19.6 units/period). This results in a predicted demand of ~98 units over the lead time plus one period. Since current on-hand (115) still covers this, the OR backend likely won't place a large order yet, but setting these parameters allows the system to react immediately as demand continues to climb toward the historical launch levels (~50-80 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand increased for two consecutive periods (21 to 32), with the P25-P27 average (19.6) significantly exceeding the summer floor (~2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Rachel LS TVP' (a long-sleeved knitwear item) is confirming a strong autumn recovery. Starting from a summer floor of ~2 units/period, demand has risen sequentially for three periods: 21, 32, and now 42 units in Period 28. This aligns with late August back-to-school and pre-fall shopping. Current on-hand inventory is 73 units with zero in-transit, providing only about 1.5 periods of coverage at the current demand rate, while the lead time is 4 periods. Since the service level calculation (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) is 0.5, the base stock targets the median demand over (L+1) periods. To avoid stocking out during the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value reflecting the current upward trend. Using the most recent demand (42) as a baseline for the next (L+1=5) periods results in a target of 210. Under the capped policy, this will trigger a necessary replenishment order to meet the anticipated autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (21, 32, 42), reaching its highest level since Period 6. P26-P28 average is 31.6 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019). The SKU is a long-sleeved knit sweater, which is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged significantly over the last 4 periods (21, 32, 42, 37), clearly moving from a summer floor of ~2 units to an autumn ramp-up phase. The current average over the last 4 periods is 33 units. Given the seasonal relevance of knitwear in September, I expect demand to keep rising or sustain at these higher levels. Current on-hand inventory is 36, and there are 60 units in-transit (ordered P29, expected P33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this ramp-up, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new demand regime (approx 33 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+4)*33 = 165. The OR backend will subtract the 96 units of pipeline inventory (36 on-hand + 60 in-transit) and place an appropriate order to meet the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: P26-P29 demand average is 33.0 units/period, marking a significant and sustained increase from the summer floor (<5 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn season (September). Recent demand has spiked significantly, with Period 30 reaching 123 units, causing a stockout (on-hand is now 0). The 4-period moving average (P27-P30) is 58.5 units/period, but given the 123 units in P30 and the seasonal relevance of a 'long-sleeved knitwear fitted top' in September, demand is expected to accelerate or sustain these high levels. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The current pipeline of 108 units (ordered P29 and P30) will not arrive until P33-P34. To ensure we cover demand across the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), and given the sharp surge to 123, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent high-demand observation to prevent further stockouts. Setting N=4 for sigma_hat captures the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 30 demand surged to 123 units, a 270% increase over the P26-P29 average, resulting in an immediate stockout.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knitwear item ('Rachel LS TVP') entering its peak autumn season. We have observed a significant demand surge over the last two periods (123 and 139 units), far exceeding the initial autumn recovery of ~33 units/period. Period 31 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout. There is currently a pipeline of 270 units: Period 29 (60), Period 30 (48), and Period 31 (162). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the first shipment of 60 units is expected to arrive in Period 33 conclude (readable P34). Given the current demand level (~130 units/period) and a total lead time + review cycle of 5 periods (L+1), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the time until the P31 order (162 units) arrives in Period 35. My forecast for mu_hat uses the recent average of the surge (Periods 30-31 average ~131) over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1 = 5), totaling ~655. To avoid further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the high volume and increased volatility observed during the autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified at Period 30: demand surged to 131 units/period average (P30-P31), representing a 300% increase over the early autumn recovery phase (P26-P29).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn peak (mean demand ~128 units/period over the last 3 periods: P30=123, P31=139, P32=121). We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0) while waiting for significant in-transit orders (420 units) to arrive. The earliest arrival (ordered P29) is expected at the start of Period 34 (P29 + L=4 + 1 observation delay), meaning we will likely remain stocked out for at least one more period. Given the transition into late September (peak knitwear season), demand is expected to remain high and volatile. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current peak (avg ~128) and using explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility during this recovery phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: P30-P32 average demand is 127.7 units/period, a massive increase from the early autumn recovery (P26-P29 avg ~33). Stockout persists until P29 order arrival in P34.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn demand period for this knitwear item (late September). Demand has surged significantly, with Period 33 demand reaching 216 units, continuing a massive upward trend (P30-P33 average demand is 149.75 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). We are currently experiencing a stockout, as the 60 units that arrived in P33 were immediately sold out. We have 504 units in the pipeline (orders from P30-P33). Because demand has moved from a recovery phase (~33 units) to a peak phase (~150 units), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (the duration of the peak) to capture this new regime. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for higher volatility during this high-demand phase. The OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent over-ordering if this surge is a short-term spike, while the base stock will attempt to satisfy the high demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30-33 average demand is 149.8 units/period, compared to the early autumn recovery average of 33.0. Stockout persists despite pipeline arrivals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Rachel LS TVP' is a long-sleeved knitwear item, currently experiencing a significant autumn peak. Period 34 demand was 139 units, with an average over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) of 147.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since my pipeline inventory of 643 units covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand (643 / 147.6), and I am currently stocked out (on-hand = 0), I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods). An N size of 5 for mu_hat captures the recent heavy demand regime. This strategy aims to refill inventory quickly while preventing excessive overstocking as we move deeper into autumn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed: Period 30-34 average demand is 147.6 units/period, maintaining the high-demand regime as peak sweater season continues. Pipeline (643) is now catching up to this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its autumn peak season (long-sleeved knitwear). Demand has shifted from a summer floor of ~2 units to a high-demand regime starting around Period 30. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 140.3 units. Although Period 35 demand (104) was lower than previous weeks, it remains significantly above the early autumn recovery mean (~33), suggesting a high-level plateau rather than a decline. On-hand inventory is 58, and there are 576 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, leading the OR engine to target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (Period 30-35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory pipeline covers the (L+1) window appropriately for this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime sustained: Period 30-35 average demand remains high at 140.3 units/period, despite a slight dip in P35.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (Sweater/Knitwear) is currently in its autumn peak regime. Historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle: demand was high in Feb-Mar, dropped significantly in spring/summer, and recovered sharply starting in Period 26. The peak intensity was roughly Periods 30-34 (avg ~147 units). Recent data (Periods 35-36) shows a softening to 104 and 90 units, suggesting the initial 'surge' phase of autumn might be transitioning into a more stable high-demand plateau or a very gradual late-autumn decline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 118 units on hand and 494 in transit (total 612), the pipeline is finally catching up with the seasonal demand. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the full autumn recovery and recent peak (Periods 30-36 avg ~118 units/period), as this provides a safer buffer against stockouts while acknowledging the slight cooling of the peak observed in the most recent two periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed: Demand softened in Periods 35-36 (104, 90) compared to the Period 30-34 surge (avg ~147), but remains significant. Average demand for the active autumn season (P30-P36) is 118.4 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this knitwear item is currently in its autumn peak. While the surge observed between Periods 30-34 (reaching as high as 216 demand) has moderated, it remains significant. The average demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) is 94.3 units/period, compared to the broader autumn peak average (P30-P37) of 114.7. Given the date (late October), we are likely at the height of the season, and demand is expected to stay robust but stable before the transition to winter. On-hand inventory is 173 and in-transit is 404, totaling 577 units. With lead time L=4, my parameters need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=8 for the current demand regime (P30-P37) captures the peak behavior and provides a buffer. The OR backend will calculate a base stock around 573 units (114.7 * 5), which is currently covered by pipeline, so the order will likely be small or zero, preventing overstock as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau sustained: P35-P37 demand average is 94.3 units/period, showing a consolidation from the P30-P33 surge while remaining significantly higher than early autumn levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for this 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater. After a massive surge in demand during September (averaging ~150), demand has stabilized into a 'plateau' regime over the last four periods (P35-P38: 104, 90, 89, 93), averaging 94 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 267 and in-transit is 279, totaling 546 units. With a lead time of 4, our base stock targets demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Under the current regime, 5 periods of demand is approximately 470 units. Since our pipeline inventory (546) already exceeds this coverage, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce order sizes to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the year. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilized plateau (94 units/period) rather than the earlier hyper-growth phase to improve forecast accuracy and inventory efficiency.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed: Period 35-38 demand has stabilized at an average of 94.0 units/period, down from the September surge average of ~150 but much higher than lead-in levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this knitwear item (574109012) is showing a gradual decrease as we move deeper into November (P39 demand was 63, compared to the P35-P38 average of 94). This suggests the peak autumn surge has passed and we are entering a late-autumn/early-winter phase where demand is stabilizing at a lower, but still significant, level. Current on-hand inventory (299) plus in-transit stock (184) totals 483 units. With the promised lead time of 4 periods and a current 5-period demand average of approximately 80 units (P35-P39: 104, 90, 89, 93, 63 -> avg 87.8), the inventory position is adequate to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) without aggressive new ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent cooling of demand, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen across the autumn season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau shifting to gradual decline: Period 39 demand (63) is 33% lower than the P35-P38 average (94), signaling the end of the peak autumn regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-255.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this knitwear item is entering a clear decline as we move further into November (P40 demand = 56, down from the P35-P38 plateau avg of ~94). With 311 units on hand and 116 units in transit, the total inventory position is 427 units. Even at the previous plateau rate of ~94 units/period, this would cover over 4.5 periods of demand. Given the current downward trend (63 in P39, 56 in P40), inventory coverage likely extends well beyond the remaining 7 periods of the game. Additional ordering is unnecessary and would only increase holding costs. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect the current declining trend (mean of P38-P40 is ~70.7) and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture current volatility. This will result in a base stock level lower than current inventory, effectively halting new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to late-autumn decline confirmed: Period 39-40 demand (63, 56) is ~37% lower than the Period 35-38 plateau (avg 94), indicating the passing of the seasonal peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this long-sleeved knitwear SKU is in a clear post-peak decline as we approach the end of November (Period 41). Demand has decreased steadily over the last three periods: 63, 56, and 45. The average demand for these most recent 3 periods is approximately 54.7 units, which is a significant drop from the October plateau average of ~94 units. Current on-hand inventory is 320 units, with 62 units still in transit arriving in the next period. At the current demand rate of ~45-55 units, the existing on-hand stock and final pipeline arrival represent approximately 7-8 weeks of coverage. Given there are only 5 periods remaining in the game (ending at P47), we are currently overstocked. No further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent 3-period demand regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the lower demand and avoids ordering against the 320 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand decline confirmed: Period 39-41 demand (63, 56, 45) shows a continuous downward trend, averaging 54.7 units, a ~42% reduction from the Period 35-38 plateau (avg 94).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (168 units) which coincided with the week of November 25th (Black Friday week). This is a known high-volume retail event. This spike contradicts the previous trend of late-autumn decline (P39-P41 avg ~55). However, given it is early December (P43 starts Dec 2), demand is likely to remain higher than the November low but below the Black Friday peak as we head toward the holiday season. The on-hand inventory is 214 units with no outstanding in-transit orders. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 47, we are within the final 5-period window (L+1). My goal is to ensure availability for the holiday season while winding down inventory to avoid holding costs at the game's end. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (including the spike) to account for some holiday demand without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: demand surged to 168 units, significantly deviating from the late-autumn decline pattern. This is a seasonal event, not a permanent regime shift.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), reflecting on post-Black Friday (P42) demand. In Period 43, demand returned to 65 units, which aligns with the 'late-autumn decline' regime observed prior to the spike (P39-P41 averaged ~55 units). This confirms that the Period 42 surge (168 units) was a transient Black Friday event and not a new sustained regime. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (concluding at P47), we must avoid over-ordering for a seasonal product (knitwear) likely to drop in demand as we approach the end of the year. The current on-hand (149) plus in-transit (178, which represents the order placed in P43) totals 327 units. Against a recent non-spike average of ~60 units, this provides over 5 periods of coverage. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (including the spike) to maintain a safe but conservative base stock, and default lead time as it has been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43: 65 units) confirms the surge in P42 was a transient event; demand has returned to the late-autumn regime levels (~60 units/period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P43: 65, P44: 46) confirms that the P42 surge (168) was a transient Black Friday event. Demand has reverted to the late-autumn decline regime. The average demand for the three most recent standard periods (P41, P43, P44) is approximately 52 units/period, excluding the outlier. With 47 periods total, we are in P45, meaning only 2 decision periods remain. Current on-hand is 103, and 248 units are in-transit (reaching us in P47 and P48). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P41-P44) while acknowledging that P42 was an outlier, making the 'recent_N' average slightly inflated but safe for the final weeks. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), I aim to avoid excess stock at the game's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-autumn/early-winter demand regime. Period 45 demand (85) reflects a pre-holiday lift, similar to the pattern seen in Period 42 (Black Friday) but at a smaller scale. Following the logic of the Carry-over Insights from P44, demand has returned to a base level of roughly 60 units after major spikes, with some holiday volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current demand context: P43-P45 demand averages 65.3 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P43-P45) to capture this post-peak stabilization while accounting for recent holiday-related variation. With 18 on-hand and 302 in-transit, our total inventory position (320) covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average (65 * 5 = 325), which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak regime stabilized: Period 43-45 average demand is 65.3 units/period, down significantly from the Sept/Oct peak but stable for the late-winter period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-December/early-January period. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) as of the end of Period 46. Demand in recent periods (P45: 85, P46: 93) has been surprisingly high compared to the late-autumn baseline of ~60, likely due to holiday sales/post-Christmas clearance. However, total pipeline inventory is 309, which significantly exceeds the current 5-period average demand (~71 units/period) multiplied by (L+1). Orders from P39-P42 were 0, explaining the current gap in arrivals. Shipments from P43 onwards (178 units) are expected to begin arriving in Period 47 (today). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the likely seasonal drop-off in knitwear demand after the New Year, I will set parameters to prevent further over-ordering while the backend clears the existing 309-strong pipeline. I am using recent_N (N=4) for demand to capture the recent holiday elevation while acknowledging the pipeline is already sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: P45-P46 average demand (89 units) is ~36% higher than the P43-P44 baseline (55 units), likely representing a final seasonal peak before the January clearance drop-off.
