Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt). Historical demand samples are 97, 79, 82, 148, 102. The mean demand is 101.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.1. The promised lead time is 4. Although Feb 14 (Valentine's Day) is upcoming, the historical data (Jan-Feb) does not show a massive spike yet, though the Jan 28 sample (148) was elevated. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, we need to establish a base stock to cover the review period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use all 5 historical samples to set the initial forecast parameters.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Bella waistbelt'. Historical demand samples range from 79 to 148, with the most recent sample (P1) being 54. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed P1) hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so that order isn't expected until P5. In-transit inventory is 148. Because on-hand is 0, we had a stockout in P1 (demand 54, sold 0). To stabilize the forecast, I will use a conservative mean based on the 5 pre-game samples plus the P1 observation. The mean of {97, 79, 82, 148, 102, 54} is approximately 93.7. With a promised lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 93.7 = 468.5. For sigma_hat, the sample standard deviation is ~32; sqrt(5) * 32 is ~71.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available history until a cleaner regime emerges.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0 due to the 4-period promised lead time; no orders have arrived yet. Customer demand in Periods 1 (54) and 2 (45) was lost because of zero stock. The product is a women's waist belt. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) average 101.6 units/week. Since the most recent samples (97, 79, 82, 148, 102) and recent period demands (54, 45) show some volatility but no definitive regime shift yet, I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand parameters to reflect the recent baseline while accounting for some variability. Lead time L is set to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a departure from the promised lead time. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'Bella waistbelt' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). Consistent with a lead time of 4, no arrivals have been recorded yet. Demand in the first three periods (54, 45, 35) is slightly lower than the initial historical samples (mean ~101), suggesting a potential downward shift or seasonal variation. However, with only 3 periods of game data, it is too early to confirm a permanent regime shift. I will use the mean of the total period demand samples (historical + game history) to forecast. Total samples: 97, 79, 82, 148, 102 (hist) and 54, 45, 35 (game). Total Mean \u2248 80.5. For L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 80.5 * 5 = 402.5. Since the pipeline (449) already exceeds this mu_hat, the backend will likely place a minimal or zero order to avoid excess holding costs while waiting for arrivals to stabilize.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Bella waistbelt'. Looking at the demand history (samples and observed periods), demand has dropped from ~100 units in Jan/Feb to an average of ~37 units over the last 4 weeks. I will use recent_N=4 to better reflect this lower demand regime. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (148 units) is scheduled to arrive DURING Period 5 (this period) and will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (available at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 470 units in transit (matching the sum of orders from P1-P4). No signals of lost shipments yet, as P1's lead time hasn't expired relative to the observation window. The OR backend will use the lower mu_hat to avoid over-ordering while awaiting the arrival of the initial large batches.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's waist belt. Historical demand samples (Period -4 to 0) were: 97, 79, 82, 148, 102 (Avg: 101). Observed demand since the start of the simulation (Periods 1-5) has been significantly lower: 54, 45, 35, 14, 11 (Avg: 31.8). This indicates a sharp downward regime shift compared to the pre-game data. In Period 5, we finally received our first shipment from Period 1 (148 units), confirming the promised lead time (L=4). There are currently 322 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, and 4), which is more than enough to cover the current low demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent low demand trend (~32 units/period). Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: Average demand dropped from ~100 to ~32 units per period (approx -68% decrease).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) has a promised lead time of 4. Observation of Period 5 and 6 concludes confirms the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: pre-game samples (Period -4 to 0) averaged ~101 units, but actual demand since Period 1 has averaged ~32.6 units (54, 45, 35, 14, 11, 37). The Carry-over insight correctly identified this -68% drop. Currently, we have 246 units on hand and 176 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). At current demand rates (~35 units/week), we have roughly 7 weeks of stock on hand and 5 weeks in transit, totaling 12 weeks of coverage against an L+1=5 week protection interval. The OR backend will automatically calculate a near-zero order due to the high pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime and L to 'default' as the promised lead time matches observations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). Looking at the demand history since the inventory started arriving in Period 5, the demand has been low (11, 37, 13). Combined with the unfulfilled demand from early periods (54, 45, 35, 14), the average demand since Period 1 is approximately 32.7 units/period, which is a significant drop from the pre-game samples (~100 units/period). This confirms the demand regime shift noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 conclusions). We currently have 388 units on-hand and 21 in-transit (ordered Period 4, expected to arrive this period). Given the low demand and high holding cost compared to profit (1:4 ratio), our stock level is already very high (covering >10 periods of current demand). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 7 periods of game history to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's waist belt. Since P1, demand has significantly dropped and stabilized at a low level (average of 28.5 units/period over the last 8 periods, compared to ~100 in the pre-history). Specifically, demand from P5-P8 was 11, 37, 13, and 10 units, indicating a mean around 18 units recently. We have a massive overstock (On-hand: 399) relative to this demand, as previous large orders placed in P1-P3 (148, 146, 155) have now arrived. With a lead time of 4 and current demand, our target base stock should be much lower than the current inventory + pipeline. Actual lead time is confirmed to be exactly the promised 4 periods for all 4 concluded shipments. To prevent further unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs ($1/unit), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent data (last 8 periods since the regime shift) and use the calculate method for lead time as it is stable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) has experienced a significant demand drop compared to the pre-game samples. Since Period 1, demand has averaged ~25 units per period. Currently, there are 394 units on-hand with zero in-transit, providing approximately 15 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory level (holding cost $1.0 vs profit $4.0) and the low actual demand (Period 9 demand was only 5), the OR backend should minimize further orders. I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current lower demand regime since Period 1 and setting L to calculate to reflect the consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P11 (2019/4/22). History shows a significant demand drop compared to the initial seed data. Since P1, actual demand has averaged 24.7 units, and the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) have averaged 17.6 units. The inventory level is currently very high (371 units on-hand) relative to this low demand level, likely due to large orders placed in P1-P3 arriving against a falling demand regime. All placed orders (P1-P4) have arrived with the promised lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, and P8 conclusions). There is currently no in-transit inventory. With on-hand inventory covering over 20 weeks of current demand, the objective is to prevent further ordering until stock is depleted. I will use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the post-drop demand regime (approx 25 units/period) and default lead time settings. The high on-hand levels will trigger the OR backend to not place new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels (avg ~25) since P1; current on-hand inventory is significantly overstocked relative to current demand trends.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Bella waistbelt' (589748001) has seen a drastic demand reduction since the start of the observation period, dropping from a pre-period mean of ~100 to an average of ~25.8 units per period over the last 11 weeks. Currently, there is an extreme overstock situation with 335 units on-hand and an average demand of only ~26 units. This equates to nearly 13 weeks of inventory. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) from a calculated target. Given the current surplus, no orders should be placed. To prevent the system from accidentally ordering due to historical high-demand volatility (standard deviation from the first few high-demand weeks), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' where N=11. This captures the lower demand regime that has persisted for the entire observed history. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) is currently in a significantly overstocked position with 292 units on-hand, while demand has averaged only 23.3 units per period since Period 1. Historical data shows demand has shifted from ~100 pre-game to a much lower regime. In recent periods (P10-P12), there is a slight upward trend in demand (23, 36, 43), likely due to spring seasonality for accessories. Despite this slight increase, the inventory levels are more than 10x the current weekly demand. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime to ensure no new orders are placed until the excess stock is depleted. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period 1 behavior while acknowledging the recent slight uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Period 1 has stabilized to a lower regime (avg ~23) but shows a potential seasonal uptick in late April/early May (P11-P12); however, on-hand inventory remains extremely high relative to current sales.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is May 13th (Period 14). Demand for the 'Bella waistbelt' has shifted significantly from its pre-game level (~100) to a lower regime since Period 1 (~28.5 avg). Recently, there has been a slight uptick in demand during late April/early May (Periods 11-13 averaging ~37.7), likely corresponding to spring fashion seasonality. However, the current on-hand inventory (258 units) is extremely high relative to current demand, representing over 6-7 weeks of stock at recent consumption rates. Lead times are consistently tracking at the promised 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive overstock, the priority remains to avoid ordering and allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward a level that justifies new replenishment. Choosing the 'recent_N' method with N=13 for mu_hat correctly captures the post-Period 1 lower demand regime (~28.5/week), while using standard lead time parameters. The OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new order is placed while pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand for the 'Bella waistbelt' has shifted from an initial high mean (~100 units pre-game) to a much lower regime averaging approximately 27 units over the last 10 periods (P5-P14). While there was a slight uptick in demand during late-April/early-May (P11-P13 peaks at 43), the current on-hand inventory of 222 units is still extremely high, covering roughly 8 periods of demand at the current average rate. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met based on historical arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). Since the system is currently overstocked, no new orders should be placed. To ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the recent 10-period regime (N=10) to reflect the lower demand accurately, while L is maintained at the default promised lead time. This allows the inventory to naturally bleed down towards an appropriate base stock level.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Period 15 saw a significant spike in demand (105 units), which is likely a localized peak or clearing of stock rather than a sustained new regime, as the item is a 'Wide waist belt' and historical demand since February has averaged around 30 units per period. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory (117) still covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand at the average rate. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The goal is to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering due to the single demand spike in Period 15 while maintaining a safe stock level as inventory depletes. I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods (capturing the low regime and the spike) to provide a balanced forecast, and use regular lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand spike to 105 units observed (approx 3.5x previous low-regime average); monitoring for sustained increase or return to mean (~30).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (June 3). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift. After a long period of low demand (avg ~25 units/period), we observed a spike in Period 15 (105 units) and Period 16 (93 units). This indicates a move into a summer seasonal peak for this wide waist belt. The on-hand inventory has dropped sharply to 24 units. With a lead time of 4 periods and the current demand at ~100/week, the pipeline (75 units in-transit from P16 + 24 units on-hand) is insufficient to cover the expected demand for the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). We need to set parameters that reflect this higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate seasonality spike (average ~99) while maintaining the Lead Time at the promised 'default' of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Periods 15-16 show demand (~100 units) roughly 4x the previous low-regime average, coinciding with the start of the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant seasonal spike in Periods 15 and 16 (demand approx. 100), followed by a drop in Period 17 (demand 28). However, Period 17 sales were stockout-constrained (on-hand 24, demand 28, ending inventory 0), which often suppresses reported demand. The product ('Bella waistbelt') is likely entering a peak summer season based on the date (June 10). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 188 units in transit (ordered in P16 and P17). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, these units won't arrive until Period 20 and 21. To capture the summer peak while accounting for the high volatility ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost justifies a high service level), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the transition from the low regime to the current summer levels (Avg demand around 75). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility of this transition. Lead time remains at the default (promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Stockout occurred in Period 17 (demand 28 vs 24 available). True demand potential for the current summer regime may be higher than recorded sales. Pipeline inventory (188 units) is set to arrive starting P20.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0) with a demand profile that spiked in high summer (P15-P16: ~100 units), but has since seen constrained sales due to zero inventory (P18: demand 17, but likely higher if stock existed). The pipeline contains 332 units: 75 ordered P16 (due P20), 113 ordered P17 (due P21), and 144 ordered P18 (due P22). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the summer spike (P15-P18), resulting in an average demand of 60.75 ((105+93+28+17)/4). This leads to a mu_hat of 303.75 ((1+4) * 60.75). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of this summer regime. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to satisfy high seasonal demand once the pipeline starts arriving, while accounting for current zero-stock status.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20, experiencing a stockout since Period 17 (due to a demand spike in P15-P16 and delayed arrivals). On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 388 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our last confirmed arrival was in Period 8 (ordered P4). The order from Period 16 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 20 (this period), and will be visible in the Period 21 decision phase. We are in a summer seasonal regime. Demand in P15-P16 was ~100/period, but dropped significantly in P18-P19 (17 and 33 units). This volatility suggests a higher sigma_hat is needed. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current volatile summer demand (P15-P19 avg: 55.2) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. Since the pipeline (388) is very large compared to current demand, the OR backend's inventory balancing and capping should naturally limit further over-ordering once arrivals commence.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (starting P15) exhibits high volatility: saw spikes of ~100 units followed by drops to ~17-33 units. True demand in P17-P19 may be slightly understated due to stockouts, but the recent trend is lower than the initial spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in the peak summer season for the 'Bella waistbelt'. Looking at the demand history since the summer regime shift in Period 15, we see high volatility: demand spikes of 105 and 93, followed by lower but significant demand between 17 and 33. Note that periods 17-19 resulted in stockouts (0 sales reflected in ending inventory), so true demand was likely higher than the recorded units sold. We just received 75 units (ordered P16), bringing on-hand to 47. However, there is a large pipeline of 238 units (+ any ordered this period) arriving over the next three weeks (orders from P17, P18, P19). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (see P5-P8 and P20 arrivals). To manage this summer regime, I will use a N=6 period window (P15-P20) to capture the higher mean and elevated volatility of the summer season, which better reflects the current risk than the long-term average. This will help the OR backend ensure that on-hand plus pipeline inventory is sufficient for the (L+1) window, while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering given the large existing pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P15-P21) confirms a move into a summer demand regime characterized by high volatility, with demand spikes reaching ~100 units (P15, P16, P21) and lulls around ~20-30 units (P17-P20). The current period (P22) is July 8th, mid-summer, where demand for accessories like the 'Bella waistbelt' is expected to remain elevated but volatile. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P16 arrived P20, P17 arrived P21). We current have 84 units on-hand and 200 units in-transit (ordered P18, P19). The orders from P18 (144 units) and P19 (56 units) are expected to arrive in P22 and P23 respectively. Given the observed volatility and the service level requirement (Profit $4 / Holding $1 = 80% target quantile), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture the summer regime shift beginning at P15. This N covers the high-demand spikes and the brief low-demand period, providing a balanced forecast for the OR engine while account for the 4-period lead time pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Womens waist belt) is currently in a summer demand regime (starting P15). Demand has shown high volatility but remains elevated compared to the spring low. Recent demand (P21: 76, P22: 83) suggests a secondary peak in July, contrasting with the lower demand seen in late June. Over the last 8 periods (P15-P22), the average demand is 58.5 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all observed arrivals (P20-P22). Current inventory status: On-hand (145) + In-transit (112) = 257 units. This total covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current average (58.5). Since lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the summer regime's volatility and higher mean without being overly skewed by the initial P15 spike of 105. This strategy maintains a healthy pipeline to prevent summer stockouts while respecting the OR backend's safety stock logic.

Carry-over insight: July demand rebound: Periods 21-22 show sustained high demand (avg ~80) after a brief mid-summer dip (P17-P20 avg ~26). Summer regime average from P15-P22 is approximately 58 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Bella waistbelt has entered a robust summer peak. Over the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has been consistently high (76, 83, 63, averaging ~74), confirming the 'July rebound' identified in previous insights. The current date is July 22, suggesting we are in the middle of the summer peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly reliable (confirmed by arrivals for orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19). Currently, we have 138 units on hand and 154 in transit (orders from P22, P23). Total pipeline inventory is 292. We need to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 periods). Given the recent trend, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the full summer regime (starting P15) while smoothing out the extreme volatility seen in June (P17-P20). This balances the high July sales against the lower June dips to avoid over-ordering as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained: July demand (P21-P23) averaged 74 units/period, significantly higher than the early-summer average (P15-P20) of 50 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/29. We are in a high-demand summer regime that began around Period 21. Demand over the last 4 weeks (P21-P24) has been 76, 83, 63, and 76, resulting in an average of 74.5 units per period. This is significantly higher than the early 'summer' instability seen between P15-P20. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P20, P21, P22, and P23). On-hand inventory is currently 62, and pipeline inventory is 216 (orders from P22, P23, P24), totaling 278 units of cover. To maintain this high service level during the summer peak, I set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the stable 74+ demand level, and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. L remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: July high-demand regime confirmed stable (avg ~75 units/period over P21-P24). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/05. Demand has entered a high-activity summer regime starting around Period 21, currently averaging approximately 70 units per period (P21-P25 average is 69.8). Although Period 25 saw a slight dip to 51, the overall July/August trend for this 'Wide waist belt' remains strong. On-hand inventory is very low at 11 units, but there is a significant pipeline of 305 units across the next 4 periods. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P22 and P23 conclude messages). Looking ahead, August typically represents the tail end of summer accessories demand; however, since stockouts occurred recently (P17-P19), I will maintain a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5 from P21-P25) to capture the current high-demand regime while the OR engine manages the large pipeline. Setting L=4 (promised) and using N=5 for demand statistics effectively targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for recent high volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Bella waistbelt' is currently in a sustained summer high-demand regime. Analyzing recent history: P21-P26 average demand is approximately 68 units per period (76, 83, 63, 76, 51, 61). This level is significantly higher than the spring lull but slightly lower than the mid-July peak of ~75. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent 'conclude' messages (P20-P23 and P26 arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), but there is substantial pipeline inventory (307 units). Total pipeline + on-hand (313 units) covers significantly more than the (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (~68 * 5 = 340). However, reflecting the recent stabilizing trend around 65-70 units, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current regime more accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N for both aligns the backend with the high-demand summer volatility while preventing over-ordering as we move through mid-August.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: High-demand summer regime remains sustained with an average of ~68 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), following the July peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/8/19), approaching the end of the summer season. Demand for this waist belt has been in a high-demand summer regime since Period 21, averaging approximately 68 units over the last 7 periods (P21-P27). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 40 units on-hand and an expected demand around 64-70 units per period, the safety buffer relies on the 261 units currently in-transit. An order placed in Period 24 (62 units) is expected to arrive next period (P29 conclude), providing 102 units total to cover P29 demand. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent. To forecast demand, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime observed since July, which prevents over-reactive ordering as we potentially transition out of summer while ensuring enough stock to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26, heading into late August. Historical demand from P21-P28 shows a sustained high-demand summer regime averaging approximately 71 units per period (76, 83, 63, 76, 51, 61, 64, 86). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods per concluded messages. Currently, on-hand inventory is 16 units, with 258 units in-transit. Since demand has stabilized at this higher level since early July, I am using a recent_N average for mu_hat with N=8 (covering P21-P28) to capture this specific regime. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 355 units). With 274 units of inventory already accounted for (16 on-hand + 258 in-transit), the OR backend will place an order to reach the target service level while managing the holding cost of $1/unit/period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P21-P28) confirmed stable at an average of ~71 units per period, showing higher consistency than the early summer volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. The summer high-demand regime (starting around P21) remains consistent, with an average demand of approximately 71 units per period over the last 9 periods (P21-P29). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods across all arrivals. Recent demand (P28: 86, P29: 83) suggests the peak remains stable as we transition into September. Given the current on-hand inventory of 22 and in-transit inventory of 259, total pipeline is 281. Using a base-stock approach with N=9 captures the current regime effectively (\u03bc \u2248 71/period). Total expected lead time plus review period (1+L) is 5. mu_hat for this window is approximately 355. Since in-transit + on-hand is 281, and the OR backend uses a capped policy, I will keep the settings stable to maintain service levels through the end of the season.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Summer demand regime (P21-P29) continues to hold steady at an average of ~71 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July. For the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 74.1 units, with the most recent period (P30) showing a peak of 98. On-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout in P30. Although 293 units are in-transit, we must ensure these are sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Using the recent 10-period average (approx. 74) results in a mu_hat of ~370. The backend OR engine will calculate the order size based on this 5-period requirement minus the pipeline. Given the stockout and the high demand of 98 in P30, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable summer-into-autumn demand level while smoothing out the single P30 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Stockout occurred in Period 30 (Demand 98 vs 80 available). Demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) has averaged 74.1 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime through summer and into early September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began around P21, coinciding with the summer to early autumn season. Over the last 11 periods (P21-P31), the average demand is 74.3 units. Recent periods (P30-P31) have seen demand spikes up to 98 units, resulting in back-to-back stockouts (ending on-hand inventory is 0). Although there are 339 units in-transit, the immediate availability is zero, and we must ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1=5). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 11 periods to capture this sustained high-demand level accurately (Average ~74.3 * 5 = 371.5). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same period to account for recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period X conclude' arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P21 to P31 is 74.3 units per period (approx +210% vs. low-regime avg of 24). Current stockouts (P30-P31) indicate demand may exceed available supply during this peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Bella waistbelt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in late June/early July (approx. P21). From P21 to P32, demand has averaged approximately 74.4 units per period. Recently, the system has experienced consecutive stockouts (P30-P32) because demand (avg 82 in the last 3 periods) has exceeded the arriving shipments and starting on-hand inventory. The current date is September 23, and demand remains strong. Although we are entering autumn, there is no statistical evidence yet of a downward shift from the summer peak; in fact, the last 4 periods (P29-P32) show a mean demand of 82.5 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the most recent 12 periods (P21-P32) to capture this sustained high-demand regime (N=12), ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient to break the current stockout cycle. Pipeline inventory is high (337 units), but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain orders to prevent future gaps.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains high: Average demand from P29-P32 increased to 82.5 units per period, compared to the P21-P28 average of 70.4. Stockouts have occurred in P30, P31, and P32 due to insufficient on-hand buffer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in mid-July (P21) and has intensified through September. Demand over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) has averaged 97.25 units, significantly higher than the previous P21-P29 average of ~71 units. A major spike occurred in P33 (142 units), leading to a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 305 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now will arrive in P38. Analysis of the dairy-like demand pattern for this accessory (waist belt) suggests a late-summer/early-fall peak. To address current stockouts and the higher demand baseline, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 13 periods (P21-P33) which represent the consistent high-demand summer/fall regime (avg 78.4). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture the increased volatility (std \u2248 26) seen during this period compared to the very stable spring/early-summer low regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration confirmed: Average demand from P30-P33 rose to 97.3 units/period, compared to the P21-P29 average of 71.0 (+37% increase). Stockouts have persisted for 4 consecutive periods (P30-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that accelerated in September (P30-P33 avg: 97.3 units), though P34 showed a slight dip to 83 units. Stockouts occurred in Periods 30-33 because the OR backend's inventory targets (base stock) have been trailing the rapid demand growth. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is low (9 units), but pipeline inventory is robust (330 units). To resolve the stockout trend and account for the recent demand acceleration, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering P29-P34) to capture the higher September mean (~90 units/period) without over-reacting to the P33 spike of 142. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the increased volatility (P33 spike vs P34 dip). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods based on game history.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration confirmed: Average demand from P29-P34 is 89.2 units/period, significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~71 units. Stockouts occurred P30-P33 due to supply lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bella waistbelt has shifted into a higher-velocity regime in September and October. While mid-summer (P21-P29) averaged ~71 units/period, the last 6 periods (P30-P35) have averaged 91 units/period, despite some lost sales due to stockouts. This indicates a seasonal peak likely tied to autumn fashion transitions. In Period 36, on-hand inventory is low (33), but total in-transit is high (367), including the large corrective orders from P34 (117) and P35 (135). Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high Pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the P29-P35 shift) to capture the higher mean of ~90 units/period (total mu_hat = (4+1)*90 = 450). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent window to reflect the higher volatility observed during this peak season. The OR backend will subtract the 367 in-transit units from the base stock calculated with these parameters.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed: Period 30-35 average demand is 91 units/period, a ~28% increase over the summer average of 71 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Womens waist belt) is currently in an October high-demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 91 units per period since Period 30. There was a significant spike in Period 33 (142 units) and recent demand has stabilized between 74 and 84 units. On-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) due to preceding stockouts in September (Periods 30-33). Although lead time is stable at 4 periods, the current in-transit pipeline (406 units) is substantial, reflecting orders placed during the high-demand surge. To ensure a high service level while managing the incoming pipeline, I am setting L=4 (promised) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 30-36) to capture the higher October average (~92 units/period, or 460 for L+1). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the need to replenish stock after recent stockouts with the risk of over-ordering as the season potentially transitions.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 589748001 is currently in a high-demand October regime, averaging approximately 90-100 units per period. Period 37 saw a demand of 108 units, resulting in a stockout since on-hand inventory was only 64. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, we must rely on the incoming in-transit pipeline (433 units) which includes orders from P34 (117), P35 (135), P36 (96), and P37 (85). To prevent future stockouts and capture the current demand trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the start of the September/October acceleration from P30 onwards). This averages approximately 92.1 units per period. The OR backend will use this to calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the high volatility observed during these spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: October demand acceleration persists with an average of ~92 units per period (P30-P37). Continuous stockouts in P30-P33 and P37 highlight that demand often exceeds current arrival rates, requiring a higher base stock buffer.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) shows a sustained high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P30-P38), average demand is approximately 99.2 units per period, with significant volatility (highs of 142/115, lows of 74). The 'conclude' message from P38 shows demand was 115, leaving only 2 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. Because demand has accelerated since the mid-summer period (previously ~71), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 9 periods (P30-P38) to capture this 'October-November' peak regime. This ensures the base stock (covering 1+4 periods) is calculated against ~100 units/period rather than including lower summer data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to account for high volatility (std dev is ~22 in this window), providing a necessary buffer to prevent the stockouts observed in P30-P33 and P37.

Carry-over insight: November transition: Demand from P30-P38 has stabilized at a higher average of ~99 units/period (approx +40% over the P21-P29 summer average of 71). High volatility persists with a standard deviation of ~22.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/11. Demand analysis indicates a sustained high regime that began in September (Period 30). Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged 96.6 units per period, with significant volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 21.5). Frequent stockouts (P30-P33, P37) confirm that the delivery of ~71 units/period (based on summer orders) was insufficient for this autumn peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To ensure high service levels during this period and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility. This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean (approx 97 units) and the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P30-P39 is 96.6 units per period (+36% over summer avg of 71). Demand volatility remains high (StdDev ~21).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18, 2019. We are in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 30 (September). The average demand from Period 30 to Period 40 is approximately 96 units per period, showing significant growth compared to the summer average of 71. The last 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average demand of 96.8, confirming the stability of this higher autumn/winter level. Stockouts occurred frequently until recently when arrival volumes finally caught up with the shift. On-hand inventory is currently 56 units, with 365 units in transit (expected arrivals of 85, 73, 127, and 80 over the next 4 periods). As the game enters its final stages (Period 41/47), maintaining a high service level is critical to capture the remaining demand. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the P30 shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime's higher mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Womens wide waist belt) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime. Period 42 starts on 2019-11-25, which is moving into the peak holiday shopping season. Demand over the last 12 periods (P30-P41) has averaged 94.6 units per period, representing a significant sustaining of the autumn spike. While the most recent demand in P41 (68 units) was lower, the autumn average remains consistently high (~95) compared to the summer average (~71). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods across the entire history. Pipeline inventory is healthy (367 units in-transit), and on-hand inventory (73 units) is at its highest in several periods, reducing stockout risk. To maintain optimal service levels through the holiday season while accounting for recent consistent high demand and high volatility (StdDev ~22), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this autumn regime (P30-P41). This allows the OR backend to target a base-stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Holiday demand regime confirmed (P30-P41): Average demand is ~95 units/period (+221% vs. year-start low, +33% vs. summer avg). High volatility (StdDev ~22) persists into late November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bella waistbelt peaked sharply in Period 42 (187 units), likely signaling the start of the December holiday shopping season (Date: 2019/12/2). This is a significant jump from the previous Autumn regime average of ~95. The current situation shows 0 on-hand inventory due to this spike. To prevent stockouts during this high-volume period, I am increasing the demand forecast. Based on the jump from 68 to 187, and considering typical retail seasonality for accessories in December, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that anticipates sustained high demand (~130 units/period) across the lead-time horizon (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is increased to capture the high volatility seen in recent stockout periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: December holiday peak confirmed with Period 42 demand reaching 187 units (+100% over the Autumn average). This marks a transition from the Autumn regime (~95 units) to a Holiday regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak December holiday season (Period 44, Dec 9). The previous period (P42) showed a massive demand spike to 187 units, followed by a lower demand of 67 in P43, likely dampened by inventory constraints or specific shopping rhythms. Total demand for the Autumn/Holiday regime (P30-P43) averages 97.7 units per period with a high standard deviation (approx 34), largely driven by the P42 spike. For the current decision (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the current on-hand (60) and lead time, we need a high base stock to prevent further stockouts seen in P42. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=14, covering the Autumn/Holiday regime) which captures the average of ~98, and sigma_hat explicitly at 45 to account for extreme volatility seen in holiday peaks. This ensures the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Peak holiday demand confirmed with extreme volatility (P42 spike of 187). Autumn/Holiday regime (P30-P43) average demand is 97.7 units/period with StdDev ~34.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (P45, Date: 2019/12/16). Demand has transitioned from an Autumn average of ~95 units (P30-P41) to a higher-volatility Holiday regime. Period 42 saw a significant spike to 187 units, while the subsequent periods (P43-P44) have averaged 78.5 units. The high demand from P42 resulted in a stockout, confirming that we must account for high variance during this season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the rest of the holiday month while being mindful of the game end to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat (P30-P44) to capture the elevated Autumn/Holiday average (~100 units/period) and recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to capture the holiday-driven volatility (StdDev ~34). This balances the need for a high service level against the inventory currently in-transit (381 units).

Carry-over insight: Holiday regime (P42-P44) shows extreme volatility with a single-period peak of 187 units and an average demand of ~115 units since the start of December (P42-P44).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday regime (late December). The demand context is characterized by extreme volatility (observed peak of 187 in Period 42) and a significant step-up in mean demand. The average demand for the 'Autumn/Holiday' regime (P30-P45) is approximately 95 units, but the last 4 periods (December) specifically show an average of roughly 105 units with high variance. Given the date (Dec 23), we must anticipate high demand for the current and coming weeks. On-hand inventory is low (61), and while in-transit is high (405), we must ensure base stock is set high enough to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the full high-demand regime since late September, which averages ~100 units/period (total 500 for the horizon). Sigma_hat is set using the same window (N=15) to account for the heightened volatility (StdDev ~34). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) average demand approximately 105 units, continuing the high-demand trend starting P30 (avg ~96). High volatility persists with significant spikes (187 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30th, the final week of the year. Demand historically peaks in December (P42 demand was 187, average P42-P46 is ~96). However, there is typically a post-holiday demand drop as the winter season ends and retail moves into January. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units, with a substantial pipeline of 416 units. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the likely decrease in demand following the holiday peak, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (approx P32-P46) to capture the higher late-year demand regime while allowing the OR engine to buffer against volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (15) to account for the significant variance observed during the holiday spikes (e.g., P42). No aggressive increase is needed given the large pipeline entering a traditionally slower retail period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition: High-demand regime (P30-P46) averaged ~96 units, but history suggests a potential drop in January demand. Pipeline (416 units) is high relative to current on-hand (60).
