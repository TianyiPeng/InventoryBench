Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Strap top', categorized as 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Given the historical data provided (5 weeks), mean demand is 134 units with a standard deviation of 18.9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). The target service level (q) is profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. However, the OR backend's inventory policy will manage this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent patterns from provided historical data, and 'default' for lead time (4 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. In Period 1, we ordered 166 units, but since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we did not expect arrivals yet. We started with 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in 157 lost sales. The historical demand (5 samples) shows a mean of 142 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2. There are no clear seasonal shifts yet in the early February data, but we must ensure the 'base stock' covers L+1 periods (5 weeks) of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available historical samples (N=5) to capture the recent mean of 142 and variance. The OR backend will calculate the order to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' strap top. Historical demand data shows a mean of ~134 units, but Period 1 and 2 actual demand was 157 and 244 respectively, indicating a significant upward trend or seasonal shift as we move further into February/Spring. Inventory is currently 0 because our initial orders (Period 1 and 2) are in-transit; with a promised lead time of 4, we don't expect them to arrive until Periods 5 and 6 respectively. We have lost all sales so far due to being stocked out. Given the jump to 244 units of demand in the most recent period, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (incorporating the last 2 observed periods + the most recent pre-game sample) to capture this higher demand regime. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the engine to adapt to actual arrival observations once they occur.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 134 units/week. Since the simulation started, demand has been higher (avg 192), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in-transit (Total 608), which is expected as P1's order is only due to arrive in P5 (P1+4). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend must account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the recent upward shift (avg 192) compared to the Jan samples, setting N=3 for the simulation periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a drift from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The item is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand history shows samples: 162, 142, 115, 133, 118 (pre-game) and 157, 244, 175, 149 (Period 1-4). Average demand is approximately 160. Promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6 start). We are currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) because lead time has not yet elapsed. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Mu_hat calculations focus on the 5-week window (L+1=5). Since there is no clear trend or seasonal spike detected yet in March for this basic item, I will use a 5-period average for demand forecasting.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics strap top', which typically sees steady demand with potential upticks as spring progresses. Analysis of Period 5 conclude confirms the first order (Period 1) arrived with a lead time of 4 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is currently low (28) but we have a large pipeline in-transit (710 units) from orders in P2, P3, and P4. Demand samples (including pre-game history: 162, 142, 115, 133, 118 and in-game: 157, 244, 175, 149, 138) show a mean of approximately 153.3 units per period. The spike in Period 2 (244) appears to be an outlier or early seasonality, as subsequent weeks returned to the 130-175 range. To balance holding costs ($1) against profit ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent and relevant in-game demand trends (averaging ~182 when including the P2 spike, but the backend handles the math). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the first shipment confirmed the promised 4-period duration. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Observed demand for the last 5 weeks has been [244, 175, 149, 138, 156], with an average of 172.4. The spike in Period 2 (244) appears to be an outlier or early-season volatility. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Currently, we have 34 units on hand and 673 units in transit (ordered in P3, P4, and P6). The OR backend uses the formula (1+L) * mu to set base stock. Given L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (including the seed data) provides a robust mean. I will use the 'calculate' method for L since it matches the promised lead time, 'default' for mu_hat to capture the full sample mean (approx 153 * 5 = 765), and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a standard safety stock buffer.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' Strap Top. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been stable, averaging approximately 154 units per period across 12 samples (Samples: 162, 142, 115, 133, 118; Periods 1-7: 157, 244, 175, 149, 138, 156, 182). Period 2 saw an outlier (244), but demand remains generally consistent. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 454 (Orders from P4=268, P6=125, P7=61), which covers approximately 3 periods of average demand at the 154 rate. Given the 'Everyday Basics' category and the approach of spring/summer, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full range of recent demand and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed stability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods across 3 completed cycles.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's strap top (Everyday Basics), which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Reviewing demand history: P5-P7 were relatively stable (138, 156, 182), but Period 8 showed a significant spike to 312 (+71% vs P7). This aligns with the transition to warmer weather in April. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P5-P8 arrival data), matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 88, with 380 in transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To calculate parameters, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend starting in March, but use a conservative sigma_hat to account for the sudden volatility seen in P8. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 8: weekly demand spiked from ~160 to 312 (+95% over the prior 4-week average), likely due to seasonal demand for women's summer basics.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. A significant demand spike occurred in Period 8 (312 units), followed by Period 9 (207 units), representing a shift from the previous average of ~160 to ~260. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 707 units in-transit. The Period 5 order (if any) was 0, explaining why no arrival occurred in Period 9 (lead time is confirmed as 4). The next arrival is expected in Period 10 (from Period 6 order of 125 units), which will still leave us stock-out constrained given the current demand regime. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as it matches observed performance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (Periods 7, 8, 9: 182, 312, 207; avg ~233), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility in this new seasonal regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P5-P8 and P10). The item is a 'Strap top', categorized as 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand has shown a shift: Periods 1-7 averaged 174 units, while Periods 8-10 averaged 248 units (+42%), peaking at 312 in P8. This correlates with the spring season approaching summer. In Period 10, we stocked out (ending inventory 0) because the P5 order (which would have arrived) was 0 units. We currently have 0 on-hand but 930 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). This pipeline is significant but necessary to cover the observed demand spike and lead time of 4. Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the recent higher demand regime (avg 248), resulting in a forecast of 1240 for the 5-period window. Sigma will use default to account for the overall volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late April (2019/4/29), approaching the peak summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (strap tops). Demand since Period 8 has remained high, averaging approximately 254 units (312, 207, 225, 273), confirming the regime shift noted in Period 9. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1,179 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The arrivals in Periods 10 and 11 were delayed or smaller due to low ordering in Periods 6 and 7 (following high on-hand levels then), leading to stockouts. To recover and prepare for sustained summer demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (post-shift). Given the stockouts, actual demand may be slightly higher than sold units, but 'sold' is capped by demand; since we sold all available units in Periods 9-11 and demand was higher, we must use the demand figures for forecasting. Average demand over N=4 is (312+207+225+273)/4 = 254.25. (1+L) * 254.25 = 1271.25. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new mean while acknowledging the increased volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product (Strap top/Vest top) is entering its peak summer season. A significant demand regime shift was previously identified starting in Period 8, with recent demand averaging ~257 units (Periods 8-12: 312, 207, 225, 273, 270), compared to the earlier ~160 average. Since Period 9, the system has consistently stocked out (on-hand 0), meaning 'Sold' figures are constrained by supply; the true latent demand is likely equal to or higher than the observed demand. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out for 4 consecutive periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher summer demand regime, and using 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for higher volatility during this high-demand phase to ensure the OR backend orders enough to rebuild safety stock. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods align with observations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockouts observed from Period 9 to 12; recent demand regime (avg 257) remains nearly double the pre-Period 8 levels due to summer seasonality for strap tops.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May), dealing with a high-demand seasonal 'Strap top'. Since Period 8, demand has established a higher regime (averaging ~248 units/week vs. ~160 earlier), coinciding with warmer spring/summer weather. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. While we recovered from a series of stockouts in Period 13 due to the arrival of the Period 9 order (327 units), on-hand inventory is only 128. Demand in Period 13 was 199. I will use the recent 6 periods (Period 8-13) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 4-period lead time. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained seasonal demand shift while maintaining a buffer for volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (late May). The product is a 'Strap top', categorized under 'Womens Everyday Basics', which is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand surge as summer approaches. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 8; the average weekly demand from Period 8 to Period 14 is approximately 250 units (312, 207, 225, 273, 270, 199, 266), compared to the earlier baseline of ~160. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as evidenced by latest arrivals from Periods 9 and 10 arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 210, and we have a large pipeline of 763 units. Given the high demand and the high risk of stockouts seen in Periods 9-12, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this higher summer regime. I will use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility in this higher-volume period. L will be kept at 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a 'Strap top', which is experiencing strong late-spring/early-summer seasonal demand. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 8. In the most recent 8 periods (Periods 8-15), demand has averaged 252.3 units per week, significantly higher than the initial weeks. Although there were several weeks of stockouts (Periods 9-12), the supply chain has stabilized with the promised lead time of 4 periods consistently holding true (confirmed by arrivals in P13, P14, and P15). Currently, we have 253 units on-hand and 732 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). The next arrival expected during Period 16 is the order from Period 12 (93 units). I will continue to use N=8 for demand forecasting to capture the current high-demand summer regime while smoothing out the volatility observed since the April spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3rd), we are in the peak summer season for women's strap tops. Demand has stabilized at a high-level regime (~258 units/week) since Period 8, contrasted with the spring average (~150 units). Recent demands (P13-P16) are 199, 266, 267, and 263, showing high consistency. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 83 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~260, we expect another stockout in Period 17 before the P13 order (209 units) arrives in Period 18. Given the profit ($1) equals the holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, because the pipeline must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand to avoid future stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 weeks of demand (P12-P16) to capture this summer plateau accurately. This ensures the base stock is high enough to handle the sustained seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak plateau confirmed through May: Demand averages 258 units per week (Period 13-Period 16), maintaining the +60-70% increase over spring baselines.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), we are firmly in the summer season for 'Strap tops', which serves as an everyday basic but peaks during warmer months. Since the demand regime shift at Period 8, demand has stabilized at a high plateau. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 241.4 units (199, 266, 267, 263, 212). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17 (17 - 13 = 4). With on-hand inventory at 80 and a robust pipeline of 973 units, we must ensure the parameters prevent both stockouts and excessive holding costs. I will set L to 'default' (4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current plateau (forecasted demand for the review + lead period = (1+4) * 241.4 = 1207), and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, representing mid-summer. The product is a 'Strap top', which is highly seasonal. Historically, demand spiked at Period 8 (~312 units) and maintained a plateau around 250-260 units until Period 18, where a sharp decline to 92 units was observed. This demand drop (92 units) is significant, representing a ~65% decrease from the previous 4-week average. Since seasonal peaks for basic apparel often taper off after mid-June, I am reacting to this as a potential regime shift toward late-summer/post-peak demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging ~189 units) to balance the high previous weeks with the recent low observation, preventing massive overstocking while respecting that demand might not stay as low as 92. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Potential demand regime shift/post-peak decline detected. Weekly demand dropped from ~240 average to 92 (-62%), signaling the end of the summer peak for strap tops.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are managing a 'Strap top', a seasonal summer basic. History shows a clear demand regime shift: after a high-demand period peaking in April/May (~250-300 units/week), demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (Period 18: 92, Period 19: 85). This confirms the end of the summer peak as observed in the carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is high (697 units) compared to this new lower demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs during this post-peak phase, I am updating mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the sharp decline, and setting sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the current lower volatility. This will allow the OR backend to scale down orders and burn through the current on-hand and in-transit surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: weekly demand dropped from ~250 to ~88 average (-65%) starting Period 18, signaling the end of the summer season for strap tops.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics Strap Top) has entered a clear post-peak demand regime as of July 1st. Summer seasonality has peaked, with demand dropping from a ~250 units/week plateau (Periods 13-17) to a significantly lower average of ~79 units/week over the last three periods (P18: 92, P19: 85, P20: 61). Current on-hand inventory (549) plus in-transit stock (420) totals 969 units, which is far in excess of the needs for the newly observed demand regime (covering approximately 12 weeks of demand at the current rate). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to quickly adjust the 'base_stock' target downwards to reflect the lower demand, preventing further overstocking and minimizing holding costs as the season ends. No order is expected to be triggered given the high pipeline inventory relative to the new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-761.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Strap top) is in a confirmed post-peak demand regime following the end of the summer season (2019/7/8). Demand has dropped significantly from a peak of ~250 to an average of ~66 units over the last four periods (92, 85, 61, 27). The most recent period (P21) showed exceptionally low demand (27). Inventory levels are currently very high at 788 units on-hand plus 154 in-transit, totaling 942 units. Given the new demand mean, this inventory covers approximately 14 weeks of demand, far exceeding the 5-week target (L+1). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand settles into its low-season baseline, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the sharp decline since Period 18. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decline continues: demand dropped to 27 units in Period 21. Current trajectory suggests a baseline significantly lower than the ~88 average initially estimated at the start of the post-peak phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Strap top/Womens Everyday Basics) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as the summer peak has ended. Demand has plummeted from a weekly average of ~250 units in Phase 2 (summer peak) to a current trailing average of approximately 44 units over the last 5 periods (92, 85, 61, 27, 21), with the most recent two periods dropping significantly further to 27 and 21 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 921 units with zero in-transit, while holding costs equal profit ($1.0/unit). This high inventory level, combined with the forecasted low demand (estimated around 20-30 units per week), means the current stock is sufficient for over 30 weeks. To prevent further accumulation of costly excess inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (Period 21-22) and keeping lead time at the established 4 periods. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory vastly exceeds the required base stock and will correctly output zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand has entered a 'Season End' floor, dropping to ~24 units/week (avg of P21-P22), which is significantly lower than the initial post-peak estimate of ~88.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '108775044' (Strap top) is now in a confirmed post-seasonal decline as we move deeper into July. Recent demand data (P21: 27, P22: 21, P23: 19) indicates a 'Season End' floor, significantly lower than the early summer average. We are currently in an overstock position with 902 units on-hand and zero units in-transit, which far exceeds any reasonable demand forecast for the (L+1) horizon. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will naturally stop ordering as long as (on-hand + in-transit) > base_stock. To align with this low-demand phase and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P21-P23), which captures the new floor of ~22 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a strap top (summer basic), has reached its 'Season End' floor. Demand has plummeted from a summer peak average of ~250 units to a very low baseline. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has been 27, 21, 19, and 18 respectively, averaging approximately 21 units per week. The inventory position is currently 884 units on-hand with zero in-transit. This inventory is far in excess of the current demand trajectory (approx. 42 weeks of supply at current rates). Given that the holding cost equals the profit margin ($1.00), minimizing further orders is essential to mitigate losses from excess stock. I will set the parameters to reflect this new low-demand regime, using the last 4 periods to define the floor and keeping the order quantity at zero to allow the on-hand surplus to deplete.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand floor for season-end confirmed at ~21 units/week (based on P21-P24), down from peak summer levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap Top) is now in a confirmed post-seasonal trough as of early August. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline, averaging approximately 22 units per week over the last five periods (P21: 27, P22: 21, P23: 19, P24: 18, P25: 27). There is currently a very high on-hand inventory of 857 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any new order would take 4 weeks to arrive, and the current stock is sufficient to cover over 38 weeks of demand at the current rate (857 / 22 \u2248 38.9). This excessive inventory poses a high holding cost risk ($1.0/unit/period). To prevent further accumulation, I will maintain the base stock level low by using a small N for mu_hat based on the current floor regime. The OR backend's capped policy will result in zero orders because pipeline inventory (857) far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap Top) is in its 'Season End' floor phase. Current demand is extremely low, averaging 20.2 units/week over the last 5 periods (P22-P26: 21, 19, 18, 27, 16). On-hand inventory is 841 units, which covers approximately 40 weeks of demand at the current rate. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the priority is to avoid any further ordering and liquidate existing stock. No orders have been placed since Period 18, and all in-transit inventory has arrived (the last scheduled arrival from P18 arrived in P22). The OR backend should be configured to prevent ordering; given the high on-hand balance relative to the low demand floor, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 'floor' regime (N=5) will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, ensuring no new orders are triggered.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics strap top) has completed its summer seasonal peak and is now in a clear 'season-end' floor. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level: the last 7 periods (P21-P27) show an average demand of approximately 20 units/week (27, 21, 19, 18, 27, 16, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 829 units with zero pipeline stock. Given the low demand floor, this inventory represents over 40 weeks of supply, which is extremely high relative to the promised lead time of 4. Therefore, no new orders are required. I will set the mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg ~20 * [1+L] = 100) and maintain the lead time at the observed 4 periods. The goal is to maximize profit by avoiding additional holding costs while slowly clearing the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand floor further refined; demand has averaged 18 units/week over the last 4 periods (P24-P27), confirming the end-of-season low.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which has clearly exited its summer peak season. Demand has settled into a 'Season End' floor, with the last 8 periods (P21-P28) showing a significant decline: 27, 21, 19, 18, 27, 16, 12, 11 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is 16.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is very high at 818 units with zero in-transit, providing enough stock for approximately 49 weeks at current demand levels. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), it is critical to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs. I will set the lead time to its observed value (4) and use the most recent 4 periods to define the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock calculation remains well below current on-hand levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top/Vest top) has fully exited its summer peak season. Demand from Period 21 to Period 29 has consistently declined, reaching single-digit levels (7 units in P29). Current on-hand inventory is 811 units, which is extremely high (approximately 80+ weeks of supply) given the current demand floor of ~11 units/week (average of the last 4 periods). With a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1, there is no incentive to hold excess stock. I will continue to set orders to zero by maintaining a low base stock. For mu_hat, I am using N=12 to allow the backend to incorporate the full post-peak decline while remaining anchored to the current low-demand reality. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels are massively reduced.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand floor has effectively reached a minimum of <10 units/week as the product (summer vest top) enters the off-season/September period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap Top) is now in its off-season phase as of September 9th. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 8 units per week over the last four periods (P27-P30). Inventory on hand (805 units) is extremely high relative to this current demand floor, providing hundreds of weeks of cover based on current consumption rates. No new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current low-demand environment. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the significant shift to the off-season floor and avoids placing unnecessary orders that would only increment holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand floor for off-season confirmed at ~8 units/week (based on P27-P30), following the end of the summer season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top) is a 'Summer Basic' and has entered its off-season phase as of mid-September. Demand has consistently decelerated from its summer peak (~250 units) to a current floor of <10 units per week. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), demand was 11, 7, 6, and 4 units respectively, averaging approximately 7 units per week. The inventory on-hand is currently 801 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high (over 100 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate). To maximize the reward function $R_t$, the priority is to avoid any further ordering and minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) captures this off-season floor, ensuring the OR backend sees a very low base stock target, thereby preventing new orders and allowing the existing inventory to slowly clear.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Off-season demand floor narrowed further to ~7 units/week (based on P28-P31) as the product enters the autumn calendar period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (SKU 108775044, a summer strap top) is now in the deep off-season (Late September). Demand has continued its terminal decline, dropping to just 3 units in Period 32. Since Period 30, demand has consistently been <10 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 798 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high (equivalent to over 100 weeks of current demand). The primary goal is to avoid any further replenishment while the system burns through this excess stock. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) to capture this low-demand floor (~6 units average) and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the historical stability of 4 periods. The OR backend will naturally order zero because on-hand (798) far exceeds the base stock level calculated from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Off-season demand has reached a near-zero floor (average ~4.3 units/week over P30-P32) as of late September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap Top/Womens Everyday Basic) has entered the deep off-season as of Period 34 (September 30). Demand has stabilized at a near-zero floor, averaging ~3.3 units/week over the last three periods (P31-P33). We are currently in an overstock position with 795 units on-hand and zero units in transit. Given that the weekly holding cost ($1.00) equals the unit profit, and the demand floor is extremely low, there is no justification for further ordering. The inventory on-hand is sufficient to cover several years of demand at current rates. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to reflect the current off-season mean of ~4 units per week, which will result in a base stock level far below my current on-hand inventory, effectively halting all replenishment orders to minimize further holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a summer 'Strap top', has fully transitioned into its off-season phase as of October 7th. Demand has established a near-zero floor, averaging ~4.5 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). Current on-hand inventory is 788 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high (approximately 175 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), minimizing further inventory is critical to prevent profit erosion from holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, but given the massive overstock, no orders will be triggered by the OR backend. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect the off-season floor and ensure the base stock calculation remains low, preventing any accidental orders as the inventory slowly depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Off-season demand floor narrowed to ~4.5 units/week (based on P30-P34) as the product remains in a late-autumn baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top) is a seasonal summer item currently in its off-season (October). Demand has reached a stable 'floor' of approximately 4-5 units per week based on the last 5 periods (P31-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 785 units, which is extremely high (nearly 200 weeks of cover at current demand rates). There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the unit profit ($1.0/unit) and the excessive stock, the primary objective is to stop ordering and allow inventory to deplete. The parameters are set to reflect the current off-season mean (~4.4 units) to ensure the base stock calculation remains significantly lower than the current inventory, preventing any further orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (a summer strap top) is currently in its off-season phase as of mid-October (Period 37). Demand has stabilized at a near-zero floor, with the recent 5-period average (P32-P36) being approximately 4.2 units per week. The inventory level is extremely high (780 units on-hand) relative to this demand, resulting in significant holding costs. No further orders are required. To prevent any automated ordering by the backend OR engine, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect the current off-season regime (1+L = 5 periods). L remains at the observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Off-season demand floor confirmed at ~4 units/week (based on P32-P36) as the product moves deeper into the autumn/winter calendar.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top) is a seasonal summer item now deep in its off-season (Late October). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high (777 units) compared to the current demand floor of approximately 4 units per week. No additional orders are required for the remainder of the game. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the current off-season baseline (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR backend keeps the order quantity at zero, as the current pipeline and on-hand inventory vastly exceed the required base stock for this demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a summer basic that has entered its off-season phase as of November (Period 39). Demand has remained consistently low since Period 30, averaging approximately 4.8 units per week over the last 9 periods (P30-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 769 units, which is extremely high (equivalent to over 150 weeks of current demand) given the low sales volume. There are no units in-transit. The primary objective is to avoid any further accumulation of inventory and minimize holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), and we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime. I will set the lead time to its observed value of 4, and use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the stable off-season floor (~5 units/week). No new orders will be triggered by the OR engine because the pipeline inventory (769) far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Strap Top) is currently in a deep off-season phase (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low floor, averaging approximately 5.4 units per week over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) and only 5 units per week over the last 3 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 765 units, which is extremely high relative to this demand level (~140 weeks of supply). With a holding cost of $1.0/unit and no remaining in-transit units, the objective is to prevent further ordering and harvest profit while minimizing additional holding costs. I am setting the lead time to its observed stable value of 4 and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime to accurately reflect the off-season demand floor. No further ordering will occur given the massive inventory surplus.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top' (summer-centric garment) and the current date is November 18, 2019. We are in the deep off-season floor. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged 4.4 units/week, with the last two periods at exactly 4 units. On-hand inventory is 761 units, which covers over 170 weeks of current demand. At a holding cost of $1.0/unit/period, this excess inventory is heavily penalizing the total reward. No further orders should be placed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current off-season baseline (recent_N=10) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger any new orders while we wait for the game to conclude and inventory to slowly deplete.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap Top) is a summer-seasonal item currently in the deep off-season (Late November). Demand has been extremely low and stable, averaging ~4.5 units per week over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 758 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (total expected demand ~22 units). There is no reason to place further orders. I will set the L to 'calculate' (steady at 4), and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the current off-season floor (~4.5 * 5 = 22.5). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the low volatility of this period. The high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculated from these parameters will correctly result in 0 new units ordered.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a highly seasonal summer item. We are currently in Period 43 (early December), which is the deep off-season for this category. Demand has been extremely low and stable, averaging ~4.5 units per week over the last 10 periods (P33-P42). The current on-hand inventory is 748 units, which is massive compared to the current demand floor (covering over 150 weeks of demand). Since any additional units will only incur significant holding costs (Holding Cost = $1.0 vs. Profit = $1.0), and the remaining game length is only 4 periods, no further orders should be placed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current off-season baseline to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order against the high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Off-season demand floor remains stable at ~4.5 units/week (based on P33-P42) through early December; inventory levels are extremely high (748 units) relative to remaining game duration.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44/47), which is mid-winter for the 'Strap top'. Demand has remained at a very low off-season floor, averaging approximately 4.5 units per week over the last 11 periods (P33-P43). Specifically, the demand in Period 43 was only 2 units. On-hand inventory is extremely high (746 units), which is more than enough to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (44, 45, 46, 47) given the current demand rate. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), and the game is ending in 4 periods, any additional order would only increase holding costs without providing any benefit. The goal is to minimize ending inventory. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current off-season baseline, but the high on-hand inventory relative to the pipeline will result in the OR backend placing zero orders.

108775044: ordered=0, arrived=0, starting on-hand inventory=746, demand=4, sold=4, ending on-hand inventory=742
Daily Profit: $4.00, Daily Holding Cost: $742.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-738.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, a summer strap top, is in its deep off-season floor with demand averaging approximately 4 units per week over the last 10+ periods. On-hand inventory is 742 units, which is enough to cover current demand for over 180 periods, far exceeding the 47-period game duration. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), any additional order will result in a net loss due to holding costs incurred on units that will not sell before the game ends. Therefore, no additional orders should be placed. I will maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods and keep demand parameters set to reflect the current off-season baseline to prevent the OR backend from triggering any safety-stock-based orders.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). The product is a summer vest top, which is currently in its off-season 'floor' regime. Demand has been extremely low and stable for many months, averaging approximately 4-5 units per week since Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 735 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given that the 'Profit' and 'Holding Cost' are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the target base stock is the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). With demand at ~4.5 units/week and a lead time of 4 periods (L+1 = 5), the target inventory level is roughly 22-25 units. Since on-hand inventory (735) is significantly higher than any foreseeable demand before the game's likely end (Period 47 or shortly thereafter), I will continue to set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed to minimize additional holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 30, 2019 (Period 47), which is the final period of the game. For SKU 108775044 (Strap Top), we are currently in an off-season demand regime with a very low weekly average (~4-6 units). The on-hand inventory is 724 units, which vastly exceeds any possible demand for the remaining duration of the game. Since the goal is to maximize R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, and we already have massive excess stock, any further ordering would only increase the ending inventory and the associated holding costs without increasing sales (as demand is fully covered). Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend places zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand winter regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, triggering zero orders.
