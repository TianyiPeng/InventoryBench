Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we are starting with zero inventory and no history of lead times or arrivals. The product is a 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (women's lingerie). Historical demand for the last five weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows values of 42, 56, 47, 42, and 42. The mean of these historical samples is 45.8 and the standard deviation is 5.97. There is no strong evidence of a major regime shift or Valentine's Day spike yet in the provided 2019-02-04 data, but we are now entering the week of Feb 11th, which is the immediate lead-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). This category (lingerie/bodies) often sees increased demand during this period. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes the full historical set (mean 45.8, std 5.97) and the promised lead time (L=4). This sets a base stock level calculation for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate to capture any potential holiday upside without overcommitting based on limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2 (2019-02-18), we observe the conclusion of Period 1. The starting inventory was 0, an order of 56 units was placed, and demand was 63. No units were sold due to 0 stock, resulting in a stockout. There are currently 56 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 (Mean: 45.8). Period 1 demand (63) is significantly higher than the previous mean, possibly due to Valentine's Day seasonality for lingerie (Feb 14 occurred during Period 1). Since Feb 14 has passed, demand might stabilize or slightly decrease, but we must protect against the current stockout. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including Period 1) to capture the recent mean of ~48.7 units per period. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4). mu_hat will be (1+4)*48.7 = 243.5. sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This SKU is a 'Lace push-up body', part of Women's Lingerie. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged 45.8 units/week. However, recent demand in P1 (63) and P2 (68) shows a significant spike (+45% over baseline). This increase aligns with the pre-Valentine's Day and late February retail period. The 'In-transit' of 120 units matches the orders from P1 (56) and P2 (64). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P1 order to arrive in P5 (visible in the P6 decision phase). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline reflects these pending arrivals. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the starting baseline. Since lead time observation isn't possible until P5 conclude (P6), I use 'default' (4 weeks).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is a 'Lace push-up body', a fashion lingerie item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the history: Period 1 ordered 56, Period 2 ordered 64, and Period 3 ordered 73, totaling 193 units in-transit. Since L=4, the first order (from Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1-3 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand history shows 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 (pre-game) and 63, 68, 28 (in-game). The drop to 28 in Period 3 might be a fluke or a post-Valentine's Day dip, as the product is lingerie. Overall mean demand including pre-game is roughly 46 units/period. With L=4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all available samples is prudent as we lack a clear sustained regime shift despite the recent volatility. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Lace push-up body' lingerie item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, we expect the first shipment (56 units) to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase. Consequently, we should observe 'arrived=56' in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Current on-hand is 0, and total in-transit is 264 units (Sum of orders P1: 56, P2: 64, P3: 73, P4: 71). Historical demand samples (before P1) were around 42-56. Observed demand in P1-P4 was [63, 68, 28, 34]. This suggests a volatile demand pattern, possibly peaking in mid-February (Valentine's Day season) and cooling down in early March. The mean of the 5 pre-game samples is 45.8, while the mean of P1-P4 is 48.25. Given the seasonality of lingerie (post-Valentine's drop), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the lower demand observed in the last two weeks (P3-P4) to prevent overstocking as we move further into March. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent on-game demand more heavily than the initial samples, while still acknowledging the high volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Charlotte Body Push' lingerie item. Historically, we have demand samples: 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 from the pre-game data, and realized demand of 63, 68, 28, 34, 25 in Periods 1-5. There is a clear demand regime shift: Periods 1-2 saw high demand (avg 65.5), likely due to pre-Valentine's Day shopping and the event itself. Periods 3-5 show a significant drop (avg 29), consistent with a post-holiday slump for this category. Promised lead time is 4, and the first order from Period 1 arrived exactly in Period 5 (L=4). We have 260 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), and 31 units on hand. Since lead time is stable at 4, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the lower post-holiday demand (avg ~29) to avoid overstocking. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Valentine's Day (starting Period 3): demand dropped from avg ~65 to avg ~29 (-55%). Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on Period 1 arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25) continues the post-Valentine's Day demand regime. The demand for the last four periods (P3-P6) has been 28, 34, 25, and 30, averaging approximately 29.25 units per period. This is a significant drop from the pre-Valentine's average of ~65 units. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 65, with a pipeline of 196 (orders from P3, P4, P5). These incoming orders will significantly increase inventory levels just as demand has lowered. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand regime (avg ~29) instead of the historical high-demand period, preventing excessive over-ordering by the OR engine.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a lace push-up body (intimate apparel). Historical demand analysis shows a distinct regime shift: Periods 1-2 averaged ~65.5 units (Valentine's peak), while Periods 3-7 have dropped significantly, averaging 29 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (lead times were exactly 4). Current on-hand inventory is 110, with 123 units in-transit (orders from Periods 4 and 5). Total pipeline is 233 units. Given the stable post-Valentine's demand regime (~29 units/week), a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) would be around 145 units. Since 233 > 145, we are currently overstocked and do not need to place additional orders. For the OR parameters, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime since late February and default for lead time as the 4-period promise is being met.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie). Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-2 (pre-Valentine's Day) averaged ~65 units, while Periods 3-8 (post-holiday) have stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 28.3 units (28, 34, 25, 30, 28, 25). The promised lead time of 4 periods is perfectly consistent with observations (Orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly in P5-P8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 156 units, which is significantly high (covering ~5.5 weeks of current demand) due to the large orders placed during the high-demand period arriving now. There is also an in-transit order of 52 units (from P5) arriving next period. Using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the post-holiday regime while providing enough samples for a stable variance estimate. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, well past the Valentine's Day peak (Periods 1-2). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 3, weekly demand has averaged approximately 27 units (28, 34, 25, 30, 28, 25, 19). The 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' lingerie item is showing typical post-peak seasonality. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory of 189 units is very high relative to the current demand (~27 units/week). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1), which would be roughly 135-150 units. Since on-hand (189) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate to avoid further holding costs ($1/unit). I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the post-Valentine's demand mean and variance accurately.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's demand regime (Period 3 onwards) confirmed stable at avg ~27 units (previously ~65).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. We are in a post-Valentine's Day demand regime for this lingerie bodysuit. Demand has consistently decreased since Period 3, falling from an initial average of ~65 to an average of ~26.4 over the last 8 periods (P3-P10). In the most recent four periods, demand has dropped even further (25, 19, 16, 16), suggesting a stabilization at a lower level or a continuing slight downward trend as we move further from the peak seasonal event. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 173 units due to the arrival of orders placed during the high-demand peaks of Periods 1-5. With current demand around 20 units/period and a 4-period lead time, on-hand inventory alone covers over 8 periods of demand. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime using the last 8 periods (N=8) to ensure the OR backend's target stock level aligns with the lower current demand, which will result in no order being placed until inventory levels normalize.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie). Demand history shows a clear regime shift after Period 2 (Valentine's Day season): Periods 1-2 averaged ~65 units, while Periods 3-11 averaged ~25.4 units, with a further slight decline in the most recent periods (avg ~20). On-hand inventory is 149 units with zero units in-transit. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand for the next (L+1=5) periods is expected to be approximately 100-125 units (based on mean ~25). Given the current stock of 149, our inventory already exceeds the total expected demand over the lead time, so the system should not place an order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the post-Valentine's regime (Period 3 onwards) and 'calculate' for lead time as it consistently matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's demand regime (Period 3 onwards) remains stable at a lower average of ~25 units (down from ~65). Cumulative inventory is currently sufficient to cover next 5+ periods of demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical demand for this lace push-up body peaked around Valentine's Day (Periods 1-2, avg ~65) and then dropped into a lower, stable regime (Periods 3-12, avg ~27). Recent demand in Period 12 showed a slight uptick to 47, but the overall trend since late February remains significantly lower than the launch peak. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (observed for orders from Periods 1-5). Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 102 units and 0 in-transit. With an average demand of ~27 units/period, our current stock covers approximately 3.7 periods. Given the backend logic (base_stock calculation vs. pipeline inventory), setting parameters based on the post-Valentine's regime (last 10 periods) remains the most prudent approach to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for occasional spikes like Period 12. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the stabilized demand and volatility of the current regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '487722001' (Charlotte Body Push Melbourne) has stabilized into a lower demand regime following the Valentine's Day peak. Since Period 3 (2019/2/25), weekly demand has averaged approximately 28 units (samples: 28, 34, 25, 30, 28, 25, 19, 16, 24, 47, 28). The spike in Period 12 (47 units) appears to be an outlier or a minor seasonal variation rather than a permanent shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 74 units, which covers nearly 3 weeks of demand. With 42 units in transit (expected Period 17), the pipeline is sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the entirety of this post-peak regime (Period 3 to 13) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR engine computes a base stock that respects this lower consumption rate and high current stock levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (Women's Lingerie) experienced a significant drop in demand after the Valentine's Day peak (Feb 14). Since Period 3, demand has stabilized at a lower level. Over the last 12 periods (P3-P14), the mean demand is approximately 27.8 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P10-P14) average 28.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, with 83 units in pipeline (from orders in P13 and P14), totaling 132 units of position. Given a lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. 132 units covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. To ensure we maintain the target service level, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the stable post-peak demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 4 remains accurate based on early arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 (Late May). The demand regime changed post-Valentine's Day (Period 3) and has stabilized at a lower level. Over the last 13 periods (P3-P15), the average demand is ~28.8 units, while the last 5 periods averaged ~32.8 units (due to a slight uptick in P12 and P15). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (7), but there are 117 units in transit (ordered in P13, P14, P15), with the first batch (42 units from P13) expected to arrive during the current Period 16 and visible in Period 17 start. Total pipeline inventory + on-hand is 124 units. Using N=13 for mu_hat captures the post-Valentine's stability, while N=5 for sigma_hat captures recent volatility. The parameters target a base stock sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~145 units), meaning the system will likely place a small replenishment order to cover the gap.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/6/3). The demand regime has stabilized since the post-Valentine's drop in Period 3. Looking at the last 10 periods (Periods 7-16), the average demand is approximately 29.2 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline contains 163 units. Orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 are expected to arrive in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 respectively, based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since the current period's arrival (from Period 13) happens after this decision, we expect to be out of stock for the current period's demand (approx. 30 units), then replenish. To maintain service levels for the next 5 periods (L+1), we need approximately 150 units in the pipeline/on-hand. Our current pipeline of 163 is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=14 to cover the post-drop regime from Period 3 onwards) for demand parameters and continue monitoring the 4-period lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), the demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne remains within the post-Valentine's low-volume regime. Since Period 3, the average weekly demand has been approximately 29.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 17, and we are experiencing a stockout recovery after Period 16. However, lead times are consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17). We have a substantial pipeline (In-transit: 136 units) comprising orders from Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17. The Period 14 order (41 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 18) and become visible at the start of Period 19. Given the total pipeline of 136 units against an expected demand of ~30/week, our coverage is roughly 4.5 weeks, which matches the lead-time window. I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering the post-peak regime since P3) to ensure we don't over-order while we clear the current pipeline and maintain the target service level. L is kept at 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now stable in the data.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19 (2019/06/17). The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie). Historically, we saw a demand spike around Valentine's Day (Periods 1-2), followed by a lower, stable regime after Period 3. Since P3, the average demand is approximately 28 units. Recent arrivals (orders from P13 and P14) confirmed a consistent lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 36, and in-transit inventory is 118 (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). These incoming orders of 34, 46, 15, and 23 units are scheduled to arrive in P19, P20, P21, and P22 respectively. Given the current average demand of ~28, our pipeline is well-stocked for the next (L+1)=5 periods. I will use recent_N with N=16 (dating back to the P3 regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default promised lead time of 4 as it aligns with recent observations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '487722001' (Womens Lingerie Body) is in a stable post-Valentine's demand regime. Since Period 3 (2019/2/25), weekly demand has averaged approximately 28 units. Recent volume (Periods 12-19) shows an average demand of 31 units per period, with Period 16 experiencing a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 44 units, and the pipeline contains 103 units (orders from P16-P19), which are scheduled to arrive iteratively over the next four periods. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P15 order in P19. To ensure the OR backend appropriately captures the current demand level after the stockout noise and maintains a stock level to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods for mu_hat (covering the post-peak stable period) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The target inventory level (base stock) will ensure availability while managing holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/07/01. The product is a lace push-up body (womens lingerie). After the initial Valentine's Day spike (Periods 1-2), demand settled into a stable regime starting around Period 3. For the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged approximately 27 units (range 22-38). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20. On-hand inventory is 68 units, with 90 units in-transit (orders from P17-P20). Total pipeline inventory is 158 units. The base stock calculation for the OR engine (L+1 = 5 periods) based on recent demand averages approximately 135-140 units. Since current pipeline (158) exceeds the likely base stock target, the backend will naturally minimize ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 to capture the post-spike stability (since P3) while smoothing minor weekly fluctuations, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is steady at 4.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-08 (Period 22). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 17 through 21. Demand has settled into a post-Valentine's Day regime since Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 onwards (n=19 samples), the mean is approximately 28.5 units per period. The most recent demand (since Period 13) averages approximately 30 units. Given 'on-hand' (54) and 'in-transit' (86) totals 140 units, and expected demand for the (L+1)=5 period horizon is roughly 150 units, current inventory levels are nearly balanced but require small replenishment to cover the lead time window. I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the entire stable post-peak regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to maintain a steady stock level without over-ordering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (Womens Lingerie) showed a significant spike in Period 22 (75 units), likely due to a summer promotion or mid-July seasonal event. This is a sharp departure from the previous stable range of ~22-29 units observed since early June. Looking at on-hand inventory (2) and in-transit (92), the total stock position is 94. The expected demand over the next 5 periods (Lead Time 4 + 1 current) based on the recent average excluding the spike would be ~135, but adjusting for this potential upward shift is necessary. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to incorporate the latest trend while smoothing the volatility, and sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the increased variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July Demand Shift: Period 22 saw a 160% increase in demand (75 units) compared to the preceding 6-week average (~28 units). Tracking for sustainability of this higher demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' has experienced a significant and sustained spike over the last two periods (75 recorded on P22 and 87 on P23), coinciding with July. This confirms the mid-July demand shift noted in Period 23 was not an outlier but a new regime. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 133 units are in-transit, demand is now averaging ~81 units per week in this new regime, necessitating a build-up of safety stock to prevent further lost sales. I am transitioning to 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent spike while incorporating the transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift in July: Demand increased from an average of ~25 units to ~81 units (+224%) starting Period 22, likely due to seasonal summer trends or category-specific promotions.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '487722001' (Womens Lingerie Lace Body) has entered a significant high-demand regime starting Period 22 (July). Demand in the last three periods (75, 87, 67) averages ~76.3 units, compared to the previous ~25 unit average. This likely represents a summer seasonal peak or promotional period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, having been depleted by the sudden demand spike. There is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 215 units (ordered across Periods 21-24), with 11 units expected to arrive this period (ordered Period 21). To adjust for the sustained high demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current regime (~76 units/week), which scales to ~380 units for the L+1 window. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility of this new regime. This strategy should push the OR backend to place aggressive orders to replenish the stock-out and maintain a higher service level for the remainder of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed (Periods 22-24): Demand surged from avg ~25 to avg ~76 units (+200%). On-hand inventory depleted; pipeline replenishment required to meet sustained higher volume.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that started around mid-July (Period 22), likely due to summer seasonality or specific promotions for lingerie bodysuits. In Periods 22-25, demand shifted significantly from a stable average of ~25 units to an average of ~83 units (75, 87, 67, 103). Consequently, on-hand inventory is depleted, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts over the last three periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific July/August high-demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level (target inventory) sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while the pipeline replenishment (297 units in-transit) catches up.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne has shifted into a significantly higher summer/promotional regime starting in Period 22 (approx. 2019/7/8). Since Period 22, weekly demand has consistently increased: 75, 87, 67, 103, and now 129 in Period 26. This represents a confirmed regime shift from a baseline of ~25 units/week to an average of ~92 units/week over the last 5 periods (+268%). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand outstripping the previous delivery cycle. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 377 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 23-26), the OR engine needs to maintain this high-volume coverage. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period and set L to calculate based on the historical stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 22 confirmed: avg weekly demand rose from ~25 to ~92 units (Periods 22-26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 487722001 (Women's Lingerie) has undergone a significant sustained increase starting Period 22, likely due to summer seasonality or categorical promotions. The average demand for the last 6 periods (Periods 22-27) is approximately 95 units, compared to the previous stable baseline of ~25 units. We are currently facing a stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0, while 450 units are in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To address the demand spike and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime by focusing on the last 6 samples. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current peak while accounting for the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (Period 22-27): Average demand increased to ~95 units (+280% vs previous regime) and remains elevated into mid-August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2145.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 22 (early July). Over the last 7 periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged 97.6 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~25 units. The most recent demand (P28) was 113, confirming that the high-demand summer/late-August trend is sustained. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units) despite a large arrival in P28, due to the high demand surpassing previous forecasts. To ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) period window (5 weeks) and account for the current high-volatility, high-volume regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this new mean (~98 units/week * 5 weeks). I will also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this peak period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that prioritizes high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Period 22-28) is sustained with an average of ~98 units/week (+290% vs previous regime). Volatility has also increased significantly alongside volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 487722001 has entered a significantly higher regime since Period 22 (early July), likely driven by seasonal summer demand for lingerie/body suits. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P22-P29), the average weekly demand is approximately 94.6 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~25 units. Although Period 29 showed a slight dip to 74 units, the overall trend remains strong. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. With only 21 units on-hand and high expected demand, we must maintain a robust pipeline. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility, while keeping L at default (4) as arrivals are consistent.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 22 (July). Recent weekly demand (Periods 22-30) averages approximately 94 units, a significant increase from the previous average of ~25. The current date is 2019-09-09; seasonal trends for lingerie often show sustained interest post-summer, although a slight cooling from the August peak (avg ~114 in P26-28 to ~83 in P29-30) is observed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently very full (425 units in-transit) following aggressive ordering to catch up with the July/August surge. Given the current on-hand (38) and the large incoming pipeline (specifically orders from P27, P28, P29, and P30 totaling 133+110+123+59=425 units), we must avoid over-ordering as the peak potentially stabilizes or tapers. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9, covering Period 22 to present) to capture this higher regime while accounting for the recent slight variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Period 22-30) continues with an average of ~94 units/week. Recent weeks (P29-30) show a slight deceleration from the mid-August peak, averaging ~83 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $889.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. The high-demand regime that began in July (Period 22) is showing signs of cooling down in September. After peaking at over 100 units/week in August, demand in the last three periods (P29-P31) has been 74, 92, and 53 (average ~73). This drop likely reflects the end of the peak summer/holiday season for this lingerie item. On-hand inventory is now 118 with 377 units in-transit (orders from P28-P31). Total pipeline inventory is 495 units. Given the observed cooling of demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher volume compared to early spring but allow for the recent deceleration. Sigma_hat is set to the last 10 periods to reflect the continued volatility within this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in September: Average demand decreased from ~98 units/week (P22-P28) to ~73 units/week (P29-P31), indicating a transition out of the peak summer regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), the high-demand summer regime is transitioning into a lower autumn regime. After peaking at ~98 units/week (P22-P28), demand has decelerated to an average of ~71 units/week over the last 4 periods (P29-P32: 74, 92, 53, 66). Inventory levels have recovered significantly following the stockouts in July/August, with 162 units on-hand and 310 in-transit. The current inventory position is sufficient to cover approximately 6.5 periods of demand at the recent average. To reflect the current deceleration and avoid further overstocking during this transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the September slowdown. Standard deviation remains elevated compared to the spring regime, so sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to protect against potential late-season spikes or volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration trend continued in Period 32 (demand=66). Average demand for September (P29-P32) is ~71 units, down from the mid-August peak of ~98 units (-27%).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 487722001 (Women's Lingerie Body) is in a volatile transitional phase. After a summer peak (Avg ~98 in Aug), demand appeared to decelerate in Sept (Avg ~73). However, Period 33 unexpectedly spiked to 154 units. This spike might be a pre-October promotion or early autumn seasonal shift, but it contrasts with the general downward trend observed since late August. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (131) plus the incoming pipeline (187) is robust, totaling 318 units. Given the transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the mix of the deceleration and the recent spike (Avg ~84). This ensures we remain responsive to the high volatility (sigma_hat also uses recent_N) without over-committing to the single-period spike of 154, while protecting against lost sales if the spike persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late September: Period 33 spike (154 units) follows a deceleration trend (Avg ~71 in P29-P32). Sustained monitoring required to determine if this is a new regime or a one-off outlier.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility in late September and early October. After a summer peak (approx. 98 units/week) and a deceleration in early September (approx. 71 units/week), Period 33 spiked to 154 units, followed by a lower 58 units in Period 34. This suggests we are settling into a autumn regime that is periodically volatile but generally lower than the summer peak. The current inventory position is relatively strong (on-hand 132, in-transit 281), but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P30-P34) for mu_hat to capture this transition out of the summer peak while accounting for the recent volatility spike (avg for last 5 periods is approx. 85 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 5 to reflect the increased variance observed in these recent cycles. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for the 'Charlotte Body Push' has entered a volatile post-peak phase. After the mid-August peak (~98 units), September saw a deceleration to ~71 units, though Period 33 was a significant spike (154 units). The most recent two periods (P34-35) show demand of 58 and 86 units, averaging 72 units. While the carry_over_insight suggests a potential downward trend, the high volatility (sigma) must be accounted for to prevent stockouts, especially as we approach the Q4 holiday season. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 131 and 350 units in-transit (orders from P32-35), the pipeline is currently well-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=7, covering P29-P35) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak average demand (~83 units/week) while using a larger N for sigma_hat to account for the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand for the last 7 periods (P29-P35) has settled at ~83 units/week, down from the mid-August peak of ~98, but remains significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~25 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37). Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand regime starting Period 22 (July), which peaked mid-August (~98 units/week) and has since decelerated but remains volatile. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P29-P36) is approximately 86.6 units, compared to the spring baseline of ~25. Recent demand in P36 was 110 units, suggesting that while the summer peak has passed, demand is still robust, potentially due to pre-holiday interest in intimate apparel. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 64 units on-hand and 363 units in-transit (orders from P33-P36), the total pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a safe service level during this volatile post-peak phase, I am using a recent window of N=8 to capture the current mean and variance (~87 units/week). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P29-P36) shows a sustained average of ~87 units/week, significantly higher than the spring baseline but lower than the August peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 487722001 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in late July (Period 22). While there was a slight deceleration in early September, demand has surged again in October, with Period 37 reaching 149 units. This volatility suggests that the 'post-peak' stabilization previously noted (around ~87 units) was premature; the last five periods (P33-P37) have averaged approximately 111.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, although there is a significant pipeline (491 units). Based on consistent historical evidence, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent spike and 0 on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the fluctuations since late August/September) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility (sigma) while the pipeline catches up. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the high volume and the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in October: the average demand for P33-P37 is ~111 units, significantly higher than the mid-September 'stabilization' estimate of ~87 units. Regime is now characterized by high volume and high variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' has entered a significantly higher and more volatile regime in October/November (P33-P38 average: 123 units/week), likely due to seasonal Q4 demand or brand activity. The most recent demand (P38) reached 183 units, depleting all on-hand inventory despite a large arrival. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recent volatility Surge (P33-P38). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the increased standard deviation in this high-volume regime. This will ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to prevent further stockouts during the lead time interval (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Late October/Early November: Average demand for P33-P38 is ~123 units, with a peak of 183 in P38, indicating a potential Q4 peak or holiday ramp-up for lingerie.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 40 (Nov 11, 2019). The demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has shown a significant upward trend starting in Period 33, reaching an average of ~123 units over the last 7 weeks (P33-P39), with a peak of 183 units in P38. This likely reflects the start of the Q4 holiday/Singles' Day/Black Friday ramp-up. Current on-hand inventory is very low (23 units), having been fully depleted/low for several weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P35 order arrived in P39). To account for the recent volume increase and the high volatility (standard deviation has increased with the mean), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this 'Holiday Ramp' regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased variance. This will signal the OR backend to increase base stock levels to meet the higher demand while factoring in the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Q4 Ramp-up confirmed (P33-P39): Average demand increased to ~123 units/week (+41% vs Sep/Oct average of ~87), with high volatility (Max 183, Min 58).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). Demand is currently in a high-volume, high-volatility holiday ramp-up phase. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is approximately 125 units, with several peaks exceeding 150-180 units. The most recent demand (P40) was 126, and on-hand inventory is 0. Arrived units in Period 40 (56 units from P36) were insufficient to meet demand. Pipeline reconciliation: Order from P37 (128 units) is expected to arrive during Period 41 (conclude at P42). Orders from P38 (114), P39 (201), and P40 (196) follow. Total in-transit is 639. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given current volatility and high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (~625 units total for L+1) to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the holiday peaks. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect this high-volume holiday regime while excluding the quieter September periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Q4 Ramp-up confirmed (P33-P40): Average demand has stabilized at ~125 units/week (+44% vs Sep/Oct average), with persistence of high volatility peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the 'Holiday/Q4 Ramp-up' for this lingerie SKU is firmly established. Demand over the last 9 periods (P33-P41) has averaged 125 units, significantly higher than the previous period's average of ~87. Demand in P41 was 128 units, matching arrival exactly. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 642 units in transit. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given we are in late November (approaching Cyber Monday and December holiday peak), I will maintain high base stock parameters. I am using recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this holiday regime specifically (N=min(max(9,3),20)). This helps the OR backend cover the lead time (4) + current period (1) with a forecast based on the current high-demand, high-variance environment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter December (Period 43, 2019/12/02), the demand analysis confirms a significant holiday ramp-up. Since Period 33, demand has averaged ~131 units, but more recently (P37-P42), the average has increased to ~150 units, with peaks reaching 183 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (648 units) is slightly below the target for a 5-period window (L+1) at this elevated demand level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P38 order arriving in P42). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this most recent sustained surge (P37-P42 average of ~150) and apply recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in Q4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents further stockouts during the peak December shopping season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak acceleration confirmed: Average demand for P37-P42 increased to ~150 units/week, up from the early Q4 average of ~125. Stockouts occurred in 5 out of the last 6 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season for lingerie. Historically, demand has ramped up since Period 37, with a high volatility regime. Period 43 saw a temporary drop in demand (66 units) compared to the preceding 6-week average (~150 units), but given the lead time of 4 periods, we must forecast for late December and early January. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm a sustained high-demand regime, and stockouts have been frequent. Current on-hand inventory is 135 units, with a large pipeline (642 units) following aggressive ordering. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7 periods (P37-P43) which includes the holiday acceleration and the recent dip, averaging ~138 units/week. This balances the December peaks with the most recent observation to avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (P47). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to capture the high volatility seen in Q4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1329.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has shown significant holiday-related volatility: after an acceleration to ~150 units/week (P37-P42), the last two periods (P43-P44) have dropped back to an average of 74.5 units (66 and 83 respectively), suggesting we may have passed the pre-Christmas peak for this lingerie SKU or are seeing a temporary lull before final holiday shopping. Given the current date (Dec 16) and the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in mid-January, well after the holiday peak. Current inventory position is strong: On-hand is 248 units and In-transit is 507 units (Total pipeline 755), covering approximately 6-7 weeks of demand even at late-autumn levels (~120/week). I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat (covering the late Sep to Dec period) to capture the broad holiday regime while acknowledging the recent deceleration. This provides a balanced forecast of ~120 units/week (total mu_hat around 600 for L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak holiday deceleration observed in early December: Demand decreased to average ~75 units/week in P43-P44 from the peak of ~150 units in the preceding weeks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The carry-over insights indicate a significant deceleration in demand following the Q4/holiday peak. Demand in the last three periods (P43-P45) has averaged ~79 units (66, 83, 87), which is a sharp drop from the ~150 units seen during the late November peak. With 292 units on hand and 384 units in transit (a total pipeline of 676 units), and demand currently trending around 80 units/week, we have approximately 8 weeks of coverage. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and the post-peak deceleration, I will shift mu_hat to reflect this new regime (N=4) to prevent further overstocking as we enter the post-holiday period. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect the recent, lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed (starting P43): average demand dropped to ~79 units/week from the peak of ~150. Current pipeline provides 8+ weeks of coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday period (Date: 2019/12/30). A clear demand deceleration has been observed since Period 43. Demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) has been: 66, 83, 87, 44, averaging approximately 70 units/week. This is a significant drop from the holiday peak of ~150 units/week. Historical data from early 2019 shows that after Valentine's Day (mid-February), demand dropped even further to ~25 units/week. Given the current on-hand inventory (368) and pipeline (307), we have 675 units available, which covers roughly 9.6 weeks of demand at the current 70 units/week rate, or much longer if demand reverts to the spring baseline of ~25 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this deceleration and setting sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered but still present post-peak volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P46 arrive from P42). No additional orders are likely needed this period as the pipeline is saturated relative to the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration (starting P43) confirmed: average demand decreased from ~150 to ~70 units/week (-53%).
