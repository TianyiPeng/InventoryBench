Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple fashion item for women. Looking at the initial demand samples (57, 73, 88, 73, 96), there is a slight upward trend as we move through February. The average of the provided 5 samples is 77.4. The promised lead time is 4. Since we have no historical lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), the 5 samples provided represent the most recent available data reflecting current pre-spring demand levels; I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent average. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the observed volatility in these samples. The OR backend will calculate the base stock target for (L+1) = 5 periods to ensure coverage for the lead time plus the review period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is Jeggings, a staple item. Initial demand on 2019-02-11 was 156 units, which is significantly higher than the training samples provided (mean of ~77). This suggests a strong regime shift or seasonal spike occurring in mid-February. I have 103 units in transit from Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4. At the current demand rate, I am heavily understocked. Since I only have one new demand point (156) and the training history, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to blend the recent high demand with the latter part of the history, and explicit for L to ensure the OR backend accounts for the promised 4-period lead time while I wait for actual lead-time data to conclude.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because previous orders have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 2 periods, the absence of arrivals is expected and does not indicate a lost shipment yet (Period 1's order is expected at Period 5). Historically, demand for these Jeggings has been: 57, 73, 88, 73, 96 (pre-game) and 156, 124 (game history). The mean demand over these 7 samples is 95.2. Recent game demand (156, 124) is significantly higher than the pre-game average (~77), suggesting a demand shift or seasonality as we move towards spring. To capture this recent higher demand regime while maintaining stability, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 (covering the last 3 samples: 96, 156, 124) and default for L and sigma_hat. This ensures we don't under-order for the current trend.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product ('Jeggings H.W') has experienced high demand (Avg ~118) over the first three weeks, but we have had zero on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L=4 means P1 order arrives P5). Therefore, we will still have 0 on-hand inventory for Period 4's demand phase. The total in-transit (464) covers orders from P1, P2, and P3. I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 4 until we observe actual arrivals. For demand forecasting, I'll use the mean of all historical samples (57, 73, 88, 73, 96, 156, 124, 76), which is approximately 93 units per period. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. mu_hat should handle (1+L) * 93 = 465. Given the high initial demand in the game history which might indicate a stock-up or high season for denim in early spring, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent and higher demand levels closer to the current period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Jeggings, a staple item. Initial demand (Period 1-4) has been high (avg 105), though it appears to be stabilizing or slightly declining from an initial peak. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, we should see the conclusion of this arrival at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 627 units, covering orders from Periods 1-4. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages for arrivals, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. I will use a conservative demand estimate based on all available historical data (pre-game samples + game history) to set the base stock level. The mean demand across all 9 data points is approximately 89. With L=4, mu_hat (1+L) * mean is 5 * 89 = 445. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the default global statistics to account for the initial high demand variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4. We currently have 31 units on-hand and 524 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand data shows: 57, 73, 88, 73, 96 (pre-game) and 156, 124, 76, 64, 72 (actual periods). There was a significant spike in Period 1-2 (likely a seasonal transition or promotion for Jeggings), which has since stabilized around an average of 70.7 units over the last 3 periods (P3-P5). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this stabilized post-spike demand level, which aligns better with the pre-game baseline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture volatility while reflecting the recent stabilization. L is set to default as the lead time of 4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Initial demand spike in P1-P2 (avg 140) has stabilized to ~71 in P3-P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1630.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we have visual confirmation that the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The initial demand surge (avg 140 in P1-P2) has subsided. Demand over the last four periods (P3-P6) has averaged 76 units (76, 64, 72, 92). Although there was a slight uptick to 92 in P6, the overall regime is stable around the 75-80 range. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (In-transit: 345) + On-hand (118) = 463 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (approx 6 periods of cover). I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in the 4-period observation, and use a 'recent_N' of 4 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stability (avg ~76). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the initial launch phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-launch: P3-P6 average demand is 76 units, down from P1-P2 average of 140. Lead time consistency at 4 periods reaffirmed by P2 arrival in P6.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 'Jeggings H.W' enters a stable demand regime post-launch. Historical analysis shows an initial launch spike (P1-P2 avg 140), followed by a lower stable phase (P3-P6 avg 76). However, the most recent demand in Period 7 was 130, which likely signals an April/Spring seasonal uplift for denim leggings as the weather warms. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). On-hand inventory is 170 with 163 in-transit (ordered in P4, expected to arrive in P8 resolution). Since current pipeline (170 + 163 = 333) covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the recent average (~75) but only ~2.5 periods if the P7 spike (130) persists, I will favor recent data (N=5: P3-P7) to account for this spring seasonality while maintaining the confirmed lead time L=4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level (L+1=5 periods) that anticipates the potential seasonal increase.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand uplift detected: Period 7 demand spiked to 130 (+71% compared to P3-P6 average of 76).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are in a confirmed spring seasonal uptrend for Jeggings. After an initial post-launch stabilization at ~76 units (P3-P6), demand has risen significantly to 130 (P7) and 113 (P8), averaging 121.5 over the last two weeks. This aligns with spring fashion cycles. On-hand inventory is healthy (220) and a shipment of 130 is in-transit (ordered P8, expected P12). Given the promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with observations (P1-P4 all arrived with L=4), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the elevated spring demand regime (avg ~122/week). The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime confirmed: P7-P8 average demand increased to 122 units/period, a ~60% increase over the previous stable period (P3-P6 avg 76).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. Demand history shows three distinct phases: initial launch spike (P1-P2 avg: 140), a stabilization period (P3-P6 avg: 76), and a recent seasonal uplift starting in late March (P7-P9 avg: 116.7). The last three periods (P7-P9) recorded demands of 130, 113, and 107 respectively, confirming a sustained higher demand regime compared to the stabilization phase. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8. Pipeline inventory (272) includes orders from P8 and P9. To account for the recent seasonal shift while smoothing out week-to-week volatility, I am using recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining the validated lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand confirmed (P7-P9): average demand is ~117 units/period, representing a significant increase over the P3-P6 'stable' average of 76.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained spring seasonal demand regime. Demand for Jeggings (Ladies Denim) shifted upwards starting in Period 7 (March 25). The\u5e73\u5747 demand from P7 to P10 is approximately 109 units (130, 113, 107, 86). While P10 showed a slight dip (86), this is likely normal variance around the new elevated mean rather than a regime downshift, especially as we enter peak spring/early summer. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (27), and we are waiting for the P8 order (130 units) to arrive in P12 (conclude message read in P13). To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (total 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P7-P10) to capture this higher spring baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR engine maintains enough stock as the 'In-transit' pipeline starts clearing.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings'. Looking at the demand history since the spring seasonal uplift (starting P7), demand has stabilized around ~108 units/period (P7-P11 average: 130, 113, 107, 86, 104 = 108). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and experienced lost sales in Period 11. However, there is a large pipeline (In-transit: 548 units). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 8 (130 units) to arrive in Period 12, and the order from Period 9 (142 units) in Period 13. To manage the current seasonal regime, I will use recent_N to capture the last 5 periods of demand (P7-P11), which reflects the spring demand level better than the full history. L is set to 4 based on consistent arrival confirmation in history. mu_hat will be (1+4) * 108 = 540, and sigma_hat will be calculated based on the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime (P7-P11) average clarified at ~108 units/period, following the launch and stabilization phases.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand spring seasonal phase (May 6th) for Ladies Denim Jeggings. Recent demand (P12) hit 140 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization average of 76. The seasonal average (P7-P12) is approximately 113 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). Current on-hand inventory is 0, making us heavily dependent on the arrival of orders placed in P9, P10, and P11. To prevent further stockouts during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6, covering the spring seasonal regime P7-P12), which results in a mean of ~113.3. This will set a base stock level that targets a high service level (~95%) for (L+1) periods, which is critical given the current zero on-hand status and high profit margin vs. low holding cost ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime for Jeggings (P7-P12) established with a mean of 113 units, significantly higher (+48%) than the late-winter stable period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The product (Jeggings) is in a sustained spring demand regime. Since Period 7 (late March), demand has averaged approximately 111.4 units per period (samples: 130, 113, 107, 86, 104, 140, 97). Recent volatility (sigma) is slightly elevated compared to the stable winter period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (orders from P8 and P9 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P12 and P13). There is currently an on-hand inventory of 45 and a pipeline of 473 units. The 473 units in transit correspond to orders from P10 (137), P11 (139), P12 (51), and P13 (146). The P10 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 14 (observed in P15). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand regime since P7. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=7 to reflect recent variance. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/20. We are in the Spring/Summer season for 'Ladies Jeggings'. Looking at the history, the lead time is stable at 4 periods (P8, P9, and P10 orders arrived exactly in P12, P13, and P14). Demand in the current Spring regime (P7-P14) has averaged 114 units per period (130, 113, 107, 86, 104, 140, 97, 137). The most recent period (P14) saw a significant demand of 137. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this Spring average for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The on-hand inventory is low (45), but there is a substantial pipeline of 442 units (mostly orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), which aligned with the 4-period lead time should arrive over the next four periods. Maintaining the current logic prevents over-ordering while ensuring we cover the lead time + review period demand (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for Jeggings (P7-P14) confirmed with an average of 114 units per period, showing sustained higher volume compared to early-year stabilization. Lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The 'Spring' demand regime (starting Period 7) is well-established. Analyzing the demand from Period 7 to Period 15, the mean is 115.7 units (Sum: 1042 / 9 periods). Recent demand (last 3 periods: 97, 137, 128) shows a slight uptick, averaging 120.6 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, and 15). The current inventory position is 56 on-hand plus 450 in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). Given the stable nature of the current spring regime, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire seasonal period for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to capture the variability (range ~86 to 140) within this regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (Jeggings) is in a sustained spring demand regime. Analysis of the demand from Period 7 to Period 16 shows an average demand of approximately 113.7 units per week, which is consistent with the 'Spring seasonal demand' identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 12 order in Period 16. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there is a large pipeline (542 units). To maintain the stock level given the current demand regime and lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (P7-P16) which covers the established spring regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this same 10-period window to capture recent volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a women's denim jegging. Analysis of recent demand from P7 to P17 shows a stable spring/early summer regime with a mean of approximately 114 units per period (Avg of P7-P17). Total demand over the last 11 periods is 1256 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P13 through P17. Inventory position: On-hand is 39, with 489 units in-transit (Orders from P14, P15, P16, P17). The expected arrival for Period 18 is the order from P14 (106 units), which will bring on-hand up to ~145, comfortably covering expected demand. To maintain the base stock for the L+1 window (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the steady seasonal performance since the spring uplift, as there is no evidence of a mid-summer slowdown yet.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The product is Jeggings, which has been in a sustained spring seasonal demand regime since Period 7. Demand in the most recent periods (P14-P18) has been 137, 128, 102, 112, 114, averaging 118.6 units. This is consistent with the 'Spring seasonal demand' identified in carry-over insights (~114 avg). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P14 order arrived P18). With on-hand inventory at 31 and 490 units in-transit (covering orders from P15, P16, P17, P18), the pipeline is healthy. For the OR parameters, I'll use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entirety of the spring regime (P7-P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects this higher sustained volume. Calculated lead time is appropriate as it has been consistently 4 units since the start.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime (P7-P18) has maintained a stable mean of approximately 116 units per period across the last 12 weeks.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Jeggings) has been in a sustained spring demand regime since Period 7. Over the last 13 periods (P7-P19), demand has averaged 111.9 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) show a slightly lower average of 108.6 units, but still consistent with the seasonal regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the arrival in Period 19 (ordered P15) confirming this. I am setting L to default (4). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=13 to capture the entire spring seasonal regime (P7-P19) which provides a stable mean of ~112 units per period (multiplied by 1+L in the backend). For sigma_hat, N=13 is also used to capture the volatility of this specific regime. This remains the most appropriate strategy until a seasonal downturn (summer/fall transition) is clearly detected in the data.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand has significantly dropped in the last two periods (87 in P19, 54 in P20), marking a potential end to the Spring/Early Summer regime identified in the carry-over insights (which averaged ~116). Dating into July suggest a mid-summer lull. In-transit inventory is high (392 units) relative to recent demand, and on-hand is 180. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the sharp drop to 54 in P20, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for the mean to allow the OR backend to react to the slowing demand trend, while maintaining a wider window for sigma (default) to account for the historical volatility of this SKU. This helps avoid significant overstocking during the transition into summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand dropped to 54 units, significantly below the P7-P19 spring average of ~115 (-53%), suggesting the start of a summer seasonal lull.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 20 (late June/early July). The average demand from Period 7 to Period 19 (Spring regime) was approximately 115 units. In the last two periods, demand dropped to 54 and 76 respectively, averaging 65 units (a ~43% decrease). This confirms the 'summer lull' insight noted in the carry-over. High on-hand inventory (197) and significant in-transit units (299) mean current coverage is high relative to this lower demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime while considering the transition from the spring peak. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand lull confirmed: P20-P21 average demand dropped to 65 units, compared to P7-P19 average of 115 (-43%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are currently in a summer demand lull for Jeggings. Analysis of demand from Period 20 to Period 22 shows an average demand of 71.3 units (54, 76, 84), which is significantly lower than the Spring peak average of ~115 units. This matches the seasonality expected for heavy denim items during peak summer months. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower volume regime while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from P17 and P18 in P21 and P22). With an on-hand inventory of 220 and 192 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20), our pipeline is currently well-stocked for this lower demand period. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the historical stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand lull confirmed: P20-P22 average demand is 71 units, a ~38% decrease from the P7-P19 spring average of 115.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand lull for Jeggings, starting around Period 20 (late June). The average demand from Period 20-23 is approximately 76 units (54, 76, 84, 89), which is significantly lower than the Spring average of ~115. On-hand inventory is currently high at 242 units due to shipments ordered during the Spring peak arriving now. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the summer lull average (~76 * 5 = 380 for L+1). Given current on-hand (242) and in-transit (83) units, the backend will likely order a very small amount or zero, which is appropriate for managing the current inventory surplus during this slower season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand analysis shows a sustained decrease since Period 20 (late June), aligning with a summer seasonal lull for Jeggings. The last five demand observations are 54, 76, 84, 89, and 38, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 68.2 units per period. This represents a ~40% drop from the spring average of 115. Inventory is currently high with 285 units on-hand and 104 in-transit (P23: 2 units, P24: 102 units), because the system is still receiving orders placed during the higher-demand spring regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this lower-demand summer regime and prevent excessive overstocking while waiting for inventory levels to normalize.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand lull (P20-P24) confirmed: average demand is 68 units/period, a ~41% decrease from the P7-P19 spring average of 115.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We have confirmed a summer demand lull starting around Period 20 (late June). The average demand from Period 20 to Period 25 is approximately 65.7 units per period, which is significantly lower than the Spring peak (~115). Specifically, the last two weeks (P24-P25) have seen demand of 38 and 53, reinforcing this lower regime. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. With 232 units on hand and 136 in-transit (Total pipeline: 368), and a projected demand of ~66/period, we have enough stock for roughly 5.5 periods. To align the OR backend with the current summer regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the data since the demand drop in Period 20. This will lower the replenishment target and avoid excessive holding costs during this slow period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the middle of a summer demand lull (P20-P26), where demand has averaged approximately 64 units per period, a significant drop from the spring average of 115. Recent demand in P24-P26 (38, 53, 54) confirms this lower regime. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 178 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 171 units (from orders in P23, P24, P25, P26). With a current inventory position of 349 units against a projected 5-period demand (L+1) of roughly 320 units, the system is well-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer low while maintaining enough stock for potential late-summer variability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August, historically transitioning from a summer lull (P20-P27 average demand ~71) toward potential autumn demand changes. Examining the 'conclude' messages, actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). However, the orders from P21 and P22 (which were for 0 units) have 'arrived' as empty shipments, explaining why 'In-transit' now only reflects orders from P24 onwards. Current inventory (On-hand 101 + In-transit 210 = 311) is relatively high. I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering the summer lull P20-P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most recent demand regime of ~71 units/period. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue relying on the consistent 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand lull confirmed: P20-P27 average demand is 71 units/period, a consistent ~38% decrease from the Spring average of 115.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/8/26). Demand has stabilized in a 'summer lull' regime since Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 28 is approximately 65.4 units per period (54, 76, 84, 89, 38, 53, 54, 79, 61), which is a significant decrease from the Spring average of 115. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 142 and 194 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P25, P26, P27, P28), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this lower summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and calculate lead time based on the consistently observed 4-period duration.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for Jeggings has been in a summer lull since Period 20. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand has been 63.4 units, which is significantly lower than the spring average of 115. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P24-P29) show a slightly lower consistent mean of ~56 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 129 and a pipeline (in-transit) of 217 units, total inventory (346) is sufficient to cover approximately 5.4 periods of demand at current rates (346 / 63.4). Given the lead time is 4 periods and we must account for demand in the current period and the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), the inventory position is healthy but requires a consistent order flow to maintain safety stock as summer transitions into autumn. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the summer lull mean and volatility while monitoring for any early-September back-to-school surges.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand lull (P20-P29) continues: average demand has further stabilized to ~63 units/period, compared to the earlier Spring average of 115.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand remains in the summer lull regime, which began at Period 20. The last 11 periods (P20-P30) show a mean demand of approximately 61.5 units, significantly lower than the preceding Spring peak (~115). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P27-P30) have had demands of 79, 61, 45, and 53, confirming that demand is stable around this lower mean. Lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods, verified by arrivals in Periods 27, 28, 29, and 30 all matching orders from 4 periods prior. My inventory position (on-hand 111 + in-transit 217 = 328) is sufficient for approximately 5.3 periods of current demand, which covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the summer regime and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to reflect the current volatility. This keeps the OR engine tuned to the current seasonal reality while avoiding over-stocking during the lull.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is in a summer demand lull that began around Period 20. The current date is mid-September (2019/9/16). Demand has been consistently lower than the Spring peak, with the last 12 periods (P20-P31) averaging 63.5 units/period. The most recent demand (P31) was 66 units, which aligns with this stabilized lower regime. Lead time remains very consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 27 order arriving in Period 31. Inventory is currently well-managed with 86 on-hand and 222 in-transit, totaling 308, which covers about 4.8 periods of current average demand. I will maintain the current regime's forecast (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this 'new normal' stabilization and keep Lead Time at the default (promised) value of 4 as it is highly stable.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The 'Summer demand lull' detected earlier (P20 onwards) remains the dominant demand regime. In the last 13 periods (P20-P32), the average demand has been approximately 62.5 units per period. The most recent demand samples (P29-P32: 45, 53, 66, 64) average 57 units, showing high stability without any immediate sign of an autumn recovery yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory position (On-hand: 108 + In-transit: 201 = 309) is relatively healthy against a 5-period demand window (approx 315 units), I will set the parameters to reflect the stable summer regime. I'm using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this lower-demand period while smoothing out weekly fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1777.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Historical data indicates a summer demand lull starting around Period 20 (June 24). However, recent data from Periods 31-33 show demand of 66, 64, and 97, which represents an upward trend compared to the mid-summer average of ~63 (P20-P29). The jump to 97 in Period 33 suggests the potential start of an Autumn recovery as customers transition back to denim and full-length trousers. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P29 order arriving in P33). To respond to the rising demand while accounting for recent variability, I will transition mu_hat to a recent_N method using N=5 (covering Periods 29-33) to capture the recent localized mean shift toward 75 units/period (avg of 45, 53, 66, 64, 97). This allows the system to adjust upward from the summer lows without overreacting to the single spike of 97. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery detected starting Period 33: Demand increased to 97, significantly above the summer lull average of 63, signaling the likely end of the summer low and start of Autumn seasonality for Jeggings.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn season (October). Historical demand shows a summer lull (P20-P32) with an average of ~63 units, but Period 33 spiked to 97. Period 34 saw a drop back to 48, but the overall trend for Jeggings typically recovers in Autumn. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P32-P34: 64, 97, 48) which averages ~70. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=3 for demand to capture the start of the seasonal pivot while respecting the recent lower data point.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal transition: Demand in P33 (97) and P34 (48) suggests a departure from the steady summer lull (~63), though volatility is currently high.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223035' (Jeggings) is transitioning out of the summer lull. Recent demand in P33 was a high of 97, but P34 and P35 were lower (48 and 45). However, typically denim products see an Autumn recovery in mid-October. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 64 units, but including the P33 spike, there is high volatility. With 54 units on hand and 336 in transit (most arriving in the next 3 periods), we are moderately covered. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the start of the autumn shift while tempering the P33 spike with the recent lower weeks, ensuring we don't over-order before a clear sustained uptrend is confirmed. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jeggings' is currently in Period 37 (October 21). Historical data from P33 onwards shows highly volatile demand (97, 48, 45, 41), averaging 57.75 units. This is a downward shift from the initial 'Autumn transition' observation in P35, actually coming in lower than the Summer lull average (~63). Given the erratic nature of the recent 4 samples, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this immediate downward volatility while maintaining enough stock for a potential late-autumn spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand + In-transit (78 + 278 = 356) is relatively high compared to recent demand, so the OR backend's capping mechanism will likely moderate the order size to prevent overstocking during this uncertain period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Initial Autumn recovery was short-lived; P33-P36 demand has averaged 58 units, which is lower than the summer lull average of 63, indicating high late-season volatility for Jeggings.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jeggings, and we are entering late October (Period 38). Previous insights identified a 'Summer lull' (P20-P32) with demand ~63. While P33 saw a spike to 97, the subsequent four periods (P34-P37) have shown demand (48, 45, 41, 56) that is actually lower than the summer average. We are currently in a high-volatility, low-demand phase before potential late-Autumn or Holiday increases. Since Period 33, demand has averaged 57.4 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P33-P37) to capture this current regime which is more conservative than the overall history but more responsive to the recent post-summer behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the P33 order arriving exactly in P37). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the recent volatility (the spike in P33 vs the lower subsequent weeks).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery is showing high volatility; demand P33-P37 has averaged 57, which is lower than the summer lull average (63) despite a single spike in P33.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are observing the demand patterns for 'Jeggings' as we enter the late Autumn season. Following the summer lull (approx. 63 units/period), the demand has shown increased volatility starting Period 33. While Period 33 saw a spike to 97, the average demand from Period 33 to Period 38 is approximately 61 units (97, 48, 45, 41, 56, 78). This suggests that the expected 'Autumn recovery' has not yet manifested as a sustained higher regime, instead maintaining a mean very close to the summer levels but with higher variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 104 and in-transit at 189, our pipeline is healthy. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recent volatile but lower-mean period, and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~21 in the recent period vs ~7 in the summer lull).

Carry-over insight: Demand from P33-P38 has averaged 61 units, indicating that the 'Autumn recovery' is currently tracking at levels similar to the summer lull (63) but with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation increased from ~7 to ~21).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) has shown three distinct phases: Spring peak (~115 units), Summer lull (~63 units), and a current 'Autumn' phase characterized by high volatility but a low average (P33-P39 mean ~61). Despite an initial spike to 97 in P33, the subsequent weeks have averaged only 55 units. With on-hand inventory at 157 and in-transit at 171, we have 328 units covering our pipeline, which is well above 5 periods of average demand (61 * 5 = 305). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (std dev ~21) in this latest phase, I will use recent_N=7 (P33-P39) to capture this increased noise while maintaining the lower mu_hat to avoid over-ordering during what appears to be a continued low-demand period with high variance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for Jeggings remains in a lower-volume state with high volatility as winter approaches. Recent demand (P34-P40) has averaged 52.3 units/period, significantly lower than the P7-P19 spring average (115) and slightly lower than the 'summer lull' average (63). The high volatility (standard deviation ~15) observed since P33 persists. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 124 units on-hand and 213 in-transit (covering roughly 6 periods of recent average demand), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand average since the P33 transition, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in the late-year period.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter consolidation: Demand (P34-P40) has averaged ~52 units/period, showing a further decrease from the summer lull average (63) and significantly trailing the spring peak (115). High volatility (std dev ~15) characterizes this period compared to the more stable summer.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late Autumn/early Winter period for Jeggings. Demand has further softened and stabilized at a lower level since Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to 41 is 50.1 units per period, which is significantly lower than the summer lull (63) and the spring peak (115). Volatility remains moderate (std dev ~14). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). On-hand inventory is 113, and in-transit is 210, totaling 323 units of pipeline inventory. This covers approximately 6 periods of current demand, which is lean but appropriate given the downward seasonal trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower late-year demand regime (P34-P41), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the spike in P33.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter demand regime (P34-P41) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~50 units/period, down from the summer lull (63). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

The current date is 2019/12/02. Historical demand analysis shows a transition from a summer lull (~63 units) to a lower, highly volatile late autumn/early winter regime. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 90 units, contrasting with the P34-P41 average of ~50. This spike may be related to early December/holiday shopping, though previous winter weeks were much lower. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 64 units on-hand and 169 in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41 total 169), our pipeline covers approximately 4.5 periods of the current average demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=9, covering P34-P42) to capture the current regime including the recent spike, which results in a slightly higher forecast than the late-autumn average to protect against further holiday-related increases. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the late-season volatility (std dev ~16).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Winter demand volatility confirmed. While the P34-P41 average was ~50, a spike to 90 in P42 suggests potential early-December holiday influence, contradicting the previous downward trend.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand history (P34-P43) shows a significant amount of volatility but maintains an average of roughly 57 units per period. The recent spike in P42 (90 units) followed by a sharp drop in P43 (19 units) suggests a holiday-driven oscillation common in early December retail. Given we are in Period 44 of 47, there are only a few periods left. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 138 and 161 in transit (total pipeline = 299), we are well-covered for the remaining game duration if demand stays near the recent average. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current late-year demand level (~57 units/period) while accounting for the high volatility in sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation prevents over-ordering during the final periods while maintaining a buffer for potential pre-Christmas spikes.

Carry-over insight: Late-year demand volatility (P34-P43): Average demand ~57 units with significant weekly oscillation (range 19-90), likely due to holiday seasonality.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16), mid-December. Current demand for Jeggings has been highly volatile over the last few periods (P42: 90, P43: 19, P44: 26), reflecting late-year holiday shopping patterns where spikes (Pre-Christmas) are followed by lulls and potential post-holiday clearance. The average demand from P34-P44 is approximately 54.2 units, which is a better representative 'Winter' level than the extremely low P43-P44 readings. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 161 units on-hand and 146 in-transit (Total pipeline: 307), we are well-covered for the standard 5-period lead-time horizon (L+1) at the current mean. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat (P34-P44) to capture the current Winter regime's average while accounting for the high volatility in sigma_hat.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the peak holiday/post-holiday transition phase. Recent demand has been highly volatile: 90 (P42), 19 (P43), 26 (P44), and 89 (P45). This volatility is consistent with late-year consumer behavior for apparel. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P42-P45) is 56 units, but the high standard deviation (~36) requires a cautious approach to avoid stockouts during potential late-holiday clear-outs or gift exchange periods. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P41 order arrived in P45). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday-driven mean (~56 per period), while sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the significantly heightened volatility (increased from ~15 to over 30). This allows the OR backend to maintain a sufficient safety buffer for the high-variance environment of late December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed (P42-P45): Mean demand ~56 but weekly range is 19-90 (std dev ~36), requiring higher safety stock despite a lower mean than Spring peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). The current context for Jeggings is the post-holiday/New Year period. Recent demand (P42-P46) has been extremely volatile due to holiday spikes (90, 19, 26, 89, 72), with an average of ~59 units. The 'Period 46 conclude' confirms that the order from Period 42 (which was actually 0) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals in P46, maintaining a stable lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is low at 27, but in-transit is a healthy 255. Given the high holiday volatility (std dev ~31 over the last 5 weeks), I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-variance regime while moving past the mid-December lows. L is set to calculate as lead time remains stable at 4.
