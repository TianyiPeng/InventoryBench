Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the SKU lifecycle (Period 1, 2019/2/11). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief', a women's swimwear bottom. Historical demand shows a significant ramp-up in the last three weeks: 61, 98, 152. This suggests the early stages of a seasonal ramp-up as we head into spring/summer. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since on-hand and in-transit are both zero and we expect a seasonal increase, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent upward trend rather than the early zero-demand periods. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until actual arrival data is observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 18, 2019. We are looking at women's swimwear (bikini bottoms). Historical data shows demand starting from zero in early Jan and rising to 152 by Feb 4. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 129. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 179 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Based on the promised lead time of 4, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5. Demand is clearly in a growth phase as we approach the warmer seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. The mean of recent demand (samples for Jan 21, 28, Feb 4, Feb 11) is approx 110. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this upward shift from the initial zero-demand period. For L, I will stick with the promised value (default) as we have no evidence of lead time deviation yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), we are entering the spring season for swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief). Demand has shown a clear upward trend: 61, 98, 152 (pre-game samples) followed by 129 and 213 in Periods 1 and 2. Currently, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 354 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order (179 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at P6). Demand is accelerating as we move closer to the beach season. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent growth while being mindful of the OR backend's cap. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), emphasizing the need for accurate mu_hat forecasting to avoid excessive stockouts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief', a piece of women's swimwear. Current date is early March (2019-03-04). We are seeing a significant demand surge coinciding with the lead-up to the spring break and pre-summer season. Demand samples (0, 0, 61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175) show a clear upward regime shift from zero to a mean of approximately 154 units over the last 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and all units are currently in-transit due to the 4-period lead time. No orders have arrived yet (first order from P1 is expected in P5). Given the seasonal nature of swimwear, demand is expected to remain high or continue increasing as we move further into spring. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the active demand regime (since demand was 0 before) and keep lead time at the promised 4 periods as no evidence of delay exists yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21; swim season ramp-up confirmed with demand averaging ~154 units/week over the last 4 weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' swimwear item. The demand history shows a significant ramp-up starting in late January (samples: 0, 0, 61, 98, 152) and continuing through February/early March (129, 213, 175, 173). The mean demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 172.5 units/week, confirming the swim season ramp-up noted in the carry-over insights. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 818 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Since we haven't reached the promised lead time for any orders yet, we will stick with the default lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the established 'peak season' demand regime (172.5 avg) rather than the zero-demand periods from early January.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~173 units/week over the last 4 periods (Feb-March), reflecting peak swim season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18). The product is 'Women's Swimwear', which matches the current season's demand spike. Since Period 1, we have faced significant stockouts due to the lead time delay (promised 4 periods). Period 5 finally saw the arrival of the Period 1 order (179 units), but the demand was 181, leaving us with 0 on-hand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand has stabilized at a high level: the last 5 samples are 129, 213, 175, 173, and 181 (Mean ~174). I will use N=5 for mu_hat (approx. 174 * (1+4) = 870) and N=5 for sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the current sustained peak demand while we wait for the significant pipeline (684 units) to arrive over the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Sustained peak swim season demand averaging ~174 units/week confirmed over periods 1-5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item in late March, which is the heart of its peak season. Historical demand data (from January to March) shows a clear ramp-up followed by stabilization: 0, 0, 61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173, 181, 200. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 2-6) is 188.4 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of orders from Period 1 and Period 2 in Periods 5 and 6, respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded arrivals, and there is a high pipeline of 696 units. To maintain service levels during this peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods of data (N=5) to capture the higher stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the volatility. I will use the default lead time method since 4 periods is verified.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in peak swim season (Feb-Mar) at an average of ~188 units/week (Periods 2-6), significantly higher than the initial ramp-up phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '599580017' is a women's swimwear bottom, currently in its peak season as evidenced by the consistent demand growth from Period 1 to Period 7. On Period 8 (2019/4/1), we observe that the previous period's demand (Period 7) spiked to 268 units, well above the previous average of ~188 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P3 order arrived in P7). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory because demand exceeded the arrival of 237 units. There are 677 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To handle the significant increase in demand observed in P7 and the anticipated continued peak season for swimwear in April, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (encompassing demand from P5, P6, and P7), which averages ~216 units per period. This recent window better captures the recent peak (268) while acknowledging the previous levels (181, 200). L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (68 units standard deviation) observed during this peak jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand surged to 268 units, significantly higher than the P2-P6 average of 188 (+42%). Swimwear peak season demand is highly volatile but remains in an upward trend at the start of April.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's swimwear, currently in peak season (early April). Demand has accelerated significantly from a P2-P6 average of 188 to 268 (P7) and 376 (P8), a 100% increase over the previous regime mean. This rapid growth suggests the previous forecasts were too conservative. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this momentum. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (sold < demand), meaning we are losing significant profit. The pipeline inventory (742 units) includes orders from P5 (45), P6 (187), P7 (218), and P8 (292). The P5 order (45 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 9 resolution (L=4). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, with demand trending sharply upward, explicit forecasting for mu_hat ensures we don't under-order during the lead time coverage period (L+1 = 5 weeks). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat effectively sets a weekly demand expectation of ~281, covering the current trajectory better than a long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: weekly demand transitioned from ~188 (Feb-Mar) to a new peak regime averaging 322 units over P7-P8 (+71% vs prior regime).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019, which is peak season for swimwear. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant amount of backlogged demand being lost each period. High demand volatility is evident: Period 8 spiked to 376 units, while Period 9 settled at 295 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) is 313 units, which is a marked increase (+66%) compared to the Feb-Mar average of ~188. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out and failing to meet the full demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this new high-demand regime during peak season. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed in April, ensuring the inventory policy is responsive to the current trend while balancing high holding costs against high service level needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at new peak: April (P7-P9) average demand is 313 units/week, up from ~188 in Feb-Mar (+66%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a swimwear bottom, which is currently in its peak demand season. Analysis of the demand history shows a significant shift in April: the average demand for Periods 7-10 is 326.5 units/week, compared to the February-March (P1-P6) average of 178.5 units/week. Specifically, the last four weeks (P7-P10) show demand values of 268, 376, 295, and 367. Although we have 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand exceeding arrivals, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). To capture the current peak demand regime and avoid under-ordering, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4, focusing on the April demand spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to better reflect the increased volatility seen during this peak season. Lead time L is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at high-peak level for late April: P7-P10 average demand is 326.5 units/week, an 83% increase over the P1-P6 average of 178.5 units. Volatility has also increased significantly during this period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) is experiencing a massive seasonal surge as we approach the end of April. Recent history (P7-P11) shows demand values of 268, 376, 295, 367, and 477, with the most recent figure being the highest yet. The current mean for this high-demand regime (last 5 periods) is approximately 356.6 units/week, a significant leap from the 188 avg seen in Feb/Mar. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand consistently exceeds supply arriving from earlier, smaller orders. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). To prevent stockouts during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this surge. The OR engine will use these values to generate a base stock that accounts for both the high mean and the high variance, ensuring the capped policy doesn't undershoot required stock cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak accelerated in Period 11: Late April demand reached 477 units; 5-period average (P7-P11) now at 356.6 pods/week (+89% vs early-season average).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the height of the swimwear season (May). Demand has significantly surged, with the last two periods showing demand of 477 and 468 units respectively. The average demand for the last five periods (P8-P12) is 396.8 units per week, which represents a massive increase from the early season. My goal is to capture this high-peak demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating we are selling through arrivals immediately. The arrival in P12 (292 units) was completely sold. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For Period 13, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this accelerated peak demand regime, which equals (1+4) * 396.8 = 1984. I will also use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in April/May. This aggressive stance aims to maximize units sold during the highest demand weeks of the year for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak accelerated further: P8-P12 average demand reached 396.8 units/week (+123% vs P1-P6 early-season average of 178). Seasonal peak for womens swimwear is now firmly established in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, peak swim season for women's swimwear. Demand has significantly accelerated throughout April and early May. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) show demand of 295, 367, 477, 468, and 332, averaging ~388 units/period. Period 13 saw a slight dip to 332, but the overall trend remains high as we approach summer. The observed lead time is stable at 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). In-transit inventory is high (1555), but given the 4-period lead time and demand averaging nearly 400 per week, this pipeline is necessary to cover the (L+1) = 5 week window, which currently requires ~1940 units (388 * 5). Using recent_N=5 captures the current high-demand regime while respecting the increased volatility seen in late April (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high-peak May levels: P9-P13 average demand is 387.8 units/week (+117% vs P1-P6 average). Peak summer demand remains sustained with high volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (May). Over the last six periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 392 units/week, significantly higher than the early season. Recent weekly demand samples (P11-P14) are 477, 468, 332, and 417, demonstrating both high volume and high volatility (standard deviation ~66). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 85 units on-hand and 1,437 in-transit (covering orders from P11 to P14), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle the 1+4 period horizon. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime of ~392 units/week and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last month. This approach balances the need to meet high peak demand while acknowledging the current stock-out risk seen in earlier weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is late May and firmly within the peak summer swimwear season. The product (Womens Midrise Brief) is seeing sustained high demand. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 412.8 units (477, 468, 332, 417, 370). Although demand in the last three weeks has softened slightly compared to the peak in late April (P11/P12), it remains well above the early-season average. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 15 conclusion where the Period 11 order arrived). Pipeline inventory is currently 1590 units, which covers several weeks of demand, but with on-hand inventory nearly depleted (4 units), we must maintain high mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level. I will use the last 7 periods (P9-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand 'summer peak' regime, which averages ~393 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak summer levels for May: P9-P15 average demand is 389.5 units/week. Volatility remains high, but lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's midrise bikini brief, currently in the peak summer demand phase (June 3rd). Recent demand in Period 16 spiked to 525 units, significantly above the average. The demand regime over the last 8 periods (P9-P16) averages 419 units/week, showing sustained high-peak behavior but with high volatility (std dev ~70). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 16. The pipeline (1576 units) consists of orders from P13 (492), P14 (288), P15 (442), and P16 (354). To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for the recent spike and seasonal peak, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the summer average (~419) across the coverage span (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility of the peak season, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this high-margin/high-holding cost balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime high-peak summer shift: Period 9-16 average increased to 419 units/week (+135% vs P1-P6). Period 16 reached a new seasonal high of 525 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, which is the heart of the summer swimwear season. Current on-hand inventory is 162 with a substantial pipeline of 1540 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The demand for product 599580017 has shown high volatility but remains in a high-peak regime. Specifically, demand in Period 16 hit a seasonal high of 525, while Period 17 saw a drop to 330. Over the last 9 periods (P9-P17), the average demand is approximately 409 units/week. Since we are entering the peak summer month of June, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this sustained high regime while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) during this peak period. The OR engine will use this to maintain a base stock level that accounts for roughly (L+1)=5 weeks of demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, representing the heart of the summer swimwear season. Demand has been high but volatile, with a recent 10-period average (P9-P18) of ~388 units/week. Period 18 saw demand of 302, which is lower than the peak of 525 but consistent with earlier May/June fluctuations. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 148, with a significant pipeline of 1540 units (orders from P15-P18). Given the high seasonality, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime for Mu and Sigma, ensuring the base stock accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the replenishment period (L+1 = 5 periods). A recent_N of 10 for Sigma captures the recent high volatility observed in April and May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019-06-24), we are in the heart of the summer swimwear season. Current inventory is 73 units on-hand with 1,352 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). Demand remains high and volatile, with recent weekly demands of 525, 330, 302, and 517 (Average P16-P19 = 418.5). This aligns with the 'Peak Summer' regime identified in Carry-over Insights (P9-P16 average ~419). Given we are at the end of June, demand is expected to remain near this peak for the next few lead-time windows before the typical late-summer taper. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (P9-P19) to capture this established peak summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it encompasses the relevant seasonal high-point. This method balances the extremely high peaks with the slight regressions to ensure the OR backend creates a sufficient base stock to maintain service levels during high-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Summer Peak: Period 9-19 average demand is 406 units/week, maintaining consistent high volume through June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' surged to 771 units in Period 20 (late June), signaling a significant 'High Summer' peak beyond the previous average of ~406 units. Historically, swimwear demand peaks in June/July. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the target service level is 50%, which naturally leads the base stock to target the mean demand. However, the recent spike to 771 must be factored in to prevent stockouts during this peak seasonality. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the high summer regime (Periods 9-20), which averages ~436 units/week, while allowing for the increased volatility seen in the last period. This balances the extreme 771 peak with the more sustainable 350-500 unit range observed throughout May and June.

Carry-over insight: High Summer peak confirmed in Period 20: Demand surged to 771 units (+90% vs previous regime average of 406). Seasonality suggests sustained high demand for July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting the peak of high-summer demand for swimwear. In Period 20, demand surged to 771 units, followed by 592 units in Period 21. This confirms a significant step-up in demand compared to the May/June average of ~400. Over the last three periods (P19-P21), demand averaged 626.6 units with high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 1699 units. Orders arriving in the next four periods (P22-P25) were placed in P18-P21 (288, 254, 540, 617 respectively). The pipeline for the next 4 periods totals 1699 units. Given the recent peak and the July calendar context, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this high-summer regime (N=3, mean ~627; mu_hat = (1+L)*627 = 3135). I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (std dev ~133; sigma_hat = sqrt(5)*133 = ~297). This aggressive forecasting ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to satisfy the July peak while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High Summer peak confirmed in July: P19-P21 average demand reached 626.6 units/week, a +54% increase over the previous summer regime of ~406 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23), which is the peak season for women's swimwear. Demand has significantly accelerated in the last three periods (P20-P22), averaging 635 units/week (771, 592, 542), compared to the prior regime average of ~406. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 2253 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-22). To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed in July, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the immediate July peak. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current surge, helping to mitigate the current frequent out-of-stock situations caused by the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak established: P20-P22 average demand is 635 units/week, a 56% increase over the May-June average of 406. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the third week of July (Period 24). The inventory status is critical with 0 on-hand and high demand leading to stockouts. Demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (swimwear) has surged, stabilizing in a 'High Summer' peak regime. Over the most recent three periods (P21-P23), demand averaged 548 units (592, 542, 510), following an extreme peak of 771 in P20. While the absolute peak may have passed, demand remains significantly higher than the May-June average of ~400. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 2833 units in transit and ongoing stockouts, our mu_hat must reflect this sustained high demand to ensure the OR engine targets an appropriate base stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. We select recent_N based on the last 4 periods (P20-P23) to capture this new elevated regime while damping the extreme P20 outlier moderately.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (Period 25), currently experiencing the high summer peak for swimwear (SKU 599580017). Demand in the most recent periods (P20-P24) has been extremely high, averaging approximately 625 units/week (771, 592, 542, 510, 710). We are currently facing stockouts at the end of each period despite arrivals, because demand is consistently outstripping what was ordered during the previous, lower-demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm that the July peak (P20-P22 average ~635) is significantly higher than the May-June average (~406). Given we are at the end of July, demand is expected to remain high but could begin to fluctuate or settle as we transition toward August. To ensure we capture this high-volume peak while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5), which covers the specific July peak regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed through P24: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 625 units/week, maintaining the high-volume regime first detected in Period 21. Volatility remains high during this peak phase.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. We are transitioning from the peak July demand period into August. Historical demand in P25 dropped significantly to 309 units compared to the July average of ~625. This likely signals the beginning of the post-peak seasonal decline for swimwear as the summer season matures. The 'July peak' regime (P21-P24) saw demand ranging from 510 to 771. In P25, demand fell to 309, which is closer to the May/June levels (~400). To avoid overstocking during this downturn while maintaining a sufficient buffer, I will adjust the demand forecast. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the high volatility of the last few weeks (617, 542, 510, 710, 309) which averages 537.6 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will allow the model to respond to the high variance and the recent downward movement while preventing a drastic under-correction if P25 was an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 25: Demand dropped to 309 units from a 4-period average of 625 (-50%), signaling the likely end of the high-summer peak and the start of seasonal decline for swimwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-798.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has clearly entered a post-peak seasonal decline. After a high-summer peak averaging over 600 units in July, demand dropped to 309 in P25 and further to 176 in P26. We are currently in mid-August, transitioning out of the primary beachwear season. Historical lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to aggressively lower the demand forecast to reflect this end-of-season trend to avoid accumulating excess inventory during the decline. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the steep downward slope (309, 176, and projected further decline). On-hand inventory is currently high (974) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P22 order of 842 arrived in P26), and there are still 1666 units in-transit. Given the high current inventory and falling demand, the OR backend capped policy should naturally reduce or skip new orders to minimize holding costs while the surplus is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Seasonal decline is accelerating as we move into mid-August; demand dropped from a July peak average of ~630 units to 176 units in Period 26 (-72% drop from peak).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1544.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for swimwear has entered a sharp seasonal decline as we move through mid-August. Demand dropped from a July average of ~630 units to 176 in Period 26 and 132 in Period 27. The current on-hand inventory (1,676) and in-transit units (832) are extremely high relative to this new demand regime. Specifically, the total pipeline (2,508 units) would cover approximately 19 periods of demand at the current rate (~132 units/week), whereas the target coverage is only 5 periods (L+1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 periods to reflect this rapid deceleration and to prevent the OR engine from ordering more units. The engine's capping mechanism and the large existing inventory will naturally result in zero orders, which is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 27: Seasonal decline is rapid, with demand dropping to 132 units (-80% from July peak levels).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1552.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (swimwear) has entered a sharp seasonal decline as we move into late August. Demand dropped from a July peak average of ~635 units to 309 (P25), 176 (P26), 132 (P27), and 155 (P28). The average over the last four periods is approximately 193 units. Due to orders placed during the July peak arriving now (lead time is stable at 4 periods), we have a significant inventory surplus (on-hand: 1707, in-transit: 646). With a total pipeline of 2353 units and a current demand run rate of ~150-200 units, we are oversupplied for the end-of-season period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the new, lower demand regime (avg 193) and set L to 'default' as lead time is stable. No new orders are needed; the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will naturally zero out orders given the current inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Post-peak late August demand has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 193 units/week (P25-P28), down ~70% from July peak levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms) entering September, which marks the end of the peak summer season and a firm transition into the low-demand autumn regime. Historical demand shows a sharp decline from the July peak of ~635 units/week to a stabilized low regime averaging 143 units/week over the last 5 periods (P25-P29: 309, 176, 132, 155, 139). Currently, on-hand inventory is 2,214 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the current low demand regime (~143/week), this inventory represents approximately 15 weeks of supply, far exceeding the requirements for the 4-period lead time plus the review period. To minimize holding costs and prevent further overstocking during this off-season phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period low-demand regime. This will result in zero new orders until the inventory level naturally depletes to safer levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-peak low: P25-P29 average demand is 143 units/week, down 77% from the July peak of ~635. Seasonal off-season confirmed for September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item, and as of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), it is entering the deep off-season. Demand has consistently plummeted from the July peak (>600 units/week) to a post-peak average of ~132 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), with the most recent sample hitting a low of 78 units. We currently have 2,136 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), the primary objective is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. No new orders are needed as the current inventory (2,136) is sufficient to cover over 15+ weeks of demand at the current rate (2,136 / ~130). I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and set L to default, which will naturally result in zero orders due to the high inventory-to-demand ratio.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal off-season confirmed: Demand has dropped to a 5-period average of 132 units (P26-P30), down ~80% from July peak levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2006.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item currently in the mid-September off-season. Demand has collapsed from a July peak of ~635 units/week to a very low and stable regime, averaging approximately 103 units/week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 132, 155, 139, 78, 65). The current on-hand inventory of 2071 units is extremely high, covering over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), minimizing further inventory is paramount. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the off-season lows, which will ensure that the OR engine places zero orders while the existing surplus is slowly depleted.

Carry-over insight: September off-season demand finalized: average for P27-P31 dropped to 103.8 units/week, down 84% from July peak levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item currently in Period 33 (late September). Historical data confirms a significant seasonal decline that began in August (Period 26), with demand dropping from a July peak of ~635 units/week to recent levels near 30 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 2041 units, which is extremely high relative to the current demand regime (~100 units/week average for P27-P31, trending lower to 30 units in the most recent period). There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period) and the clear shift into the off-season, no further orders are required. The priority is to exhaust the existing stock to minimize holding costs. I will set L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low off-season demand (~100 avg), ensuring the OR backend sees that we already have years' worth of stock at current demand rates.

Carry-over insight: Post-season stabilization: Demand for Period 27-32 averages ~100 units/week, confirming a deep off-season regime for swimwear through September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1971.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is swimwear, and we are currently in late September, which is the deep off-season. Demand has plummeted from a July peak (~635 units/week) to an average of ~48 units/week over the last three periods (P31-P33). We currently have 2006 units on-hand with zero units in-transit. Given the inventory level and the seasonal decline, we have enough stock to cover roughly 40 weeks of off-season demand at current levels. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (P29-P33 average ~69 units), while allowing the OR engine to calculate based on this lower mean and variance. The high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculation will automatically prevent new orders.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season confirmed for late September/October: Demand for P31-P33 averages 43.3 units/week, marking the lowest regime of the year.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1882.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the deep off-season for swimwear (October). Demand has plummeted from a July peak of ~635 units/week to a very low regime. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged approximately 48 units/week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,944 units following the arrival of large late-season orders. Given that the holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalizing. No further orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-demand regime (using recent_N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation remains low, which combined with the high on-hand inventory, will result in an order of 0 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season regime for October confirmed: demand averaged ~48 units/week over P31-P34, down 92% from July peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (womens swimwear) is in a deep off-season regime as of mid-October (P36). Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last 5 periods (P31-P35) averaging 46 units/week compared to the July peak of over 600. On-hand inventory is extremely high (1906 units) due to late-season arrivals and a sharp seasonal drop-off in August. This inventory level covers approximately 40 weeks of current demand, meaning no new orders are required. The OR parameters are set to reflect this low-demand state to prevent the system from placing any unnecessary orders while we bleed off the existing stock. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for demand looking at the last 5 periods to capture the current off-season baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), and we are currently in late October (Period 37). The data confirms a deep off-season regime that began in September. Demand has plummeted from a July peak of ~635 units/week to an average of 43.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1863 units, which is enough to cover over 40 weeks of current off-season demand. Consequently, no new orders should be placed. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (last 5 periods) and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to minimize further holding costs by letting the existing inventory bleed down.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '599580017' (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its deep off-season (Late October). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 45.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). The current on-hand inventory is 1,813 units, which is extremely high relative to current demand (approximately 40 weeks of cover). No further orders are needed. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To prevent the OR backend from placing any unnecessary orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime, and the backend's capped policy will ensure the order remains at 0 given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season stable: Demand for P33-P37 averages 45.6 units/week, maintaining the low-volume October regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in a deep off-season regime (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) being approximately 45.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 1777 units, which is significantly higher (nearly 40x) than the current weekly demand, leading to high holding costs. No further orders have been placed since Period 25. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level; however, our massive overstock makes the safety stock calculation secondary to liquidating/holding existing units. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stable off-season regime, ensuring the OR engine does not trigger any new orders while we draw down the excess on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep off-season (November), with demand consistently averaging ~45 units/week over the last 7 periods (P33-P39). On-hand inventory is currently 1,743 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the remainder of the season and any reasonably calculated base stock level (estimated at ~250-300 units). Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the priority is to avoid any further procurement and liquidate existing stock. The OR backend should be set to a low demand forecast to ensure no new orders are triggered. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: November off-season confirmed: Demand remains stable at a low regime, averaging 42.4 units/week (P35-P39), representing a 93% decrease from July peak levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). The SKU is a swimwear item in a deep off-season regime (late autumn). Historical demand from Period 35-40 (October/November) has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 40.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,701 units due to over-ordering during the late July peak just before the rapid seasonal drop-off. With on-hand inventory covering over 40 weeks of current demand and only 7 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 47), no new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to its promised default of 4 and use a recent N=6 to reflect the stabilized off-season demand mean and variance (Periods 35-40). The high on-hand inventory will easily satisfy all remaining demand, and the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order given the surplus.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms) currently in its deep off-season (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) being approximately 37 units per week. The latest demand in Period 41 was only 17 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1,684 units, which is extremely high (approximately 45 weeks of supply at current demand rates). No further orders are needed. The OR backend needs to be instructed to recognize this low-demand regime and high inventory level. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the core of this stabilized late-season/off-season demand without including the higher volume periods from early October. This will result in a very low base stock, and since on-hand inventory (1,684) far exceeds any possible base stock for 37 units/week demand, the OR engine will correctly order 0 units.

Recent demand (Periods 35-42) has remained extremely low, averaging 45.9 units per week, despite a slight outlier of 113 units in Period 42 (likely a minor promotion or early holiday shopping). Inventory levels are very high (On-hand: 1571), far exceeding the projected demand for the remainder of the year. The primary objective is to avoid further holding costs. I will set the base stock parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (averaging around 46 units) to ensure no new orders are triggered. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: December off-season confirmed: Demand remains at a low-volume regime (averaging ~46 units/week), despite minor volatility in Period 42. Extremely high inventory levels (1500+) will cover all remaining periods of the season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Timeless Midrise Brief) is in a deep off-season period (December). Current on-hand inventory is 1,520 units, which vastly exceeds any realistic demand for the remaining 4 periods of the year, given the recent 9-period average of approximately 48 units/week. Over the last three weeks, demand has been 17, 113, and 51 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), minimizing additional inventory is the only viable strategy to mitigate further holding cost losses. No new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N where N=9 covering the stable off-season starting P35) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary replenishment.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December), and the game concludes at Period 47. The product is a swimwear item in its deep off-season. Recent demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 51 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). The current on-hand inventory is 1,463 units, which is significantly higher than any conceivable demand for the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (Periods 45, 46, and 47). Since the profit per unit ($1.0) is equal to the holding cost ($1.0), and we have more than enough stock to cover all remaining demand, no further orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to reflect the current low-volume off-season regime, and 'default' for lead time, though the excessive inventory makes the specific parameter values secondary to the goal of not ordering more units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), which is the deep off-season for swimwear. The product is a Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear). The demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) has averaged approximately 49 units per week, showing consistent low-volume off-season behavior. Current on-hand inventory is 1,405 units, which is extremely high relative to the current demand regime and the fact that there are only two periods left in the game (P46 and P47). Because the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), and we have vastly more inventory than we could possibly sell before the game ends, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units. The inventory will easily cover the remaining demand for P46 and P47 without any further replenishment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical data, though it no longer impacts ordering decisions given the surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1291.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the final period of the game for this SKU (Timeless Midrise Brief, a swimwear item). The demand regime is in a deep off-season, with current demand averaging approximately 50-60 units per week. The ending inventory from Period 46 is 1348 units, which is drastically higher than any foreseeable demand in the final step. Since a holding cost of $1.0/unit applies to every unit in ending inventory (matching the $1.0 profit per unit sold), any additional orders would only increase holding costs without providing any benefit. The objective for this final period is to maximize R_t by selling through existing stock and minimizing redundant holding costs. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a low value reflecting the current off-season mean, and use recent lead time history, which will result in a zero order from the OR backend because the high on-hand inventory already exceeds the calculated base stock.
