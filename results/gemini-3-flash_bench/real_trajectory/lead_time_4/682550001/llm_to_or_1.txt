Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Uno Hood', a jersey basic hoodie. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a mean of approximately 56.8 units (45, 45, 110, 34, 50). The spike of 110 on Jan 21 suggests potential variability or a specific event, but the most recent two weeks returned to 34 and 50. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Day 1 with no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a baseline order to cover the (L+1) window. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all historical data points for the initial forecast of mu_hat and sigma_hat, and the promised lead time for L. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is very high (19:1), which will result in a high target service level (safety stock).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie'. Historical demand shows a mean of 57.8 units/period, but there was a significant spike of 110 units on Jan 21 (possibly a holiday-related event or promotion). The most recent demand (Period 1 conclude) was 37 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (107 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand in Period 1 (37 units) was lost because nothing had arrived yet (as expected with L=4). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent trend (avg=54.8) over the more volatile full history, while keeping sigma_hat default to capture the variance from the Jan 21 spike. Lead time is set to default (4) as we have no delivery data yet to suggest a shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a jersey hoodie (Uno Hood), which is a basic apparel item. Historically, the demand for the last 5 samples was [45, 45, 110, 34, 50], and the most recent demands in the game (P1, P2) were 37 and 47. The spike in Jan (110) suggests some volatility, but recent demand is stable around 40-50 units per week. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 209 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1 and P2 orders haven't arrived yet (which is expected for L=4), we cannot yet confirm the actual lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent stable demand of ~47 units while acknowledging the slightly higher historical mean. For sigma_hat, N=7 includes the historical spike to ensure we maintain enough safety stock. L is set to 'default' as no evidence suggests a deviation from the promised 4 periods yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' zip hoodie, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) and game history (P1-P3) show a relatively stable mean around 45-50 units per period, with one outlier (110 units on Jan 21). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the P5 conclude message, available at the start of P6). In-transit inventory (308 units) reflects orders from P1-P3. Since no orders have reached the 4-period mark yet, there is no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments yet. MU_HAT: I will use the recent 8 samples (5 historical + 3 game history) to capture the current mean (approx 53.3). With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 53.3 \u2248 266. SIGMA_HAT: Standard deviation across these 8 samples is approx 23.7. With L=4, sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 23.7 \u2248 53. L: We will stick to the promised lead time (4) as no data yet contradicts it.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a basic jersey hoodie ('Jersey Basic'). Historically, demand started at 45 (late Jan) and shifted to a range of 37-50 in Feb/March (avg ~43). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first order (107 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and should be visible in the next 'conclude' message (Period 6 START). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 350 in-transit (sum of orders from P1-P4: 107+102+99+42=350). There is no confirmed lead-time deviation yet. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (approx 44 units per week) and maintain the default lead time of 4. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand = 5 * 44 = 220. However, the OR backend uses 'recent_N' to calculate this directly from history. I will use N=4 to capture the stable demand seen in the conclude messages (37, 47, 49, 40).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5, confirming the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (including provided samples and game history) has been: 45, 45, 110 (outlier), 34, 50, 37, 47, 49, 40, 34. Excluding the outlier of 110, the demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~42. The hoodie is a basic jersey item; mid-March in many regions marks the transition from winter to spring where demand for light layers like hoodies remains steady before dipping in late spring. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~41). This accounts for the (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 243 (orders from P2, P3, P4) and on-hand is 73. Since (L+1)*41 = 205, and we have 316 total units in the system, the OR backend will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the current excess against immediate needs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand stable around 40-50 units per week following P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 observations.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a 'Divided Basics' Hoodie. Historical demand samples (P1-P6) show: 37, 47, 49, 40, 34, 63, plus pre-history samples. The mean demand across all observed periods (including pre-history) is approximately 50 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 orders arriving as expected. Currently, we have 112 units on-hand and 141 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). No orders were placed in P5/P6 because the pipeline exceeded requirements. The OR backend will use the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime (since P1) more effectively than the full history, as P6 showed a slight uptick (63) which might indicate early spring demand for hoodies. No new sustained shifts beyond the confirmed lead time are present yet.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The product is a basic hoodie, which typically sees stable demand in early spring. Historical demand samples (excluding the Jan 21 peak) show a mean of approximately 45 units/week. Recent demand in Periods 5-7 (34, 63, 43) confirms this stable regime (Avg=46.6). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Period 7 conclude shows 168 units on-hand and an arrival of 99 units. In-transit is 53 units (P4 order of 42 units + P7 order of 11 units). The pipeline (168 + 53 = 221) is sufficient to cover protected demand for (L+1)=5 periods (approx 230 units). I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the current stable demand environment and calculate for L to reinforce the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current inventory is 134 on-hand with 60 in-transit. The history confirms a lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Historical demand shows a stable baseline with some upward fluctuations in recent weeks (76 units in P8). Looking at the product (Hoodie) and dates (late March/early April), we are in a spring transition period where demand for light layers like hoodies remains steady or slightly higher. To set parameters, I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand behavior after the initial setup phase. This includes the recent spike in Period 8. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the variability seen in the last few weeks of sales.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic jersey hoodie. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 34 and 110 units, with a recent mean (Periods 1-9) of ~49.3 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 5, arrivals have matched the promised lead time (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). No order was placed in P5 or P6, explaining the zero arrival in P9. Currently, on-hand (79) and in-transit (137) total 216 units. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent average of ~50 units/week, our target inventory should be around 250 units plus a safety buffer. Demand in P8 spiked to 76 but dropped to 55 in P9, suggesting no sustained regime shift yet. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-sample behavior while acknowledging the 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/22. The product is a basic jersey hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically has stable demand in mid-spring, though it may see slight fluctuations based on regional weather. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a mean of approximately 48 units per week (min 26, max 76). The last two periods (9 and 10) saw demand of 55 and 26 respectively. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (L=4). There are no arrivals in Period 9 or 10 because no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6 (as seen in history). Orders from Period 7 (11 units), Period 8 (49 units), Period 9 (77 units), and Period 10 (72 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively. Total pipeline is 209, and on-hand is 53. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable demand baseline while incorporating the lower recent volume in the forecast. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). For SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood), the service level (q) is 0.95 (19.0 / (19.0 + 1.0)). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 26, and in-transit is 225. Reviewing demand from the last 11 documented weeks (ignoring seeds), observations are: [37, 47, 49, 40, 34, 63, 43, 76, 55, 26, 38]. The mean demand is approximately 46 units per week. There is no significant seasonal evidence or regime shift detected yet (recent demand is slightly lower, but within historical volatility). Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time. We use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the last few periods more heavily, covering the 5 periods (L+1) required to bridge the lead time. Pipeline inventory (225) + On-hand (26) = 251, which is roughly 5.4 weeks of mean demand, well-positioned for a 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are managing 'Uno Hood', a jersey sweatshirt. Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 47 units over the last 12 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P7, and P8). At Period 13, on-hand inventory is 21 units. However, we have a significant pipeline 'In-transit' of 243 units (consisting of orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). The P9 order (77 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P13) and will be visible in the P14 conclusion. Given the high pipeline relative to the average demand of ~47/week and lead time of 4, the current base stock logic should maintain adequate coverage. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full history since the start of the game, as demand has been stable without significant regime shifts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. The product is a hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically experiences steady demand in spring before tapering off in summer. Demand has been stable between 26 and 76 units, with a mean of approximately 48 units over the last 13 weeks. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 7, 8, and 9. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is high at 187 units, which includes orders from P10 (72), P11 (27), P12 (67), and P13 (21). The P10 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current Period 14 (read at P15). Given the stable demand and consistent lead times, I will use a recent_N approach (N=13) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the full active history since P1. L will be kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, and P14). Demand has remained stable without significant seasonal shifts in the recent spring period, averaging approximately 45 units over the last 14 periods. The most recent demand (P10-P14) shows a slight softening (avg ~38), but nothing indicating a major regime change. Given the lead time is 4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat provides a stable 10-week moving average to buffer against minor fluctuations while maintaining enough stock to handle the L+1 window. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance across the full history, which is appropriate for a stable 'Basics' item.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie with stable demand. Historical demand analysis shows a consistent mean around 46 units per week (min 26, max 110, but mostly between 34-63). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show demand of 38, 54, 40, 32, and 43, averaging 41.4 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. On-hand is 82 and in-transit is 176 (Total 258). Expected pipeline needs to cover roughly 5 * 46 = 230 units. The current total inventory of 258 is slightly above the predicted 5-period demand, but since the service level (profit/(profit+holding)) is high (19/20 = 95%), a small buffer is appropriate. I will use 'calculate' for L as it is stable at 4, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=15) and sigma_hat (N=15) to capture the overall stable profile while leaning slightly towards established patterns rather than the initial noise.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. The product is a basic hoodie. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 11-16. Demand has remained relatively stable but shows a recent uptick in Period 16 (82 units) compared to the previous weeks' average of approx 40. The current date (early June) is generally a transitional period for apparel; however, basic hoodies don't exhibit extreme seasonality here. I will use the last 5 periods (Period 12-16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand variance while maintaining the default lead time of 4. On-hand (67) + In-transit (124) = 191 units. With an estimated demand of ~54/week, pipeline cover is approx 3.5 weeks, which is slightly lean given the 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to ensure sufficient base stock to cover demand until the next delivery window (L+1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18 (June 10th). Historically, demand for this SKU (Uno Hood) has remained stable with an average of approximately 47 units per period. Lead time has consistently validated at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (186 units) plus current on-hand (45 units) totals 231 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using the long-term mean of 47, we need roughly 235 units. The recent spike in Period 16 (82 units) suggests some volatility, but Period 17 returned to the mean (43 units). I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it has been perfectly consistent at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the demand behavior over the last three months, which averages out the recent spikes while staying responsive to the current stable regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie. Looking at the demand history since Period 1, the weekly demand has been consistently stable, mostly fluctuating between 26 and 63 units, with a few outliers (82 in Period 16, 110 in the seed data). The recent demand average (last 10 weeks) is approximately 45 units per week, which aligns with the carry-over insight. The lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods for all 10 concluded orders (P5-P18). Pipeline inventory (228) and on-hand (42) total 270 units, which covers about 6 weeks of demand at the current average. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will continue using 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to capture any subtle shifts in the mean and variance without being overly reactive to high-noise weeks like Period 16.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24 (Period 20). The product is a basic hoodie ('Uno Hood'), which generally sees stable demand outside of major seasonal shifts. The concluded history (Periods 1-19) confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has remained relatively stable; recent samples from Periods 15-19 are [43, 82, 43, 39, 32]. The demand of 82 in Period 16 appears to be an outlier compared to the surrounding weeks. The pipeline (in-transit) is 190 units, and on-hand is 62 units, totaling 252 units. Expected demand over L+1 (5 periods) is approximately 235 units (using a mean of ~47), meaning current inventory position is adequate. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period history and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent variability while smoothing out the outlier observed in Period 16.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this hoodie (Uno Hood) has remained stable with a mean of 46.4 units per week across all 20 periods. There is no evidence of a summer seasonal dip or spike yet; demand in the last 5 periods (Periods 16-20) averaged 44.2, which is consistent with the long-term mean. Comparing the last 10 periods (Avg=43.1) to the previous 10 (Avg=49.7), there is a slight decrease but not a significant regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 11-20). The pipeline inventory (196 units) plus on-hand (52 units) totals 248 units, which covers approximately 5.3 periods of average demand (46.4 * 5.38 = 248). Given L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stable history since the start of the game.

The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, there are 81 units on-hand and 145 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 44.4 units. Since demand hasn't shown a systemic shift in regime but exhibits moderate weekly noise, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced view of recent volume while capturing the variance necessary for the OR backend to maintain an appropriate safety stock buffer against potential spikes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a jersey hoodie, which typically experiences lower demand during summer months but may see a slight uptick in prep for late summer evenings. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) has averaged 45.9 units per period, with recent demand in P21 and P22 showing 54 and 55 units respectively. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22 conclude messages all show L=4). Pipeline inventory (123) + On-hand (104) = 227 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at current rates. Given the stable demand and reliable lead time, I will use a 10-period window to capture the recent stable regime, which avoids over-reacting to individual spikes while providing a safety buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-22 (late summer). The product is a hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically sees stable or rising demand as autumn approaches. Historical demand has remained fairly stable, with a mean of 44.8 units/period over 23 periods and a recent 5-period average of 41.8. Analysis of the lead-time history shows arrivals consistently at 4 periods (validated through Period 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 75 units and in-transit is 164. Given the target service level (q=0.95), I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period lead time is consistent. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 15 samples (recent_N=15) to capture the stable demand regime from the past few months while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, preparing for the transition into late summer/early autumn sales.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a basic jersey hoodie ('Uno Hood'). Demand has remained remarkably stable throughout the last 24 periods, fluctuating mostly between 25 and 60 units, with an occasional outlier. Statistical analysis shows a mean demand of approximately 42 units and a standard deviation around 13 units. Lead time analysis from the 'Period X conclude' messages consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (matches promised). Since there is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonal spike in late July (Northern Hemisphere late summer), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable long-term mean and variance while filtering out the initial warm-up noise. The parameters L=4, mu_hat (1+L)*mean, and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std are intended to maintain a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, transitioning from summer into the back-to-school season. The product is a 'Uno Hood' zip-up hoodie, which typically sees increased demand as temperatures drop and the school season begins in mid-to-late August and September. Historically, demand has been stable between 25-80 units, with a mean of approximately 45 units over the last 10 periods. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Given the product category (hoodies) and the calendar date (early August), I anticipate a seasonal uptick in demand soon. To prepare for this, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility, while slightly padding the forecast to account for the expected seasonal rise without over-ordering. L will remain at the calculated average (4) as shipments are arriving exactly as promised.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences increased demand as the fall season approaches. Looking at the historical demand for the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 41.7 units with a standard deviation of 11.2, showing stability throughout the summer. However, the initial context (samples from Jan/Feb) showed a spike of 110 units on 2019-01-21, suggesting potential for higher demand in colder months. All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since we are entering August, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime, while the OR backend's service level calculation (q=0.95) will handle protection against stockouts. Pipeline inventory (179) plus current on-hand (79) equals 258 units, which covers approximately 6 weeks of demand at the current average, aligning with the (L+1) coverage goal.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a basic jersey hoodie ('Uno Hood'). Over the last 27 periods, demand has remained consistently stable without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts. The average demand across all historical samples is approximately 44 units per week. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, we have 83 units on-hand and 124 units in-transit (total pipeline of 207). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average of 44 units, needed stock is ~220. The current pipeline of 207 is slightly below this, but given the service level requirements (Profit $19/Holding $1), the OR backend will calculate the necessary refill based on these stable parameters. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to leverage the consistent history and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full stable demand history.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is a basic jersey hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically shows stable demand throughout the year with potential increases as the weather cools in late August/September. Looking at the last 10 periods (P19-P28), demand has averaged 37.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2, showing no significant regime shift from the long-term patterns observed earlier. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the P24 order in P28. Pipeline inventory includes orders from P25 (39), P26 (50), P27 (0), and P28 (76), totaling 165 units. On-hand inventory is 84 units. Given the transition into late August, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the most relevant demand mean and variance for the upcoming weeks while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Uno Hood', a basic hoodie. We are currently in early September (2019/9/2, Period 30). Demand for hoodies typically increases as temperatures drop in autumn. Looking at the history, demand has been stable but showing slight fluctuations around a mean of ~40 units. Recent periods (P25-P29) show demand of 48, 28, 51, 34, 18 (Mean: 35.8). While P29 was low (18), we should anticipate a seasonal uptick or at least maintain coverage for the historical average plus safety stock for the lead time. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory position: On-hand (105) + In-transit (126) = 231. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 231 / 5 = 46.2 units per period, which is slightly above the recent average but aligns well with potential autumn seasonality. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing out the volatility of the last few weeks, and use calculate for L as performance is stable.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Uno Hood', a jersey basic hoodie. Demand has remained remarkably stable throughout the history (Period 1 to Period 30), oscillating generally between 20 and 60 units per week. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 36.2 units, while the lifetime mean is approximately 43 units. There are no immediate significant seasonal spikes identified for early September for this basic item. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). The current inventory position (On-hand: 105, In-transit: 87) is healthy. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=20 will capture the stable demand mean while slightly weighting away from the initial start-up periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a hoodie, a category that typically sees increased demand as the autumn season begins in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand has been stable but shows a slight uptick recently (Period 31 demand was 59). In the last 10 periods (P22-P31), mean demand was 40.6 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) averaged 42.3 units. Given the transition into cooler weather, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect current demand while smoothing volatility, but since we are entering a seasonal peak for hoodies, the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally keep stock levels high. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P30 conclusion showing the P26 order arriving on time). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable lead time history.

In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 28 (arrived), Period 29 (none), Period 30, Period 31, and Period 32. Note: Period 27 had an order of 0. The order from Period 29 was also 0, which explains why no shipment from Period 29 is expected to arrive soon. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent jump in demand (94 units) and the product's seasonal relevance (hoodie in fall), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the upward trend while damping the single outlier of 94. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started Period 32: single-period spike to 94 units coincident with late September date; monitoring for sustained fall seasonality.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a hoodie, entering the peak fall/winter season. A massive demand spike occurred in Period 33 (140 units), following a jump to 94 in Period 32. This represents a significant regime shift compared to the previous average of ~45 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a stock-out state. In-transit inventory (225 units) consists of orders from Periods 30 (11 units), 31 (66 units), 32 (59 units), and 33 (89 units). Based on confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the 11 units from P30 will arrive this period (P34), but will not be visible until the P34 conclude message (at the start of P35). To address the new high-demand regime and recover from the stock-out, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P31-P33: 59, 94, 140) which average ~97.6. Setting L to 4 (promised) as it remains reliable. The recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on this higher-volatility, higher-mean window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Period 32 (94) and Period 33 (140) indicate a shift to a high-demand regime (>100 avg) for the fall season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a zip-up hoodie, which is highly seasonal. We are now in October, and the data from Periods 32 (94 units) and 33 (140 units) confirmed a major seasonal spike in demand. Period 34 showed 74 units, but this was lower than demand likely because the SKU was out of stock (only 11 units available). Given the 'In-transit' quantity of 379 units and current 'On-hand' of 0, we are facing a stockout. My objective is to set parameters that handle this high-demand fall regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus exclusively on the late September/early October surge (avg ~102/period). Calculated over (1+L)=5 periods, this targets a base stock of approximately 510 units. This aggressive posture is necessary to capture the sweatshirt season demand while accounting for the current stockout.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '682550001' (Hoodie) is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter mid-October. Since Period 32, demand has increased from an average of ~45 to an average of ~97.5 (samples: 94, 140, 74, 82). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and lost sales occurred in Periods 33, 34, and 35. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (current period + 4-period lead time). The OR backend uses a base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is ~95%. I will set \u03bc\u0302 using the last 4 periods of high seasonal demand (recent_N=4) to ensure the backend projects the higher forecast across the lead time. I will also use recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 to capture the increased volatility of the fall season, ensuring the order 'cap' and 'base_stock' are sufficiently high to recover from the current stockout.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a confirmed high-demand fall season for the 'Uno Hood' product. Historical demand for the last five periods (P32-P36) has been: 94, 140, 74, 82, 87 (avg \u2248 95.4). Inventory is currently 0 on-hand due to stockouts, with 538 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out, actual demand is likely slightly higher than sales. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture this higher mean of ~95 units per week, which translates to a base stock target covering (1+L=5) weeks of demand (approx 477 units). This targets a high service level given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a zip-up hoodie, which is highly seasonal for the current autumn period (late October). A clear demand regime shift was detected starting Period 32 (previously ~40-50 units, now averaging ~95 units). Recent demand samples are: P32: 94, P33: 140, P34: 74, P35: 82, P36: 87, P37: 96. The average of these 6 samples is 95.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this 'High Demand' regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P33 order arriving exactly in P37. Inventory is currently struggling to meet demand (ending on-hand remains 0 or very low), so I am maintaining a high sigma_hat using the same recent window to account for the increased volatility of this peak season. Setting L=4 (promised) as no drift is observed.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4, 2019. We are in a high-demand fall season for the hoodie SKU. Analyzing demand since the shift in Period 32, we have observations of 94, 140, 74, 82, 87, 96, and 83. The average demand over these 7 periods is approximately 93.7 units. The Period 33 spike (140) was an outlier, while subsequent demand has stabilized between 74 and 96. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this seasonal level (mean ~94) and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the variance from this shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every recent arrival (P34 arrived in P38, P33 in P37, etc.), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. We finally have positive ending inventory (82 units) after four periods of stockouts, but with a large pipeline (398 units) and lead time of 4, our base stock calculation [ (1+L) * mean ] will properly throttle orders while maintaining service levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the fall season for a hoodie SKU, which previously saw a demand spike starting around Period 32 (September). However, the last two weeks (P38: 83, P39: 48) show a cooling from the peak (P33: 140, P37: 96). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P32-P39) is approximately 88.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P38 and P39). With 193 units on hand and 308 in-transit (P36, P37, P38, P39 orders), our pipeline is significant. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods to capture the sustained higher fall demand while acknowledging the recent slight softening, ensuring we cover the (L+1) period window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41 (mid-November). The product is a hoodie, which experienced a seasonal demand spike starting around Period 32 (late September) as expected for fall weather. Demand shifted from a mean of ~45 to over 100 units/period, but has moderated slightly in the most recent three periods (48, 68 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 250 units on-hand and 217 in-transit, we are well-stocked to handle current demand levels. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand (covering the period since the late-September shift) to capture the high-demand regime while reflecting the recent slight cooling. This balances readiness for late fall demand against the risk of high holding costs if demand returns to baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak between Period 32 (mid-September) and Period 38 (late October), with demand consistently above 80 units and peaking at 140. However, the last three periods (39, 40, 41) show a cooling trend with demand falling to 48, 68, and 32 units respectively. This suggests the primary fall peak for this hoodie SKU is passing or stabilizing at a lower level as we head into late November. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (253 units) with 237 units still in transit, primarily due to large orders placed during the peak. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels for potential late-holiday demand, I will transition to a more recent demand window (N=10) which captures both the peak and the recent decline, providing a balanced mu_hat. I'll use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat as well to account for the high volatility observed during the seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Following the fall peak (P32-P38 avg ~95), demand has decreased over P39-P41 (avg ~49), suggesting the seasonal spike is concluding.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand analysis shows the fall seasonal peak (Period 32-38, avg ~95) has concluded. Over the last four periods (P39-P42), demand has averaged 55 units (48, 68, 32, 72), confirming a return to a lower, post-peak regime. With On-hand inventory at 260 and In-transit at 178 (total 438), we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels (5 periods * ~55 = 275). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current post-peak demand level (~55 units/period) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the volatility in this transition. This will signal the OR engine to minimize further orders while we bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Period 39-42 average is 55 units, returning to pre-seasonal levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. Demand analysis shows that the seasonal fall peak (Periods 32-38, avg ~95) has concluded. The last 5 periods (P39-P43) show an average demand of 49.6 units, returning to the pre-seasonal baseline (approx 45-50 units). On-hand inventory is high at 301 units, which comfortably covers more than 6 periods of expected demand at current rates. Given that we are late in the year and demand has softened, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-peak mean and volatility accurately while preventing excessive safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow on-hand inventory to bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-16 (Period 45). The fall seasonal peak (Period 32-38) is over. Demand in the most recent periods (P39-P44) has stabilized around an average of 49 units, confirming a return to the pre-seasonal baseline. On-hand inventory is currently high (289 units), which exceeds the estimated demand for the remaining periods of the game (total periods 47). Specifically, with a lead time of 4, orders placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game end. Even if they arrived earlier, the inventory on hand + in-transit (Total=364) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the final 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) at the current rate (~50/period). To maximize profit and minimize holding costs on excess stock at the game's end, the parameters are set to a 'recent_N' approach where N=6 (capturing the post-peak regime) to reflect the current lower demand level. High on-hand inventory should trigger a zero order from the OR backend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic Hoodie' peaked in Oct/Nov and has since stabilized in a post-peak regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P39-P45) has averaged 51 units, which aligns with the pre-seasonal average from early 2019. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With 280 units on-hand and only 20 units in-transit, the current inventory is quite high relative to the stabilized demand (covering ~5.5 periods). I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the post-peak demand level and allow the OR backend to naturally cycle down the excess inventory while maintaining a safe stock level for the current regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, moving into the post-holiday/New Year period. Analysis of the demand history confirms that the fall/winter seasonal peak (Periods 32-38) has subsided. Demand over the last 8 periods (P39-P46) has averaged 48.1 units, closely aligning with the pre-seasonal 'stable' regime of ~45-50 units identified in Period 6. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 273), which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand while we return to a steady-state rhythm. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple recent arrivals). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this post-peak stabilization and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the high-demand spikes seen in September/October.
