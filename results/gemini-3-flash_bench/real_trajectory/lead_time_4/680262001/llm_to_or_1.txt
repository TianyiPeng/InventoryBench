Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a rising demand trend: 292, 300, 355, 391, then a slight dip to 372. The average demand across these 5 weeks is approximately 324 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 44 units. The product is 'SUPREME tights' (Ladies H&M Sport). Given we are in mid-February, we are likely entering the spring fitness season, which explains the upward trend compared to early January. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no lead time history yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 samples (355, 391, 372) average ~373 units, which better represents the current regime than the full history (average 324). I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*373 = 1865. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the recent 5-sample standard deviation (~44) scaled: sqrt(5)*44 \u2248 98. This covers the (L+1) horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a functional sportswear item. Historical demand shows a steady upward trend through January and early February (292, 300, 355, 391, 372). In Period 1, observed demand was 325, though 0 were sold due to zero starting inventory. Promised lead time is 4. An order of 446 was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; per rules, even with L=4, we won't see arrival confirmation until Period 6. Given the dates, we are moving deeper into the spring workout season, and demand is relatively stable but high. I will set mu_hat based on the average demand of the most recent 6 samples (including Period 1) to capture this level. Sigma_hat is set using default to account for the variance across all known samples.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) showed a mean of ~344 units. However, recent periods (P1 and P2) show realized demand of 325 and 421 (avg 373), indicating a moderate upward trend perhaps linked to the transition into March and increased fitness activity (SUPREME tights). Our On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in significant lost sales in P1 and P2 because the promised lead time is 4. Given the lead time L=4, my parameters must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (including the 5 pre-game samples) to capture the slightly higher demand average while smoothing noise. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods (421 vs 325). No arrivals are expected yet, as orders from P1 and P2 have lead times of 4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'SUPREME tights' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (446 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for the first three periods. Demand has shown an upward trend compared to the initial January samples, averaging 370 units over the last 3 periods (325, 421, 366) versus 344 in January. Given the product type (Sports tights) and the date (early March), we are entering a peak fitness/spring season where demand typically rises or stays elevated. Since actual lead time cannot be confirmed yet (no arrivals), I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher post-January activity level. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 of the simulation for 'SUPREME tights'. The product is a functional sportswear item, and we are in early March. Historical demand samples (pre-game) showed a slight upward trend (292 to 372), and in-game demand (Periods 1-4) has remained relatively stable (avg \u2248 356). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at the start of Period 5, we have not yet observed any arrivals (the order from P1 is scheduled to arrive DURING Period 5 and will be visible in the P6 conclude message). Consequently, we have been stock-out for 4 periods because we started with 0 inventory. There is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time exceeds 4 or that shipments are lost. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the in-game demand average of 356.75, which is slightly higher than the pre-game mean. Lead time L will remain at default (4). Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=4) to capture current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a functional sport item. Historical demand from the initial samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 344 units. Recent demand (Feb-Mar) has fluctuated, but the average across the 5 concluded periods is 336.4 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P1-P5) were [325, 421, 366, 315, 255], showing some recent softening. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the arrival in P5 (ordered P1) confirms an actual lead time of 4. Currently, on-hand is 191 and in-transit is 1429 (representing orders from P2-P5). Since 4 periods of demand + 1 review period demand (approx 5 * 336 = 1680) is barely covered by current inventory (191) + pipeline (1429) = 1620, we need to maintain consistent ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent slight decline while maintaining a robust base, and 'default' for lead time as 'actual' matches 'promised'.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Looking at the history, demand was high in February (Avg ~376 for P1-P4) but has notably decreased in March (Avg ~243 for P5-P6). This aligns with a potential post-New Year fitness resolution surge fading. Inventory is finally flowing in; orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods. With 364 units on hand and 1203 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6), we are well-covered. To account for the recent lower demand and avoid high holding costs ($1/unit), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 to capture the March trend (P4-P6). I will use the default lead time (4) as arrivals have been consistent with the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: weekly demand dropped from ~376 (P1-P4) to ~243 (P5-P6), a ~35% decrease coinciding with late March seasonality for sports tights.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the demand for the SUPREME sports tights (680262001) has stabilized at a lower level following a regime shift that started in March. The demand for the last three periods (P5-P7) was 255, 232, and 226, yielding a mean of 237.7 units per week. This is significantly lower than the ~350-400 range seen in February. We are currently well-stocked with 571 on-hand units and 770 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6), which should cover demand for the next 5-6 periods at the current rate. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance and use 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align order logic with the current lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, given the high in-transit volume and current on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8th. The product is sports tights. We have observed a stable demand regime change since Period 5 (coinciding with the end of the peak early-year fitness season). The average demand for the last four periods (P5-P8) is approximately 235 units, compared to the initial five weeks of history and P1-P4 which averaged ~350. On-hand inventory is high (793) plus in-transit stock ordered in periods 5 and 6 (141 + 179 = 320), totaling 1113 units against a weekly demand trend of ~235. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand stock and a lower sustained demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock reflects the lower current demand, preventing further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting in Period 5 (early March), where weekly demand dropped from ~350+ to an average of ~225. The most recent three periods (P7-P9) show a further decline (226, 228, 183), with the latest demand being significantly lower. This aligns with post-peak seasonality for sports tights in the spring. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). On-hand inventory is currently high (751), and there are 268 units in-transit (orders from P6 and P9). Given the lower demand regime (~212 avg over P5-P9), the pipeline and on-hand inventory are currently over-supplying for a (L+1)=5 period horizon. To capture this shift, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-March demand levels, and 'calculate' for lead time since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 9: Average weekly demand for P5-P9 is approximately 225 units, down ~40% from the initial period (P1-P4). Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-400.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'SUPREME tights' are experiencing a significant demand decline. Initial demand (P1-P4) averaged ~357 units/week, but the most recent period (P10) dropped to 106 units. The average for the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is approximately 195 units/week. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (824 units) and 244 units in-transit (P9 & P10 orders), the current stock covers over 5 weeks of demand at current rates. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the downward trend in demand and volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Continued demand decline: P10 demand reached a new low of 106. The 5-period average (P6-P10) is now 195 units, significantly below the P1-P4 baseline of 357 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' continues its significant downward trend, dropping to 90 units in Period 11, following a low of 106 in Period 10. This confirms a post-winter/spring-entry seasonal decline. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is 126.33 units, which is much lower than the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. Current inventory (On-hand: 734, In-transit: 252, Total: 986) is extremely high relative to current demand, meaning the system is overstocked. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and stop unnecessary ordering, I am updating mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand environment. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Severe demand decline confirmed: average demand dropped to ~126 units (P9-P11), a ~65% decrease from the P1-P4 baseline (~357). Significant overstock condition exists.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), demand for SUPREME sports tights continues to be in a significantly lower regime compared to the start of the year. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 138.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 559 units, with 252 units in transit (concluding P9, P10, and P11 orders). Total pipeline inventory is 811 units. Given the lead time (L=4), we want to cover demand for 5 periods. At the current mean of ~139, the required base stock is approximately 695 units. Since we have 811 units in the pipeline, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from placing further orders and to minimize holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current low demand level and set L to default (4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility accurately.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The SKU (sports tights) has entered a sustained low-demand regime, likely due to the end of the peak spring fitness season. Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged approximately 134 units (183, 106, 90, 175, 114), a significant drop from the early-year average of ~340. The current on-hand inventory is 534 units, which is approximately 4 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. In-transit inventory of 163 units (from P10 and P11) is expected to arrive in P14 and P15. Combined, the total inventory position (697) supports over 5 weeks of demand, well above the required base stock level for a 4-period lead time given the low demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to prevent over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~134 units/week (P9-P13), representing a ~60% reduction from the P1-P4 baseline. This level has been consistent for 5 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'SUPREME tights' (680262001) is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime as May continues, consistent with a post-spring sport season cooling. Demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has averaged approximately 132 units/week (183, 106, 90, 175, 114, 124). Current on-hand inventory is 565 units, which covers over 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P13 and P14). Since on-hand (565) + in-transit (59) = 624 units already exceeds the likely pipeline requirement (target base stock for L+1=5 weeks \u2248 5 * 132 = 660, before safety stock), no large orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this stabilized low-demand level and rely on 'calculate' for lead time to maintain the 4-period observed average. High on-hand inventory minimizes stockout risk despite the low mu_hat.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '680262001' (Supreme Tights) continues to display a stabilized demand regime significantly below its Q1 baseline. Current demand (P11-P15) averages ~128 units/week, consistent with the documented regime shift around Period 9. The on-hand inventory (435) plus in-transit stock (159, totaling 594 units) is extremely high relative to current demand, representing over 4.5 weeks of supply. Since the actual lead time L remains consistently at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent excessive ordering while the system works through this overstock. I am using mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P9-P15) to capture the stabilized low-demand regime (~132 units/week), and recent_N for sigma to account for the reduced volatility in this period. Setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for SUPREME sports tights has stabilized significantly below the initial Q1 peak. Average demand over the last 8 periods (P9-P16) is 127.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~350+. Although the latest period saw a low of 93 units, the 120-130 range is a reliable recent average. On-hand inventory (342) plus in-transit (295) equals 637 units. At an estimated demand of ~130/week, this covers roughly 4.9 weeks of supply. Given the consistent 4-period lead time, we are currently slightly oversupplied relative to the (L+1=5) period horizon, but since on-hand is dropping, we need to maintain a steady flow. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable, low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time calculation remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average weekly demand from P9 to P16 has consolidated around 128 units, reflecting 8 periods of consistent performance post-seasonal drop.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' remains in the low-volume regime identified since Period 9. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) is approximately 113 units, with the most recent three periods (P15-P17) even lower at ~106 units. The product is a seasonal functional sport item, and demand has significantly cooled since the spring peak. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as evidenced by P15 conclude showing P11's order arriving). On-hand inventory is 256 and in-transit is 364 (total pipeline = 620). With a current weekly mean of ~113, the pipeline covers over 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable low regime since P9) to align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the current sustained lower demand levels, preventing further overstock while maintaining enough inventory for the lead time plus current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized: Average weekly demand from P9 to P17 (9 periods) is 113 units, showing a continued slight downward drift from the previous 128 unit average.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has stabilized at a lower level following a seasonal peak earlier in the year. The average weekly demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 108 units. Recent demand has drifted slightly lower, with Period 18 showing 74 units. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the Period 14 order arriving exactly 4 periods later in Period 18). My current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 610 units (233 + 377), which covers significantly more than the (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand at the current average (108 * 5 = 540). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the established lower-demand regime while maintaining a responsive buffer. This choice allows the OR backend to continue working through the existing excess inventory while preparing to place appropriately sized replacement orders once the pipeline draws down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average weekly demand from P9 to P18 has consolidated at 108 units, consistent with low summer seasonality for this SKU. Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has continued to decline throughout the summer, reaching a new low of 46 units in Period 19. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P9-P19) is approximately 111 units, but more importantly, the last 4 periods (P16-P19) show a lower average of ~75 units. This suggests either a deep summer trough or a continued downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P18 and P19 both confirmed 4 periods). On-hand inventory (295) and In-transit (321) total 616 units, which at current demand rates covers nearly 8 weeks of supply. To avoid further overstock and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining a service level for the $4 profit, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture this latest demand dip. This ensures the OR backend does not place significant new orders while current inventory is winding down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened starting Period 16: avg weekly demand dropped from ~134 (P9-P13) to ~75 (P16-P19), suggesting a mid-summer seasonal low.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are observing a significant mid-summer demand decline for the SKU (Supreme Tights). Average weekly demand has dropped from ~134 (P9-P13) to approximately 66 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with the most recent week hitting a low of 31 units. The target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80 suggests a lean inventory posture. Current on-hand inventory (400) plus in-transit stock (185) totals 585 units, which is extremely high (nearly 9 weeks of coverage at current demand rates). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. To minimize holding costs while the backend handles the order capping, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current trough in demand and use calculate for lead time to maintain the 4-period baseline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand from P16-P20 has fallen to ~66 units, a ~50% drop from the late-spring average (~130 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' (sports leggings) has continued its deep mid-summer descent. Specifically, weekly demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) has dropped to 46, 31, and 29 units respectively, confirming a low-season trough significantly below the late-spring base. The current on-hand inventory of 440 units, combined with an in-transit pipeline of 116 units (totaling 556 units), is extremely high relative to the current average demand of ~35 units/week. At this rate, the available inventory covers over 15 weeks of demand, far exceeding the lead time requirements. Historically, lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Given the $1.00/unit/period holding cost, I need to prevent additional ordering to mitigate further overstock. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (N=5 for the mid-summer regime: P17-P21) which averages ~53 units/week. This will lower the OR backend's target base stock and ensure no new orders are placed until the current inventory is significantly drawn down.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough deepened further (P19-P21): Average weekly demand over the last 3 periods has dropped to ~35 units, representing a ~70% decrease from the late-spring regime (~130 units) and a ~90% decrease from the P1-P4 baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The demand for product 680262001 (sports tights) has reached a seasonal trough, consistent with mid-summer behavior for this category. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged approximately 35 units per week (46, 31, 29, 33). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 471 units, which is enough to cover over 13 weeks of current demand levels. The pipeline contains 52 units (ordered P19, expected to arrive P23). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, maintaining such a massive surplus is detrimental to the total reward R_t. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the most current demand regime (~35 units/week) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P14-P18 exactly 4 periods after ordering. The OR engine's base_stock calculation with these parameters will result in zero orders until the current overstock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough stabilized (P19-P22): Average weekly demand is 35 units, a ~70% drop from late-spring and ~90% drop from the start of the year.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the peak of the mid-summer season for sports tights. Examining the demand history, we observe a steady and significant decline from the start of the year (~350 units/week) to the recent mid-summer trough. The four most recent weekly demand figures are 31, 29, 33, and 15, yielding an average of approximately 27 units. This confirms the 'mid-summer demand trough' identified in previous carry-over insights. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 508 units, which is exceptionally high relative to the current demand rate (sufficient to cover approximately 18 periods of demand). With a lead time of 4 periods and zero in-transit units, the primary objective is to avoid adding to this overstock. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (reflecting the stabilized low demand) and use default sigma. Since on-hand inventory (508) is far greater than the computed base stock (which would be roughly (1+4) * 27 = 135 plus safety stock), the OR backend will correctly result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand from P20-P23 has dropped to ~27 units, a further decline from the already low late-spring average.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 680262001 (sports tights) has entered a deep mid-summer trough. Current on-hand inventory is 496 units, while the average weekly demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 24 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock aims to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At current demand levels, 5 periods of demand would be approximately 120 units. Since current on-hand inventory (496) significantly exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture this seasonal low. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand for P20-P24 is ~24 units, reflecting the seasonal low for sports tights.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product (sports tights) is in a significant mid-summer demand trough, with weekly demand averaging only ~21 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 29, 33, 15, 12, 12). There is a massive overstock situation with 484 units on hand, which is enough to cover over 20 weeks of demand at current rates. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the extreme overstock, the goal is to prevent any further ordering until inventory levels are naturally depleted by the low seasonal demand. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current trough, although the OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders due to high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand for P21-P25 is ~20 units, reflecting a ~95% decrease from the P1-P4 baseline. On-hand inventory is extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The SKU (sports tights) is in a significant mid-summer demand trough, with weekly demand averaging approximately 13 units over the last three periods (P24-P26), which is a ~96% decrease from the initial Q1 baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 471 units, while the projected demand for the review and lead time periods (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 65 units. Consequently, the system is severely overstocked. No orders have been placed since Period 19, and pipeline inventory is now zero. I will continue to use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the shift from late July through early August) to reflect this low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is sports tights, which reached a seasonal low in July/August with weekly demand averaging ~15 units. The most recent demand (P27) was 22, slightly up from the P23-P26 average of ~12, but still extremely low. With 449 units on-hand and zero demand growth evidence yet to justify new orders (as 449 units covers over 20 weeks of current demand), the priority remains inventory depletion. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set using N=5 to reflect the current trough of ~14.4 units per week [(15+12+12+13+22)/5]. Parameters are defensive to prevent any further ordering until the overstock is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough appears to have bottomed out between P23-P26 at ~12 units/week; P27 showed a slight increase to 22 units, but overall demand remains ~95% below the P1-P4 baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Supreme tights' is currently in a deep seasonal trough during August. Weekly demand has consistently stayed below 25 units for the last 6 periods (P23-P28), with the most recent demand at 15 units. The current on-hand inventory of 434 units is extremely high, covering over 17 weeks of demand at the current rate (avg ~25 units/week). There is zero in-transit inventory, which is appropriate given the overstock. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize the base stock to prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate. I will use the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to reflect this seasonal bottom accurately.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough appears to have bottomed out between P23-P28 at an average of ~15 units/week, representing a ~95% decrease from the Q1 baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '680262001' (SUPREME sports tights) is currently deep in a low-demand seasonal trough, likely due to the summer season ending and the lead-up to early autumn. Analysis of the recent history (P23-P29) shows demand has bottomed out and stabilized around an average of 15.1 units per week. Specifically, demand in the last five periods (P25-P29) was 12, 13, 22, 15, 16. The current on-hand inventory is 418 units, which, at the current consumption rate, covers over 25 periods of demand\u2014far exceeding the lead time requirements. There are no units in-transit. Given the high Holding Cost ($1.0) relative to Profit ($4.0) and the massive overstock, the priority is to prevent any further ordering by maintaining parameters reflective of this low-demand regime. Using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 captures the stable trough period (P23-P29). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed stable from P23-P29: average weekly demand is ~15 units, indicating no recovery yet from the seasonal low.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for sports tights remains in a profound seasonal trough, with the most recent demand (Period 30) dropping to 8 units. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P23-P30) is approximately 14 units per week, which is a ~96% decrease from the early-year baseline. On-hand inventory stands at 410 units, which, at current demand rates, represents over 25 weeks of supply. This is far in excess of the lead-time requirement (L=4). Since lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P23-P27 confirms no unexpected delays), and the system is significantly overstocked, I will continue to order 0 units by setting demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and keeping L at the promised lead time. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) >> (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) and naturally place a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed stable from P23-P30: average weekly demand is ~14 units, showing no signs of autumnal recovery yet for sports tights.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for sports tights has remained in a deep seasonal trough since Period 23 (early August), with weekly demand averaging approximately 14 units (P23-P31). The on-hand inventory is currently 400 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers roughly 28 weeks of sales\u2014far exceeding the lead time plus review period (5 weeks). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to continue providing accurate, low demand forecasts to the OR engine to prevent any new orders until the significant overstock is cleared. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (P23-P31) to capture this stable, low-demand regime. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, ensuring no fresh capital is tied up in excess stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are analyzing 'SUPREME tights', a sports garment. Historical demand has been in a sustained seasonal trough since late July (Period 24 onwards), with weekly demand fluctuating between 8 and 22 units. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) is approximately 14.3 units. We currently hold 388 units on-hand with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, this inventory represents over 25 weeks of supply, which is far beyond the (L+1) requirement of 5 weeks. Although we expect an autumnal recovery for sports tights as weather cools, there is no numerical evidence of a demand uptick in the P32 concluding data (12 units). Given the massive overstock and $1.00/unit/period holding cost, the OR backend must continue to suppress ordering. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level remains well below the current 388 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the seasonal trough: average weekly demand from P23 to P32 is 14.3 units, significantly below the spring/summer levels. No autumnal recovery detected as of P32.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '680262001' (Supreme tights) remains in a prolonged seasonal demand trough. Period 33 demand was 9 units, and the average since Period 23 (when the trough stabilized) is approximately 13.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 379 units, which at the current depletion rate, covers over 27 weeks of demand. We are currently at Period 34 (late September), and while an autumnal recovery for sports apparel is possible, it has not yet materialized in the data. With zero in-transit units and nearly 400 on-hand, there is no risk of stockout. The priority remains reducing high holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods (P23-P33) to accurately reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend identifies the significant overstock and does not place new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough persists through Period 33: average weekly demand (P23-P33) is ~14 units, showing no significant autumnal recovery as of late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. We are still in a deep demand trough for 'Sports tights', with demand averaging ~14 units over the last 12 periods (P23-P34). Despite entering October, no autumnal recovery is visible yet. On-hand inventory is 370 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~10-15 units/week, represents over 20 weeks of stock. Since the lead time is 4 periods and the target inventory level (base stock) based on current demand would be significantly lower than 370, we must continue to avoid ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 periods to accurately reflect this low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from generating unnecessary orders while we burn through excess stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand for sports tights continues to be in a severe seasonal trough. The average demand over the last 13 periods (P23-P35) is approximately 13 units per week, with Period 35 hitting a low of 5 units. On-hand inventory is 365 units, which provides over 28 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent confirmed arrivals (P19 order arrived P23). Given the extreme overstock (365 units vs. a 5-period demand requirement of ~65 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13) to reflect the current low-demand regime (P23-P35) to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed stable from P23-P35: average weekly demand is ~13 units, with no sign of autumnal recovery as of mid-October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Supreme tights' continues to experience its seasonal demand trough, with weekly demand reaching a new low of 5 units in the last two periods (P35-P36). The average demand over the last 14 periods (P23-P36) is approximately 11.6 units per week. The current date is October 21st, and while autumn/winter typically sees a rise in indoor fitness or layering demand, there is no evidence of this shift yet in the sales data. Current on-hand inventory is 360 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~12 units/week, represents approximately 30 weeks of stock. Since the game ends in Period 47 (11 periods away), the current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Thus, no new orders are required. I will continue to use recent_N for mu_hat (N=14) and sigma_hat (N=14) to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on high Q1 historical data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at seasonal trough through Period 36: average weekly demand (P23-P36) is ~12 units, with most recent weeks (P35-P36) showing only 5 units/week. No seasonal recovery for sports tights detected yet.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' remains in a deep seasonal trough that began in mid-summer. The average weekly demand from Period 23 to Period 37 (15 periods) is approximately 11.5 units. Recent demand (P35-P37) is even lower, averaging 6 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 352 units and a pipeline of 0, the current stock covers approximately 30 periods of demand at the current trough rate. No autumnal recovery has been detected yet, although seasonal knowledge suggests sales for sports tights might eventually pick up as indoor fitness activities increase in late Q4. Given the massive overstock (holding cost of $352/period vs. potential profit of $4/unit), the priority remains to avoid any further ordering. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture the sustained trough and a recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to default as recent arrivals confirmed the promised 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough remains stable and deep through Period 37: average weekly demand (P23-P37) is ~11.5 units, which is ~97% below the P1-P4 baseline. No Q4 recovery observed as of late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. Historical demand analysis confirms the SKU '680262001' (sports tights) remains in a deep seasonal trough that began around Period 23. Average weekly demand from P23 to P38 is approximately 11.5 units, which is a ~97% reduction from the early Q1 baseline. The most recent four periods (P35-P38) show even lower activity, averaging just 6.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 343 units, which provides over 30 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, parameters are set to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable trough period). No new orders are expected or required given the significant overstock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40). Historical demand for these sports tights has remained in a deep seasonal trough since approximately Period 23 (early July). Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged only ~8 units per week (min 5, max 12), which is roughly 97% lower than the Q1 average. Despite approaching late autumn/winter, there is still no signal of recovery in demand. With 337 units on-hand and an average weekly demand of ~8 units, the current inventory is sufficient for over 40 weeks, far exceeding the remaining 8 periods of the game. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 'default' of 4, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to reflect this persistent low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand remains in a deep seasonal trough for sports tights, with incredibly low volume. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), weekly demand has averaged 6.8 units (5, 8, 9, 6, 6). The on-hand inventory of 331 units is equivalent to nearly 48 weeks of supply at this current rate. This creates a severe overstock situation, especially with the game ending at Period 47. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize high holding costs ($1/unit/period), mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect this currently very low demand regime. Given the massive inventory surplus, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in an order of 0 units, as the base stock target will be far below current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stagnant at ~7 units/week through Period 40; extremely high inventory (331 units) ensures no ordering will be required for the remainder of the game.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the SKU remains in a severe demand trough which began in mid-summer. Weekly demand has averaged roughly 7 units over the last five periods (P37-P41), and current on-hand inventory is 327 units. With any reasonable lead time (promised is 4) and extremely low demand, the current stock is sufficient to cover more than 40 weeks of sales, which far exceeds the remaining 5 periods of the game. Consequently, no new orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect this persistent low-demand regime: L remains at the default (4), mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=20 to capture the long-term stable low demand (approx. 11 units/week * 5 periods), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=20 to reflect the current low volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). The game ends at Period 47. Current on-hand inventory is 324 units, while the average weekly demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) has dropped to approximately 6.4 units per week. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P43 to P47) and a stable lead time of 4 periods, total expected demand for the rest of the simulation is approximately 32 units. Our current inventory is more than ten times the required stock to cover all remaining demand. The primary objective is to minimize holding costs by not adding any more inventory to the pipeline. I will continue to set parameters to ensure the OR backend generates an order of 0, effectively liquidating the massive overstock position while maintaining a 100% service level for the few remaining sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an annual low in late Q4 (P41-P42), averaging ~3.5 units/week, significantly lower than the P23-P30 trough of ~14 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The seasonal demand for sports tights has reached an extreme annual low, with the most recent three periods (P41-P43) averaging only 3.67 units/week. This is a significant further decline from the previous trough of ~14 units/week. There is currently an massive overstock situation with 320 units on-hand and zero in-transit inventory. Given the extremely low demand relative to stock, no further ordering is necessary or desired for the remaining periods of the game (up to Period 47). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this most recent demand floor and ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders as inventory slowly depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an annual floor in Dec (P41-P43) at ~3.7 units/week, down from the P23-P30 trough of ~14 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-285.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the game's end at Period 47. The current on-hand inventory is 313 units, while the recent demand (P41-P44) has dropped to an average of just 4.5 units per week. This inventory level is sufficient to cover more than 60 weeks of current demand, which far exceeds the remaining 3 periods of the simulation. No further orders are necessary. To ensure the OR backend does not place any orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current extremely low demand floor, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 4. Since the lead time + review period (L+1=5) exceeds the remaining periods, the existing inventory will more than suffice to maximize profit and minimize additional holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46), approaching the end of the 47-period horizon. The SKU (sports tights) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since late Q2, with demand further bottoming out to ~4 units per week in November and December. Current on-hand inventory is 310 units, which, at the current demand rate of roughly 4 units/week, represents over 70 weeks of supply. Since there are only 2 periods remaining in the game and inventory is massively excessive, no replenishment is needed. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders, although the high on-hand balance ensures 'final order' will be 0 regardless.

Carry-over insight: Annual demand floor confirmed in Q4 (P41-P45) at ~4.2 units/week, reinforcing the deep seasonal trough for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-300.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final decision period. The SKU 680262001 (sports tights) has spent most of the year in a deep seasonal trough. Demand has further declined in December, with the last 6 weeks (P41-P46) averaging approximately 3.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 308 units, which is enough to cover over a year of demand at this current rate. To avoid incurring further holding costs and maximize profit for the final period, the goal is to prevent any new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period window to reflect the current floor demand (~5 units/week across 1+L periods), which, combined with the massive on-hand inventory, will naturally result in a zero order from the OR backend.
