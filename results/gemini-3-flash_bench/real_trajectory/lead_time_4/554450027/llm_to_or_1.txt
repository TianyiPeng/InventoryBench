Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple wardrobe item (superstretch washed denim). Historical demand samples from Jan/Feb 2019 show a mean of 130.8 and a standard deviation of 22.3 across 5 weeks. There is a slight upward trend from Jan (132, 100, 122) into Feb (148, 152), likely reflecting the build-up to the Spring season. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period with no prior arrivals or lead-time history, I will use 'default' for L to align with the promised 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history which shows the current upward trajectory. The OR backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) * mean and sqrt(1+L) * std, ensuring we cover demand during the 4-period lead time plus the current review period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny denim trouser. Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) was: 132, 100, 122, 148, 152. Period 1 demand was 163. The mean demand of these 6 samples is approximately 136.17. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 166 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1, expected to arrive in Period 5). Period 1 demand (163) resulted in 163 lost sales because of 0 starting inventory. Since the demand shows a slight upward trend reaching 163 in the most recent period, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. L is set to 'default' as we have no information yet to suggest actual lead time differs from promised.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history for this denim SKU (554450027) shows values of 132, 100, 122, 148, 152 (pre-game) and 163, 127 (Periods 1-2). The mean demand across these 7 samples is approximately 135. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (166 units) and P2 (174 units) are currently in-transit (total 340) and are expected to arrive in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. We are currently experiencing a stockout (On-hand: 0) because starting inventory was 0 and the lead time hasn't elapsed. To calculate mu_hat, I will use all 7 available samples (N=7) to establish a stable baseline for this 'Divided Collection' item. The average demand is ~135, and with L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods, totaling ~675. Since the OR engine calculates this automatically with 'recent_N', I will set N=7. Sigma is similarly calculated to handle the observed volatility (std dev ~22).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 554450027 is a pair of Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS. We are currently in Period 4 (early March). Demand history shows 132, 100, 122, 148, 152 in the pre-game samples, followed by 163, 127, and 91 in the first three periods. Demand appears to be cooling slightly from a Feb peak but remains significant. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the order placed in Period 1 (166 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in Period 6. Currently, 510 units are in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 4, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 (capturing the most recent 3 game periods plus the last 2 pre-game samples) to balance the recent slowdown with earlier data. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods, as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture full historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a staple item (superstretch skinny jeans). Historically, we've seen demand samples ranging from 89 to 163 units per week. The mean of all 10 available samples (5 pre-game, 4 in-game) is approximately 130 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we started with 0 inventory and L=4, we expect our first order (placed in P1) to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations so far are consistent with L=4. We currently have 688 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 166+174+170+178). To maintain stock once arrivals begin, we set mu_hat based on the mean of all samples (recent_N=10) to reflect the 130 avg demand. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to cover volatility. L is set to default as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2094.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the first order from Period 1 has arrived after the promised lead time of 4 periods (arrived in Period 5 conclusion). This confirms the actual lead time L=4. The item is a 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Historical demand samples (132, 100, 122, 148, 152) and recent observed demand (163, 127, 91, 89, 113) show some volatility but generally oscillate around a mean of ~120-130. The average of the 10 available demand data points is 123.7. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the most recent demand trend (avg = 116.6) while L=4 is confirmed. Standard deviation will be calculated using all 10 samples to ensure enough data for a robust safety stock, as recent demand has been slightly more volatile.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Average demand across all 10 periods (historical + observed) is approx 123.7 units/week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. In-transit arrivals for P3 and P4 are expected in P7 and P8. Historical demand (5 samples) mean was 130.8. Observed demand (P1-P6) has been: 163, 127, 91, 89, 113, 78. Total mean of all 11 samples is 115.5. Recent demand in the last 4 periods (P3-P6) shows a downward shift to 92.75 units/week. Since the product is a staple (Julia RW Skinny Denim), we shouldn't overreact to a few weeks of low demand, but we should reflect the softening trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent trend while maintaining a reasonable sample size, and default lead time calculation since it matches promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand dropped from 130.8 (historical) to approx 93 units over the last 4 periods (P3-P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a item with steady demand but currently showing a downward trend. Historical demand (pre-game) averaged ~131, while recent demand (Periods 1-7) has averaged ~105, with the last four periods (P4-P7) even lower at ~89. This softening of demand, as noted in the carry-over insights, needs to be reflected to avoid overstocking. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). With on-hand inventory at 244 and 281 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, and P6), we have ample coverage. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~88.8) while still maintaining a reasonable safety buffer through the standard backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Last 5 observed periods (P3-P7) average 89.2 units, down from historical 130.8 (-32%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is Julia RW Skinny Denim, which is a staple item but showing a clear demand shift. Historical demand was approx 130.8 units, but the last 6 observed periods (P3-P8) have averaged 90.6 units (91, 89, 113, 78, 75, 98), confirming a significant softening (-31%). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, and P8 concludes). Currently, we have 324 units on-hand and 103 in-transit (from P5 and P6 orders). Total pipeline is 427 units. With a lead time of 4, our base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~91 units/week, 5 periods requirement is ~455 units. Given we have 427 units in the system and demand has been lower recently, the OR backend will likely order very little or zero to avoid excess holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Period 3 through Period 8 average demand is 90.7 units, representing a sustained ~31% decrease from the historical mean of 130.8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is skin-tight denim trousers from the 'Divided' collection (targeting younger fashion shoppers). Demand has shifted significantly downward since Period 3. Prior to Period 3, demand averaged around 130+ units; from Period 3 to Period 9 (7 periods), the average demand is 86.7 units. The carry-over insights confirm this sustained ~30% drop. L=4 is well-established as the actual lead time (matching promised). Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P6 (67 units) and P9 (78 units), totaling 145 units. On-hand is 297 units. With (L+1) = 5 periods of desired coverage and an average demand of ~87, the target base stock is approximately 435 units (plus safety stock). Current inventory (297) + pipeline (145) = 442 units, which is slightly above the expected needs. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' continues to show a sustained downward trend. The historical mean (pre-game) was 130.8. Over the last 8 observed periods (P3-P10), demand has averaged 83.1 units. The most recent 4 periods (P7-P10) show an even lower average of 73.5 units. Given that on-hand inventory (306) and in-transit (130) units provide high coverage relative to this softening demand, I am adjusting the forecasting period (N) to 8 to capture the full scope of the lower demand regime while avoiding over-reliance on the extremely low most recent weeks. This will help the OR backend lower the base stock level gradually, reducing holding costs without risking stockouts should demand stabilize. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Periods 3-10 average is 83.1 units, a ~36% reduction from historical levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is skin-tight denim trousers. Looking at the demand history, there's a clear downward trend from the historical average (~130) to a more recent regime (P3-P11) averaging approximately 78 units per week. The last period demand (P11) was 47 units, the lowest yet. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple successful deliveries (P5-P10). Currently, on-hand (259) and in-transit (177) inventory totals 436 units. This level is quite high given the recent demand drop (436 / ~78 \u2248 5.6 periods of cover), but the OR engine's capped policy will manage the actual order amount. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P3-P11) to capture the lower demand regime accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period lead time is consistent in the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand regime confirmed at a lower level; the average demand from P3 to P11 is 77.8 units, which is 40% lower than the initial historical average of 130.8.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' continues to exhibit a downward demand trend. Since Period 3, demand has dropped significantly from the historical average of 130.8. The average demand across the last 10 periods (P3-P12) is approximately 76.6 units per week, which is 41% lower than the initial historical mean. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later; P5-P6 arrive 4 periods later; P7/P8 orders were 0). We are currently in Period 13 (early May). Demand in P11 was 47 and P12 was 84, showing some volatility at this lower level. To align the OR backend with this lower regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 to lock in the lower mean. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to capture the current volatility. Lead time is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: The average demand from P3 to P12 is approximately 76.6 units, reflecting a ~41% reduction from initial historical levels (130.8).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Analysis of the demand history from Period 3 (late February) through Period 13 shows a sustained shift. The average demand for the last 11 periods is 77.3 units, compared to the initial historical mean of 130.8. This ~41% decrease is confirmed and stable. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in Period 13's arrival from Period 9). On-hand inventory is 169 units with 218 in-transit. For Period 14, I will continue using the recent regime (P3-P13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=11 captures this lower demand level accurately while ignoring the higher initial spikes and historical data that no longer reflect current market behavior for these skinny jeans.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease remains stable: The average demand from P3 to P13 is 77.3 units, maintaining a ~41% reduction from initial historical levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' (SKU 554450027) has stabilized at a lower regime compared to the initial historical average of 130.8. Since Period 3, the mean demand has hovered around 77 units. However, Period 14 (May 13) showed a significant spike to 122 units, which may indicate the start of a seasonal summer lift or a temporary fluctuation. In-transit inventory (249) includes orders from Period 11, 12, 13, and 14. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P9 arrived P13, P10 arrived P14). I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (P3-P14) to capture the lower regime while acknowledging the recent uptick (average for P3-P14 is approx 81 units). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a lower regime compared to historicals, though Period 14 showed a potential upward deviation (122 units compared to the regime average of ~77). Average demand P3-P14 is 81.1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2414.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a second consecutive week of higher demand (128 units), following 122 units in Period 14. This suggests a potential return to the historical mean (approx. 131) after a prolonged period of softer demand (avg ~77). The product is 'Skinny Denim TRS', which typically maintains stable demand but may see seasonal upticks in late spring/early summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (18 units), but pipeline inventory is high (322 units). I will set mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture the recent upward trend while balancing it against the previous soft regime, effectively setting a mu_hat based on an average demand of approx 93 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially returning to historical levels: Period 14-15 average is 125 units, significantly higher than the P3-P13 average of 77.3 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554450027 has recently rebounded from a low-demand regime (avg ~77) back toward historical levels (~130). Periods 14, 15, and 16 show demand of 122, 128, and 91 respectively (avg 113.6). Last period we experienced a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 55 of 91 demanded), making it critical to build safety stock. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. Since we are observing a significant shift back to higher demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward trend while balancing it against the most recent softer data point. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to prevent further stockouts as demand stabilizes near 110-120 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from low-level regime: Periods 14-16 average demand is 113.7, up from the P3-P13 average of 77.3 units (+47%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' is a Denim Trousers item which saw a significant demand drop from Period 3 to Period 13 (averaging ~77 units), but has recently displayed a rebound. Specifically, over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has averaged 105.5 units (122, 128, 91, 81), which is higher than the previous low-regime average but still below the initial historical samples (~130). We are currently in early June (2019-06-10), heading into summer, where denim demand often remains stable or slightly increases. While P16 and P17 were slightly lower than P14-P15, the overall level is clearly above the mid-cycle low. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P9, P10, P11, P12, and P13). There are currently 498 units in transit (orders from P14-P17), and only 1 unit on hand. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this recovered demand level (~105.5 units/period * 5 periods = 527.5), and using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from P3-P13 low-level regime (avg 77) to a higher level (P14-P17 avg 105.5).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' is a pair of superstretch skinny denim trousers. The demand history shows three distinct phases: initial high demand (avg ~145), a prolonged low period (P3-P13 avg ~77), and a recent volatile rebound (P14-P18 avg ~94). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P15-P18) have seen demand of 128, 91, 81, and 49 respectively. The drop to 49 in P18 suggests the rebound may be cooling off as we enter mid-June. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently heavy (525 units in-transit) compared to the recent demand mean. I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current average demand (mean of P14-P18 is ~94) including the recent spike and the immediate drop-off, which keeps the forecast responsive to the most recent evidence of slowing demand while maintaining safety stock for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen in this recent cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in the P14-P18 period (range 49-128) following the low-regime phase, with a notable drop to 49 in P18 suggesting a potential cooling from the May rebound.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/6/24), demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last two weeks (P18: 49, P19: 31), compared to the rebound seen in May. This suggests the post-rebound demand has cooled as we enter late June. Specifically, the average demand of the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is 87 units, but the last 2 weeks suggest a lower level. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (validated by the P15 order arriving in P19). Given the high On-hand (124) and substantial In-transit (435) totaling 559 units, there is likely enough inventory to cover the next (L+1=5) periods even at the higher May levels. However, because demand is falling, I will use a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the recent volatility and cooling trend, allowing the backend to adjust the base stock downward safely to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this denim product.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: Following a mid-May rebound (P14-P15), demand has dropped significantly in P18-P19 (avg 40 units), suggesting a return to the lower demand regime seen earlier in the spring.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Analysis of the demand history reveals a significant drop over the last three periods (P18-P20: 49, 31, 15), confirming the 'cooling' trend noted in the carry-over insights. These three periods average approximately 31.7 units, which is a sharp decline from the May rebound levels. This decline likely reflects a seasonal drop for denim skinny jeans as summer temperatures rise in the Northern Hemisphere. Lead times remain consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 order arriving in P20). Given the high on-hand inventory (257) and in-transit units (289) relative to the crashing demand, the priority is to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this immediate downward regime shift and set sigma_hat to default to account for the overall volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P18-P20 average demand is 31.7 units, a sharp drop from the P14-P17 rebound average of 105.5 units, likely suggesting seasonal decline for denim trousers in summer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, mid-summer. Demand for the 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' (superstretch washed denim trousers) has entered a sharp decline, likely due to seasonal factors as temperatures rise. The last four periods (P18-P21) show a demand sequence of 49, 31, 15, and 16 units, with the most recent three periods averaging only 20.7 units. This is a significant drop from the spring rebound average of ~105 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 388 units on-hand and 142 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 530), and demand currently at ~20 units/week, we have over 25 weeks of supply on hand. No further ordering is required. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime (using recent_N=4 to capture the summer cooling) and maintain L at the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling for summer confirmed: Demand dropped significantly from P18-P21 (averaging 27.75) compared to P14-P17 (averaging 105.5), likely reflecting seasonal irrelevance for heavy denim in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' continues to remain in a summer cooling phase, consistent with seasonal trends for heavy denim/trousers. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is 29 units, compared to the spring rebound average of 105.5 units. On-hand inventory is very high at 464 units, which is enough to cover over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (29 units/week). With a lead time of 4 periods and a pipeline of 32 units, we are significantly overstocked. To minimize holding costs while the backend policy (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) likely results in zero orders due to high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect this sustained lower demand regime (avg ~29). Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed (P18-P22): Average demand has stabilized at ~29 units/week, down from the May rebound average of 105.5 units (-72%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' (Skinny Denim TRS) is in a confirmed summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is 29.16 units/week, a significant drop from the spring peak. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 464 units, which covers over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock and low summer demand for denim, I am setting parameters to cease ordering (by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low regime while inventory is liquidated) to minimize holding costs. The OR backend will see the high pipeline/on-hand inventory relative to these parameters and naturally place an order of 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has firmly settled into a summer low-demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 23.0 units (15, 16, 34, 30, 20), which is roughly an 82% decrease from the initial historical mean of 130.8. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 446 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given that the mean demand for the lead-time window (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 115 units at current rates, the existing stock covers almost 20 periods of supply. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this low-demand state and rely on the high on-hand inventory to satisfy demand without further ordering. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor remains stable: P20-P24 average demand is 23.0 units, confirming the significant seasonal drop for denim trousers in July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has stabilized at a low summer floor. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has averaged 20.3 units per week, significantly lower than the springtime average. On-hand inventory is currently very high (419 units) relative to this demand level, which is more than enough to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 weeks) even if demand were to triple. The pipeline is currently empty as no orders were placed in recent periods. No new orders are needed; the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders given the high on-hand stock and low demand. I will set the demand parameters using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the current summer regime, and keep lead time at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of denim trousers, a product type whose demand typically cycles based on seasonality. Since mid-June (Period 19), there has been a significant and sustained drop in demand, coinciding with the peak summer months. Over the last 8 periods (P19-P26), the average demand is 28.8 units per week, which is a massive 78% reduction compared to the initial historical average (130.8). Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 58 units, which may signal the early stages of a late-summer/back-to-school recovery as we move into mid-August. However, current on-hand inventory is 361 units, which at the recent average demand levels, covers over 10 weeks of supply. Given the 1$ holding cost and the high stock levels relative to the current low-demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set the L parameter to calculate to reflect the stable 4-period lead time and use recent_N (N=8) for demand parameters to capture this summer floor while allowing for the slight volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor (mid-June to August) confirmed: Primary demand for denim trousers dropped to ~29 units/week from P19-P26, a ~78% decrease from historical mean.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are exiting the summer demand floor (June-July), where demand for these skinny denim trousers averaged ~29 units/week. Recent data shows a clear upward trend as we approach the back-to-school and autumn season: demand rose from 20 in P24 to 27 in P25, 58 in P26, and 74 in P27. This confirms the start of a seasonal recovery. On-hand inventory is 287 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand (74) and the lead time (4 periods), the total demand across the (L+1) horizon is expected to increase as we move into September. To capture this momentum without over-ordering while on-hand inventory is still sufficient to cover nearly 4 weeks of current demand, I will focus on the most recent 4 periods (P24-P27) to calculate mu_hat, reflecting the transition out of the summer lull. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 4 periods to capture the increasing volatility during this regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery initiated: Demand increased from a summer floor of ~20-30 units to 58 (P26) and 74 (P27), indicating the start of the autumn/back-to-school seasonal upswing for denim trousers.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 554450027 (skinny denim trousers) shows a clear seasonal pattern: a summer floor throughout June and July followed by a recovery starting in August (likely back-to-school demand). Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) was 58, 74, and 65, averaging 65.7 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer floor of ~23-29 units. Since denim is a staple for autumn, I expect demand to continue climbing toward the historical mean of ~120-130 units observed in February/March. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (222) plus in-transit (31) equals 253 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). If demand averages 85-100 units during this recovery phase, we need approximately 425-500 units in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (reflecting a forecast of 90 units/week over 5 periods) to trigger restocking as we move into the peak autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand increased from summer lows to an average of 65.7 units/week (P26-P28), signaling the start of the back-to-school/seasonal upward trend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is in a seasonal recovery phase as we enter September (Back-to-School season). After a summer floor where demand averaged ~29 units (P19-P26), demand has increased in the recent 'Autumn recovery' period. Although Period 29 showed a dip to 36 units, the preceding weeks (P26-P28) averaged 65.7 units, indicating a volatile but upward trend compared to summer. I will use a 4-period window (P26-P29) for mu_hat to capture this recovery while smoothing the P29 dip. The average demand for this window is (58+74+65+36)/4 = 58.25 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory (On-hand 186 + In-transit 161 = 347) currently covers about 5.9 periods of this recovered demand, which is close to the (L+1)=5 target, so the OR backend will likely place a moderate replenishment order to maintain the pipeline as older units are sold off.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). Demand for denim trousers is recovering from the summer floor (approx 29 units/week) as we enter the autumn/back-to-school season. Recent demand (P26-P30) has been 58, 74, 65, 36, and 95, averaging 65.6 units/week. This represents a significant and sustained increase from the summer lows, but remains below the initial historical mean of ~131. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovery phase specifically. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all arrivals, so I will maintain the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: P26-P30 average demand is 65.6 units/week, a significant increase from the summer floor of ~29 units, reflecting seasonal back-to-school trends for denim.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn 'back-to-school' season (mid-September), which historically sees a rebound in denim demand. Recent observed demand (P26-P31: 58, 74, 65, 36, 95, 112) confirms this recovery with an average of ~73.3 units/week, significantly higher than the summer floor of ~29 units. The most recent demand (P30-P31) shows a spike into the triple digits (112), and the system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using method 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full autumn recovery phase (starting P26) and setting sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility during this transition period. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that replenishes inventory to handle the seasonal demand upswing while managing stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery accelerating: Periods 30-31 average 103.5 units/week, surpassing the earlier recovery average of 65.6 units and returning to near-original historical levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS is clearly in a seasonal recovery phase as we enter late September (back-to-school/autumn). Recent demand (P30-P32) has averaged 102 units/week, a significant increase from the summer floor and returning to historical levels. Despite the arrival of the P28 order (31 units), we are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) due to this demand surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (354 units) consists of orders from P29 (130), P30 (4), P31 (102), and P32 (118). To capture the current upward trend and ensure we meet demand through the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) which reflect this autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set based on these recent samples to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Periods 30-32 average demand is 102.0 units/week, returning to near historical levels (130) and showing significant recovery from the summer floor of ~29 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has significantly rebounded from the summer floor (~29 units) to a high-level regime as we move into the autumn/back-to-school season. Demand in Period 33 reached 160 units, exceeding the previous weeks' average of ~102 units and the historical mean of ~131. This indicates an accelerating upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 341 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the sharp spike to 160 in Period 33, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture this peak demand and prevent further stockouts. I'll set the forecast at 135 units/week (total mu_hat = (1+4)*135 = 675) which balances the historical mean with the recent acceleration. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 160 units, signaling that the recovery from summer lows has surpassed historical averages (131) and enters a seasonal peak phase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is experiencing a strong seasonal autumn peak, with demand in Period 33 hitting 160 units and Period 34 at 131 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 119.4 units, which aligns with the historical average of ~131 but is significantly higher than the summer floor (~29). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) due to this rapid recovery. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand expected as we move further into October (peak denim season), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher peak regime. sigma_hat is also set to N=5 to account for the high volatility observed during this recovery phase (range 95-160).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand for P30-P34 averages 119.4 units, returning to historical levels of ~131 and confirming the end of the summer low regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in its peak autumn demand phase, following a significant recovery from the summer floor. The demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has averaged 125.2 units/week, closely matching the original historical average of ~131. There have been stockouts in the last 5 consecutive periods (P31-P35) due to the sharp upward shift in demand, resulting in zero on-hand inventory at the start of Period 36. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P31 order arrived in P35). To address the current stockout and capture the sustained peak, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~125, std ~22). This will provide a base stock level that targets covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand while balancing against the risk of overstocking as we approach the end of the 47-period horizon.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has fully recovered from the summer low (approx. 29 units) and is now trending around the historical mean of 131 units or slightly higher, with an average of 125.4 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). We are currently experiencing stockouts due to high demand and the 4-period lead time delay. On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a large pipeline of 593 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P31 arrived in P35, P32 arrived in P36). To maintain service levels during this autumn peak, I am using a recent 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since the recovery. This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects current peak demand while accounting for the high volatility observed during the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilized: Average demand from P32 to P36 is 126.4 units, confirming a return to and stabilization at historical levels (~131).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is in its autumn peak season (late October). Recent demand (P32-P37) has stabilized at a mean of 127.2 units/week, closely aligned with the initial historical mean of 131. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 597 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) to reach the base stock level. Using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat (P32-P37) captures the current peak regime without dilution from the previous summer trough or the earlier part of the recovery. Sigma_hat also uses N=6 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the inventory pipeline stays filled as we remain in the peak autumn sales period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) has successfully returned to its historical demand level following a summer slump. The current date is November 4th, which typically sees sustained demand for denim products heading into the colder months and the start of holiday shopping. Recent demand from Period 32 to Period 38 has been stable, averaging 126.6 units per week (99, 160, 131, 124, 118, 131, 123). Period 38 marked a transition where on-hand inventory finally became positive (85 units) after several periods of stockouts, thanks to the arrival of the large Period 34 order (208 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. Using a recent window of N=7 for demand capture ensures we reflect the stabilized post-recovery mean while accounting for the high volatility seen in the autumn peak (e.g., the 160 units in P33). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to utilize the highly stable 4-period historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Period 32-38 average demand is 126.6 units, effectively mirroring the original historical mean (~131) and confirming full recovery from the summer seasonal floor.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P40 (2019/11/11). Since Period 32, demand has stabilized around the historical mean of ~131 units/week, after recovered from the summer floor. The last 8 periods (P32-P39) show an average demand of 119.6 units, but with recent weeks (P34-P38) averaging 125.4. Period 39 saw a dip to 71, which may be a weekly fluctuation or the start of a late-year taper before any potential holiday spike. Given the product is 'super-skinny denim trousers' in a 'Divided' (youth) collection, demand usually stays robust through November. For OR parameters, I'll use the promised lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistently actualized. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the stabilized autumn recovery level (approx 120 units/week), as using the full history would still be influenced by the extreme summer lows. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to account for the current regime's volatility. On-hand is 165, and there is a healthy pipeline of 465 units arriving over the next 4 periods, which will adequately cover demand given the lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) has stabilized back to historical demand levels following an autumn recovery. The mean demand from Period 32 to Period 40 is approximately 117.4 units/week, closely aligning with the original historical mean (~131) and the Carry-over Insight from Period 39. Inventory levels are healthy with on-hand units at 182 and a robust pipeline (412 units), including arrivals scheduled from orders in Period 37-40. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47) and currently have several weeks of inventory coverage (on-hand + pipeline total 594 units), I am maintaining the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters using recent_N=9 (capturing the stabilized peak from P32-P40) to prevent over-ordering as the game concludes, while ensuring enough stock is maintained for the final stretch. L is set to default as the lead time has been highly reliable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical patterns and recent data for this denim SKU show that after a summer floor (June-August), demand recovered in September/October to original historical levels (~131 units/week). However, for the most recent period (P38-P41), demand has softened slightly to an average of about 89 units/week (123, 71, 100, 86). With the game ending at P47 and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P42) will arrive in P46, leaving only one final period of sales (P47) to benefit from this arrival. We currently have 217 units on-hand and 377 in-transit. The in-transit units from P38, P39, P40, and P41 (113, 114, 64, 86 respectively) are expected to arrive in P42, P43, P44, and P45. This pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods given the recent 89 units/week average. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this slight softening and avoid over-ordering as we approach the game's end, ensuring we don't carry excess inventory into the final period.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed post-autumn peak: Periods 38-41 average 90 units/week, down from the October stabilization of ~126 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This is a critical retail period covering the aftermath of Black Friday and the lead-up to the December holiday season. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike to 232 units, which is significantly higher than the 'softened' average of 90 units observed in P38-P41. This spike is highly consistent with late November/early December holiday shopping for apparel. I am shifting the demand forecast to account for this seasonal surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (P38-P42) which averages 122.4 units per period, much closer to the current reality than the longer-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the holiday season. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent historical performance (P38 order arrived in P42). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 264 units, which combined with 98 units on-hand, provides a reasonable base for the next few weeks, but the high demand requires an updated base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Early December demand surge confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 232 units, shifting the recent 5-period average (P38-P42) to 122.4 units, likely due to holiday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-volatility holiday demand phase. Period 42 saw a major spike (232 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a correction in Period 43 (72 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (target 47), the current on-hand (140) and pipeline (378) total 518 units. Expected arrivals over the next 4 periods (based on orders from P40-P43) are 64, 86, 0, and 228. To capture the remaining December demand\u2014which typically remains elevated until Christmas\u2014I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average including the holiday spike. The recent 5-period average (P39-P43) is 112.2 units. Given the massive order of 228 units placed in P43, the backend will naturally limit further orders unless demand parameters are set to justify a higher base stock. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent holiday volatility while allowing for a potential pre-Christmas surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 spike (232 units) followed by Period 43 correction (72 units). 5-period average (P39-P43) is 112.2 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing high volatility due to holiday seasonality. Recently, we saw a massive spike in Period 42 (232 units) followed by relatively moderate demand (72, 79). The 5-period average (P40-P44) is 108.8 units, but the holiday peak (Black Friday/Early Dec) is likely wrapping up, transitioning into the Christmas/New Year sales period. Forecast (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=5 (P40-P44) to capture this holiday volume without overreacting solely to the P42 spike. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility (232 vs 72). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history. On-hand inventory is 125, with 539 in-transit; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap between this pipeline and the target base stock, ensuring protection against holiday stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (Dec) confirmed: High volatility observed with peak of 232 (P42) and average demand ~109 units (P40-P44).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the week of Christmas. Historical demand in December (P42-P45) has been highly volatile due to holiday shopping, with significant peaks (232 units in P42, 228 units in P45). The current on-hand inventory is 0, but we have 604 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 42 (0 units) to arrive during P46 (visible in P47 conclude), the order from Period 43 (228 units) to arrive during P47, and the order from Period 44 (225 units) to arrive during P48. Given the product's likely post-holiday seasonal drop (similar to the spring/summer pattern seen previously) and the high volume of orders already in the pipeline (604 units total), I will use an EWMA for demand estimation to capture the recent holiday spikes while allowing for a gradual smoothing as we move into January. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (Dec) confirmed: High volatility with significant spikes (232 in P42, 228 in P45), 4-period average is approx 153 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Period 47). Demand history shows a volatile holiday regime throughout December with significant spikes (232 in P42, 228 in P45). The holiday season is concluding, but demand remains elevated compared to the autumn stable period. Period 46 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 units sold due to a delayed shipment from Period 42 (ordered P42, not arrived by P46 conclude). However, lead time has been consistently 4 periods historically. The order from P42 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P46 or P47. Our current in-transit pipeline is substantial (915 units). To handle the volatility seen in the last 5 periods (mean ~131, but with spikes up to 232), I will use the recent 5 samples (P42-P46) for demand forecasting (mean = 131) to maintain a buffer for the end-of-year activity, while using the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: December holiday volatility confirmed: Demand spikes of 232 (P42) and 228 (P45) observed, with a 5-period average (P42-P46) of 131 units.
