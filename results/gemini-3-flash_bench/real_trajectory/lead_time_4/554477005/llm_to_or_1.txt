Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 554477005 is an 'ankle-length trousers in an airy viscose weave', which is a typical spring/summer transitional item. The historical demand data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows relatively stable demand with a mean of 22 units and a standard deviation of approximately 4.8. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we need an order that covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. There are currently 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (the total number of available historical samples) to establish a baseline. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock target of roughly (1+4) * 22 = 110 units plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', an airy viscose trouser from the Divided collection, which is likely a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averages 22 units/week. In Period 1, demand was 19, but we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. There are 30 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory, so we will continue to lose sales until arrivals begin. The backend OR logic will calculate the order based on (1+L) periods. Setting N=5 for demand statistics effectively captures the initial historical data provided (averaging approx 21.4). Given the spring nature of the product, demand might increase as we head into March, but for now, we will stick to recent averages.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Starting inventory was 0, and shipments from Period 1 and 2 (30 units each) are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 19 and 41 respectively. Historical data shows early 2019 demand between 15-27. The recent jump to 41 suggests a possible shift or seasonality for this SKU (an airy viscose trouser, likely trending for spring). Since we have 0 on-hand and are losing sales (all demand was lost in P1 and P2), we need to ensure our order logic accounts for the increased demand. I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for the mean to capture the recent trajectory, including the historical 15, 27, 22, 26, 20 and the new 19, 41. N=5 will focus on the most recent demand spikes. Lead time is kept at default (4) as no orders have arrived yet to prove otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', an airy viscose trouser from the Divided collection, which is seasonally appropriate for the transition into spring/summer. Historical demand from Jan/Feb averaged 21.4 units/week, but the last two observed periods (P2 and P3) spiked significantly to 41 units each, suggesting a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, no arrivals are expected until Period 5 (P1 order + 4 lead time). Consequently, we have been stocking out with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 102 units (30+30+42). To address the recent demand surge, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the jump from ~20 to ~40 units. Since no orders have arrived yet, I will stick with the 'default' lead time of 4 until we observe the actual arrival of the Period 1 order in next period's summary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-18: Weekly demand increased from ~20 to ~41 units (+100%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU 554477005 (viscose trousers) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and 157 units currently in-transit. No orders have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the first order placed in Period 1 (30 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: initial samples (20, 26, 22, 27, 15) averaged ~22, while recent periods (Period 1, 2, 3, 4) show demand of 19, 41, 41, and 27. The spike in Feb (41 units) suggests a seasonal lift for spring fashion. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this higher mean (avg ~32). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the increased volatility (std dev approx 10.6). For lead time (L), I will stick to 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any completed delivery cycles to justify a change.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', a spring/summer item (airy viscose, ankle-length). We have confirmed a demand regime shift starting mid-February, with recent demand averaging ~35 units per week (41, 41, 27, 32). Lead time is currently confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 order arrived at the end of P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded the first arrival (30 units). There are 151 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (30 units) expected to arrive during this period (P6). Since demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial samples, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new spring regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is an airy viscose trouser, likely entering peak spring/summer demand. History shows a clear demand regime shift around mid-February where demand jumped from ~20 to a mean of ~35 over the last 6 periods (41, 41, 27, 32, 36). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently outpaced the small initial shipments. Total in-transit is 160 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). We need to maintain a base stock that covers L+1=5 periods. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing the spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to default as the promised 4 periods is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P2 (2019-02-18) confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~20 to ~35 (+75%) across the last 6 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 554477005 (airy viscose trousers) is entering a spring demand phase. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: pre-Feb 18 average was ~21.7 units, whereas the last 7 periods (since P1) average ~35.7 units. The last period (P7) saw a spike to 53 units, suggesting increasing momentum for spring. Lead time inference: Orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived with exactly 4 periods of lead time (P5, P6, and P7 respectively), confirming L=4 is stable. Current on-hand is 0 due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 138 units (from orders in P4-P7). My target inventory must cover L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean of ~36, which suggests a base stock requirement around 180 units. Explicit sigma is set to 15 to account for the high variance (27 to 53) observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as exactly 4 periods over last 3 arrivals (P1, P2, P3 orders). Demand variance increasing as spring progresses (range 27-53).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand for this item (airy viscose trousers) is accelerating significantly as we enter spring, with Period 8 demand spiking to 85 units\u2014a clear upward regime shift compared to the previous average of ~38. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently outpaced supply, and we have 144 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P5, P6, P7, and P8). To address the recent demand surge and the stockout risk, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-growth phase (P5-P8 mean ~51.5) while being sensitive to the latest outlier (85). Setting L to 4 using recent_N=3 based on confirmed arrivals ensures the backend properly accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 8 demand (85) reflects a significant jump from the previous 4-week average of 38 (+123%), likely due to seasonal demand for spring apparel.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth seasonal phase for 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', an airy viscose trouser suitable for spring. The demand has shifted from an initial average of ~20 to ~35, and recently spiked to ~81 over the last two weeks (85 and 77). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, which means we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded arrivals (stocking out every period since Period 5). The pipeline inventory is 212 units (representing orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). To stabilize, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the average demand of the spring surge (~58 units/period x 5 = 290) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility (std \u2248 25). These parameters signal to the OR backend that we need a higher base stock to stop the 'sold < demand' cycle, while the 212 units in-transit will prevent the OR engine from over-ordering beyond the cap.

Carry-over insight: High-demand spring regime confirmed: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 56.6 units, compared to the previous average of ~30. Structural stockouts have occurred for 5 consecutive periods due to demand outstripping the old ordering logic.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' (airy viscose ankle-length trousers), which is a quintessential spring/summer garment. We are currently in late April (2019/4/22), entering the peak demand season. Demand has exploded from an initial ~20 units to 129 units in the most recent period (P10). For the last 6 periods, we have consistently sold out all inventory upon arrival, indicating that historical demand mean is far too low and needs urgent adjustment to capture this seasonal peak. I am observing a 4-period lead time consistently. Given the rapid acceleration (77 in P9 to 129 in P10), I will use an explicit mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~130 units per week across the lead time (L=4) plus current period (1+L=5), totaling 650. I will set a high sigma_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for further acceleration and to ensure the backend base stock covers the current stockout deficit.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Demand for airy spring trousers accelerated sharply in April, reaching 129 units/week from an average of ~56 in the prior 5 weeks (+130% increase). Continuous stockouts since Period 5.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth seasonal peak for 'airy viscose weave trousers' as we enter late April (2019/4/29). Demand has exploded from ~20 to 184 units/week over the last 11 periods. We have experienced 7 consecutive periods of structural stockouts (beginning Period 5) where demand significantly exceeded arrivals. Current on-hand is 0, but a large pipeline (490 units) is in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand for Period 11 was 184, up from 129 in Period 10 (+42%). Given the product type and time of year, we are likely approaching the seasonal peak. To capture this growth while accounting for the confirmed lead time (L=4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent accelerated demand (weighted average of 184, 129, and 77). This ensures 'base_stock' reflects the current (L+1) demand window (~5 periods) needed to satisfy customers until the next possible arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained for 11 periods: Period 11 demand reached 184 units, a 42% increase from P10 (129) and a 139% increase from P9 (77). Consecutive stockouts for 7 periods (P5-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of airy viscose spring trousers, currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (May). Over the last four periods, demand has surged significantly (P9: 77, P10: 129, P11: 184, P12: 111). Despite a slight dip in P12 (111), the trend remains structurally much higher than the initial history. We have suffered from consecutive stockouts since Period 5 because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) were insufficient to meet this accelerated growth. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods of demand (N=4) to capture this higher mean (approx 125 units/week * 5 weeks = 625), ensuring our base stock targets exceed the current pipeline of 648 units to finally break the cycle of stockouts and meet the high spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during peak spring season; Period 12 demand (111) suggests a potential plateau or slight cooling after the P11 peak (184), but mean demand remains >5x the baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May). The product is 'airy trousers', which are highly seasonal. We have observed a significant peak in April (P11 demand 184) followed by a cooling trend in early May (P12: 111, P13: 79). Despite the cooling, we are still seeing significantly higher demand than the initial baseline (avg ~20). We finally broke a 7-period stockout streak in P13, ending with 13 units on hand. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrivals from P5 to P9. Mu_hat must account for (L+1) periods, which is 5 weeks. Although demand is slowing, we still have a substantial pipeline (619 units) including large orders placed in P11 (241) and P12 (219) that will arrive in P15 and P16. To prevent excessive overstocking as the spring peak subsides, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current cooling trend (avg ~125). I will use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the high volatility seen during the peak and subsequent decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed post-April peak: Demand dropped from 184 (P11) to 111 (P12) and 79 (P13), though remains ~4x baseline. Stockout streak ended in P13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), we are in the post-peak spring season for these airy viscose trousers. Demand peaked at 184 units (Period 11) and has since stabilized/cooled to a range of 79-111 over the last three periods (mean of ~91). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently very high (603 units) due to aggressive ordering during the April stockout crisis. The incoming shipment from Period 11 (241 units) arrives this period, which combined with existing on-hand stock and subsequent large arrivals, ensures we will satisfy demand for the foreseeable future. To avoid excessive holding costs as the seasonal peak passes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=3) to reflect the recent cooling trend (averaging ~91 per week) rather than the extreme April peak. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that reconciles with the large pipeline inventory and prevents unnecessary over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau observed post-April peak: mean demand for P12-P14 stabilized at ~91 units/week, down from the peak of 184 (-50%) but significantly higher than the pre-spring baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019-05-27), the item (airy spring trousers) is past its suspected seasonal peak (April). Demand has stabilized since the peak of 184 (P11), with recent observations of 111, 79, 83, and 122. The 4-week average is approximately 98.75 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 145 and in-transit is 362 (Total coverage = 507 units). With an lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 4-week mean (~100), the target pipeline should be roughly 500 units. The current 507 units (145 on hand + 362 in transit) is sufficient to cover demand for the next 5 periods without aggressive additional ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the post-peak stabilization and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. L remains at calculate (matching the verified 4-period lead time).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (May): Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~99 units/week (last 4 periods), significantly higher than the initial baseline but approximately 50% of the April peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. We are specializing in airy spring trousers (SKU 554477005). Historical demand showed a massive April peak (reaching 184) and has since entered a high-volume, high-volatility May regime. The last four periods of demand are 79, 83, 122, and 172. While demand spiked to 172 in Period 16, the overall post-peak average from P13-P16 is approximately 114 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 192 units following recent large arrivals from the April ordering surge. Pipeline inventory is 170 units (orders from P13: 63, P14: 80, P16: 27). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 362 units. With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (P12-P16) provides a mean of ~114 units, requiring a base stock around 570. The current position (362) is below this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture this high-volatility late-spring regime while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering during the pivot towards summer. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak volatility shift: Period 16 demand (172) shows significant late-spring volatility; mean demand for P13-P16 is 114 units/week.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' shows a significant resurgence as summer approaches (June 10). Demand for Period 16 was 172 units and Period 17 was 185 units, indicating that the late-spring volatility has transitioned into a high-demand summer regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 128 units/week, but the most recent two weeks have significantly exceeded this average. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 70 and 283 units in-transit (arriving in P18, P19, P20, P21), the pipeline is healthy but must be managed for the current peak. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the high-demand volatility of the last month) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects that the mean has shifted significantly upward from the post-peak cooling observed in P13-P14.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed: Demand for P16-P17 (avg 178) has surpassed the previous post-peak stabilization level (~99), reflecting a second seasonal peak or sustained summer demand for airy trousers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This product (airy viscose trousers) is in its peak summer season. Observations from the last three periods (P16-P18: 172, 185, 140) show a sustained high-demand regime with a mean of ~166 units/week, significantly higher than the May average of ~99. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from P1-P14. The in-transit inventory is high (421 units) due to aggressive ordering in P11-P12 and recent orders in P17-P18, but with demand averaging 166, the total pipeline (On-hand 10 + In-transit 421 = 431) only covers approximately 2.6 periods of demand (431 / 166), which is less than the L+1 window of 5 periods (830 units required). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect this summer peak across the last 3 periods to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to cover the current demand velocity.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P18): mean demand stabilized at ~166 units/week, up from ~99 in May (+67%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554477005' (airy viscose trousers) is in a high-demand summer regime. Period 19 demand spiked to 219, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). The moving average for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 179 units/week, up from the May average of ~99. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P14 order arrived in P18). In Period 19, the order from Period 15 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival, explaining the stockout despite high demand. I need to set parameters based on the current summer regime (N=4) to ensure the OR backend generates orders sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at ~179 units/week. mu_hat is set to 895 (5 * 179). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Average demand for Period 16-19 increased to 179 units/week (+80% compared to May levels). Period 19 experienced a total stockout due to a zero-order event in Period 15.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554477005' (airy viscose trousers) is in the middle of a high-demand summer peak. Period 20 demand reached 220 units, confirming the upward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the P15 order was 0, resulting in no arrivals in P19 and only a small arrival (27 units from P16) in P20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (831 units) consists of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20. To maintain a high service level during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P17-P20) to capture the current mean of 191 units per week. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the high-demand, high-volatility summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak intensified in late June: Period 19-20 demand averaged 219.5 units, a 23% increase over the early June average (178).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy viscose trouser, identifying it as a summer seasonal item. Demand peaked in late June (P19-P20) at ~220 units but showed a decrease in P21 to 147 units. Historical analysis shows two distinct summer demand regimes: early June (avg ~166) and peak June (avg ~195). Given the July 8 date, we are likely transitioning past the summer peak. I will use the last 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the full summer surge while tempering the recent peak with the moderate P21 data. This gives a mean demand of approximately 180 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting L=4, mu_hat=900 (calculated as (4+1)*180), and sigma_hat=85 (calculating standard deviation over the last 6 periods and scaling by sqrt(5)) to maintain an 80% service level during the potential plateau or taper of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P21) mean stabilized at ~180 units/week, reflecting a major seasonal peak for airy trousers. Period 21 (147 units) suggests a potential post-peak cooling from the late June highs (>200).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' (airy viscose trousers) is currently in its peak summer demand regime. Historical demand for the summer period (Period 16-22) has averaged approximately 176 units/week, though recent weeks (P21 and P22) show a slight cooling to average ~146 units. The product is seasonal; we expect high demand to persist through July before potentially tapering off in August. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P18 order arrived in P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 101 and in-transit is 725 (total 826 pipeline). To ensure availability for the next 5 periods (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $4 profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime average (~176 units) and volatility. Lead time 'L' calculation remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P22) mean is ~176 units/week. Recent data (P21-P22) suggests a potential peak-pass with demand stabilizing around 146 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554477005' (airy viscose trousers) is in a post-peak summer regime. Demand peaked in late June (P19-P20) at ~220 units and has since trended downwards: P21 (147), P22 (146), and P23 (109). The current mean for the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is 134 units, down from the peak summer average of ~180. Given we are in late July, demand for airy summer trousers is expected to continue cooling. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current pipeline inventory is high (637 units), and on-hand is healthy (196). To avoid high holding costs as the season winds down, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent cooling trend (avg ~134), which results in a mu_hat of 670 for the (L+1) horizon. This will allow the OR backend to right-size orders and avoid overstocking into autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~180 (June) to ~134 (July) across P21-P23 (-25%). Expected further seasonal decline for summer-specific apparel.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' (airy viscose trousers) is entering a clear post-peak cooling phase as the summer season progresses (late July). Historical demand peaked in June (averaging ~219 units) and has since trended downwards: P21 (147), P22 (146), P23 (109), and P24 (144). The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 136.5 units. Given that this is a summer-specific 'airy' product, I expect demand to continue its decline towards the August/September transition. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P20 order arriving in P24. Currently, there is 285 on-hand and 404 in-transit (orders from P21, P22, P23). To avoid excessive holding costs on a cooling seasonal item while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (N=4 captures the July downtrend) and explicit sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak cooling phase confirmed (July): Mean demand dropped to ~136 units/week (P21-P24), a ~25% decrease from the June peak (~180). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26 (August 5). The product is a pair of airy viscose trousers, which is highly seasonal. Historical data shows a clear peak in June (average ~180 units) followed by a cooling phase in July (P21-P25 average ~128 units). The most recent demand (P25) was 94 units, confirming the descent into late summer/autumn. On-hand inventory is high at 386 units, and in-transit is 238 units (ordered in P22, P23, and P25). The total coverage currently exceeds likely demand for the 5-period horizon (L+1). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand continues to decline seasonally, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5 samples (July data) to capture the current mean of ~128 and sigma_hat similarly to account for recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed: July average demand (P21-P25) dropped to ~128 units/week from the June peak of ~180 (-29%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. We are in a clear post-summer cooling phase for airy trousers (SKU 554477005). Demand has dropped from a June peak of ~220 units to a late July/early August average of ~75 units (P25 demand: 94, P26 demand: 56). On-hand inventory is currently high (423 units) due to arrivals from previous high-volume orders (P21 and P22). With demand trending downwards as we move toward late August, the current stock plus in-transit (208 units, total 631) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P23-P26) to capture this cooling trend (avg ~100 units/week) and use recent_N for sigma to account for the reduced volatility in this downward regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling deepening: August week 1 (P26) demand dropped to 56 units, the lowest since early April. Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 98 units, compared to June's ~180 peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'airy viscose weave trousers', a seasonal summer item. We are now in Period 28 (mid-August), and the historical demand shows a clear cooling phase since the summer peak in late June (P20). Demand has dropped from ~220 units to 56 and 63 units in the last two periods. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is approximately 71 units, reflecting the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is high (476 units), which at current demand levels covers over 6 weeks of sales. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, we must avoid overstocking as the season ends. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this rapid late-summer decline and prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on high historical summer averages.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand decline confirmed (August): Mean demand for P25-P27 dropped to ~71 units/week, a 67% decrease from the June peak (~219 units). High inventory levels are now a risk as the season for airy trousers concludes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 29), and the demand for 'airy viscose trousers' is in a clear seasonal decline as summer ends. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~220 units in June to 45 units in Period 28. On-hand inventory is currently very high (431 units), which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the remainder of the season (estimated (L+1) demand is around 250-300 units assuming a continued glide path). The pipeline includes 92 units (from orders in P25 and P26). Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:4 ratio) and the high stock level, we must avoid further ordering to minimize holding costs and potential obsolescence at the end of the season. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the sharp downward trend in demand, which will result in a base stock level lower than our current inventory + pipeline, effectively triggering a zero-order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed: Period 28 demand (45) is the lowest since early March. The product (airy trousers) is exiting its peak seasonal utility. Inventory management priority must shift from service level to minimizing holding costs and liquidation risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-270.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is an airy spring/summer trouser which has clearly entered a late-season demand decline as of September. Demand has fallen from its June peak of ~220 units to just 38 units in Period 29. With 422 units on hand and a lead time of 4 periods, we already have over 11 weeks of supply at current demand rates. The inventory level is extremely high relative to the collapsing demand, creating a significant holding cost risk as the product exits its seasonal window. My objective is to prevent further accumulation and let the existing inventory bleed down. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P27-P29) and relying on the 'recent_N' logic to align the base stock with the new low-demand environment. Since on-hand (422) + in-transit (63) is far greater than any reasonable base stock for this demand level, the OR backend will correctly continue to order zero units.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse finalized: Period 27-29 demand averaged 48.6 units/week, down ~78% from the summer peak. Product transitioning to off-season; focus shifts to inventory depletion.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has clearly entered its off-season phase as of September. Demand has collapsed from a June peak of ~219 units/week to a recent 3-period average of 39 units (P28-P30). With 451 units on hand and zero in-transit, the current inventory already covers approximately 11.5 weeks of current demand, which is far beyond the 5-week coverage target (L+1). At a holding cost of $1.0/unit/period, the priority is to stop all ordering and allow the on-hand stock to deplete to avoid excessive holding costs during the low-demand winter months. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this low-demand regime, which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively zeroing out new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: End-of-summer collapse definitive. Mean demand for P28-P30 is 39 units/week (-82% from June peak). Inventory strategy shifted to 'drain mode' to minimize holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) is now well into its off-season (mid-September). Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the average demand for the last 4 periods (P28-P31) being 37.25 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 419 units, with no units in transit. Given the current demand rate, the existing stock covers approximately 11 weeks of sales (419 / 37 \u2248 11.3). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have nearly 3 times the necessary stock to cover the lead time + review period, any further ordering will only increase holding costs without improving service levels. Consequently, I am keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat low to reflect the off-season regime and ensuring no new orders are placed by the OR backend. The goal remains to drain the current surplus inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for airy trousers stabilized at ~37 units/week (P28-P31), an 83% reduction from June peak. Current inventory levels (419 units) represent significant overstock for the autumn season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has entered its off-season as of late September (Period 33). Demand has stabilized at a low regime, with the last five periods (P28-P32) averaging 34.8 units/week, a sharp decline from the summer peak of ~180 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 394 units with 0 units in transit. Given the current mean demand, the existing inventory covers approximately 11 weeks of sales. Since the holding cost is significant ($1.0/unit) and the product is likely to face further seasonal decline or complete obsolescence as autumn progresses, the primary objective is to liquidate existing stock. No new orders are needed. I have set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 35 units/week) and maintained the stable lead time of 4. The OR engine will naturally produce a zero order given the massive surplus relative to the base stock requirement.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand off-season regime confirmed for Period 33: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is 34.8 units/week. Inventory surplus (394 units) provides ~11 weeks of cover; liquidation strategy remains in effect.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has clearly entered its off-season phase as we enter October. Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the average of the last six periods (P28-P33) being approximately 34 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 363 units with zero units in-transit. At the current demand rate, this inventory provides approximately 10.6 weeks of cover, which extends well into December. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit/period vs. a profit of $4.0/unit, and the high likelihood that demand will remain low or even decrease further during the winter months, the primary objective remains inventory depletion to minimize holding costs. No new orders are needed as the current stock drastically exceeds the required safety stock for the current demand regime. I will continue to use the recent 6-period demand average to define mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR engine remains far below our current on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has entered its off-season regime. In the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged approximately 27.4 units per week, with a clear downward trend (hitting a low of 15 in P34). On-hand inventory is at 348 units, which covers approximately 12-13 weeks of current demand. There is no in-transit pipeline. The focus remains on liquidation to avoid holding costs ($1/unit/period) which currently exceed potential profit if stock is held too long. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7 periods (P28-P34, mean ~31) to reflect the low-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock level well below current on-hand inventory, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand regime (Oct) confirmed: Mean demand for P30-P34 has dropped further to ~27 units/week. Inventory exit strategy remains active.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has entered its off-season regime in October. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a low of 11 units in Period 35, with a 5-period average (P31-P35) of approximately 22.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 337 units, which provides over 14 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Since the remaining periods in the game (up to Period 47) are only 12 weeks, the current stock is more than sufficient to meet all remaining demand. The primary risk is excessive holding costs. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect the current low-demand environment using the last 5 periods (N=5) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock stays below the current on-hand + pipeline total, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed. This strategy facilitates the necessary inventory liquidation for an off-season product.

Carry-over insight: October off-season demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P35 dropped to ~23 units/week, a 35% decrease from the September average (~35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) is in a deep off-season demand regime as we move through late October. Demand has continued to decline, with the last five periods (P32-P36) averaging 20 units/week, and the most recent reading at 18 units. Current on-hand inventory is 319 units, which represents approximately 16 weeks of stock at current demand levels. There are no units in-transit. Given the high on-hand inventory and the seasonal decline, the primary objective remains inventory depletion to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while avoiding new orders. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current low-demand floor. L is set to 'calculate' based on stable historical arrival performance, although no new orders are intended.

Carry-over insight: October off-season demand floor established: Mean demand for P32-P36 is 20 units/week, confirming a continued decline from the September average of ~31.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) has entered its off-season (Late October). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging 17.8 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 305 units, which covers approximately 17 weeks of demand at the current rate. Since there are only 10 periods remaining in the simulation (up to Period 47) and the product is seasonally irrelevant for the upcoming winter months, the primary objective is to avoid any further orders and minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. I will set the base stock parameters (L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) to very low values to ensure the OR engine's 'base stock - pipeline' logic results in zero additional orders, effectively letting on-hand inventory bleed down.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) is in a deep off-season decline as we enter November. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last five periods (P34-P38) averaging approximately 14 units per week (15, 11, 18, 14, 12). On-hand inventory is currently 293 units, which provides over 20 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are no units in transit. Since the remaining game length is only 9 periods and current stock far exceeds any reasonable forecast for this off-season period, the priority remains 'drain mode' to minimize holding costs. No new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's target base stock remains well below my current on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: November off-season regime confirmed: Mean demand for P34-P38 has settled at ~14 units/week, reflecting a total decline from summer peaks and late-autumn stabilization.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its deep off-season (November), with demand reaching its lowest levels (7 units in P39). The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 12.4 units per week. With 286 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, the inventory coverage exceeds 20 weeks, which far exceeds the remaining 7 periods of the game. My objective remains inventory depletion to minimize holding costs, as the stock is more than sufficient to meet any foreseeable demand for this 'airy viscose' summer item during winter. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat at low levels using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the current floor, and keep L at default as no new orders are being placed.

Carry-over insight: November off-season floor confirmed: Mean demand for P35-P39 is 12.4 units/week, down from September's ~35. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (286 units), covering all remaining periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is an airy viscose trouser, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 41 (November 18), well into the off-season. Demand has consistently stayed at a low 'floor' since September. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 12.2 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 276 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 22 weeks of cover. Since the game ends at Period 47 (7 weeks remaining), we already have more than enough inventory to satisfy all remaining demand without any further orders. My objective is to minimize holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by the OR backend. I am using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilized late-autumn demand floor.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its deep off-season (late November). Demand has collapsed from summer peaks of >200 units/week to a very low stabilization floor. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 9.2 units per week (14, 12, 7, 10, 3), showing a continued downward crawl. On-hand inventory is 273 units, while the maximum expected demand for the remaining 6 periods of the simulation (until P47) is likely less than 60 units total. This represents a massive surplus. No orders have been placed since Period 26, and none are in transit. The primary goal remains inventory depletion to minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while providing a basic service level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime, which will result in an order of 0 due to the large inventory buffer.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor confirmed: Mean demand for P37-P41 is 9.2 units/week, down from September's ~35 and June's ~180 peak. Current inventory (273) provides ~29 weeks of cover at this rate, exceeding the remaining simulation length.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), approaching the end of the simulation (P47). The product is a seasonal summer item ('airy viscose weave', 'trousers') that is now deep in the off-season. Current demand has flattened significantly, with a mean of 9.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). On-hand inventory is 256 units, which at the current burn rate provides over 26 weeks of coverage. Since only 5 periods remain in the simulation, no further orders are required. The strategy remains focused on liquidation and minimizing holding costs, though the surplus is so large that we will inevitably end with excess inventory. I will use a very conservative N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand floor.

Carry-over insight: December off-season demand remains at a floor: mean demand for P38-P42 is 9.8 units/week. Inventory surplus (256 units) is sufficient to cover all remaining simulation periods without further procurement.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy viscose trousers) is in its deep off-season during December. Demand has collapsed from summer peaks (>200) to a floor of approximately 8 units per week over the last five periods (P39-P43: 7, 10, 3, 17, 2). With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P47) and 254 units on-hand, there is sufficient inventory to cover more than 30 weeks of demand at the current rate. To maximize total reward, the focus is strictly on minimizing holding costs by ensuring no further orders are placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 5-period window to accurately reflect this low-demand regime, which will keep the base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, resulting in an order of 0.

Carry-over insight: December off-season demand floor sustained: mean demand for P39-P43 is 7.8 units/week. Inventory (254) covers all remaining periods of the simulation.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is entering its final stages (Period 45 of 47). Current date is Dec 16, 2019. The product (airy viscose trousers) is in a deep off-season demand floor, with the recent 5-period average (P40-P44) at 7.4 units/week. On-hand inventory is 249 units, which provides over 30 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Since there are only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, and 47), the goal remains total inventory depletion. No further orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand floor, while the inventory surplus will satisfy all remaining demand without any new procurement.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47 (December 23rd). The product 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is an airy spring/summer trouser which has reached its absolute demand floor for the winter season. Current demand in December is extremely low (average of ~6 units over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 243 units, which is enough to cover more than 40 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given there is only one period remaining in the simulation, no additional units should be ordered. I will keep \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 low to ensure the base stock calculation remains significantly below the current on-hand inventory, and set L to default. This minimizes further holding costs for a product that is already in extreme surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-213.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), which is the final phase of the year. The product, described as 'airy viscose trousers', is a highly seasonal spring/summer item that is currently in its off-season floor regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has averaged approximately 5.2 units per week, which is a 97% decrease from the summer peak (over 200 units). On-hand inventory is 237 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 45 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that there are no further periods to plan for and the inventory level is vastly in excess of any possible demand for the remainder of the year (and likely well into the next year's spring), the goal remains to prevent any further procurement. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, but as there are no units in-transit and no orders planned, L and sigma_hat settings are secondary to ensuring mu_hat reflects the reality of the inventory surplus. I will maintain the draining strategy by setting L and sigma_hat to default and mu_hat to a minimal level via the recent_N method based on the late-December demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (Dec): Demand has stabilized at a floor of ~5 units/week (P44-P46), representing effectively zero seasonal relevance.
