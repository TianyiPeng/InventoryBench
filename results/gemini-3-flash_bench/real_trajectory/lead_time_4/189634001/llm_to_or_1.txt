Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 189634001 (Long Leg Leggings). On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 52.8 units per week (values: 54, 60, 52, 52, 46) and a standard deviation of 5.1 units. Since we are in the 'Divided Basics' / 'Jersey Basic' category, demand is expected to be relatively stable, though it may trend slightly down following the post-holiday January period. Given that there is no historical lead time feedback yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of 52.8, mu_hat should be approximately 264. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent statistics while the OR engine manages the safety stock based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the history, the demand in Period 1 was 201 units, which is significantly higher than the initial samples (average ~53). This corresponds to the mid-February period, often seeing a lift in basic apparel demand. There is a massive stockout: 0 on-hand inventory vs 201 demand. An order of 62 was placed in Period 1 but has not arrived yet (promised lead time is 4). To recover, I need to adjust mu_hat to reflect the new, higher demand regime. I will use the last 5 samples plus the observed Period 1 demand. Calculating the mean of (54, 60, 52, 52, 46, 201) gives approx 77.5. With L=4, mu_hat (1+L)*mean would be 5 * 77.5 = 387.5. Given the extreme stockout, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to allow the OR backend to incorporate this spike, while keeping L at 'default' (4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic jersey leggings SKU. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was stable around 53 units/week. However, Period 1 saw a massive spike to 201 units, followed by 77 units in Period 2. The Period 1 spike is likely a seasonal promotion or stock-out recovery signal, given the product type (Divided Basics). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 240 units in transit (62 from P1, 178 from P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is not expected until Period 5. To account for the recent demand volatility and the high initial spike while acknowledging the subsequent drop, I will use a recent_N method for demand (N=2) to bridge the historical average (53) and the recent spike (avg ~139). For Sigma, I'll use recent_N (N=2) to capture the increased uncertainty. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 1 (201 units) vs historical average (~53), potentially signaling a seasonal shift or promotional event.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Jersey Leggings (Divided Basics), which are a high-volume staple. Historical demand was ~53, but Period 1 saw a massive spike to 201 units, followed by 77 and 57. The Period 1 spike has heavily skewed the average. However, demand is still trending higher than the pre-game history (mean of 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 was 52.8). Currently, on-hand is 0 with 524 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from Period 1 (62 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Since we have no closed arrival data yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the game-start behavior (201, 77, 57), which averages 111.6 per period. This acknowledges the spike while transitioning toward the more recent, lower values. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility introduced by the 201 demand spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a higher safety stock during this period of uncertainty.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 'Long Leg Leggings', a basic garment. Historically, demand was stable around 53 units/week. However, Period 1 saw a significant outlier/spike of 201 units, while Periods 2-4 returned to more normal levels (77, 57, 50). The average of the last 3 periods is 61.3, and the average of the last 4 periods is 96.25. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, the first order placed in Period 1 (62 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (making it visible in Period 6's conclude message). Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 706 units, reflecting orders from P1-P4. To avoid over-ordering after the P1 spike while accounting for the slight elevation in P2, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent mean of ~96.25, and default for sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the P1 spike. This ensures we maintain a sufficient pipeline for the (L+1) coverage window.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Long Leg Leggings'. Demand analysis: Period 1 saw a massive spike (201), but periods 2-5 have stabilized around 61 (77, 57, 50, 60). The early spike appears to be an outlier or a specific event rather than a sustained regime shift. The 5-week average is 89, while the last 4 weeks average is 61. Lead time: The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Inventory: On-hand is 2, and we have 644 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). These are due to arrive in P6, P7, and P8 respectively. Since the stock-out in P1-P4 was due to the lead time gap, and the pipeline (644) is very large relative to current demand (~61), we need to avoid over-ordering. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable post-spike regime (~61/week) while ignoring the Period 1 outlier, and default for lead time as the promise is holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~61 units/period after Period 1 spike (201); Promised lead time of 4 periods confirmed by Period 1 arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Historical demand showed a massive outlier in P1 (201), but has since stabilized. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is 58.4 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5 and P6. Currently, we have 132 units on hand and a large pipeline of 466 units (ordered in P3 and P4). These 466 units are expected to arrive in P7 and P8 based on the lead time of 4. With an inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of 598 units, we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon (estimated demand 5 * 60 = 300). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability and ignore the P1 outlier. Lead time is set to default as the promised 4 periods is accurate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The inventory position is high: On-hand is 343 units with 182 units in-transit (expected to arrive this period based on the confirmed lead time of 4). Combined, we have 525 units against a demand average of ~62 units/period. The current stock covers roughly 8 periods of demand, well above the L+1 (5 period) target. The high demand spike in Period 1 (201) was an outlier; demand has since stabilized with a mean of 61.6 units over the last 5 periods (77, 57, 50, 60, 48, 73). To prevent further excess inventory and associated holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the stabilized post-spike demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Long Leg Leggings'. The historical demand before Period 1 was stable (~53), but Period 1 saw a massive spike (201), followed by a lower, slightly elevated plateau. In the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand has averaged 62.5 units (60, 48, 73, 69). The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Currently, we have 456 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given a lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~63, the required base stock is approximately 315 units plus a safety buffer. Since current on-hand inventory (456) significantly exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly skip ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current stable demand regime (averaging ~63) and exclude the outlier in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-8 has stabilized at an average of 62.5 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 begins with an on-hand inventory of 410 units and 0 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders from Periods 1 through 4. Demand has stabilized after the initial Period 1 spike (201). Over the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9), demand has averaged 59.2 units (60, 48, 73, 69, 46). With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. Current inventory (410) significantly exceeds the projected base stock for (L+1=5) periods of demand (~300-350 units), meaning no order will be placed by the OR backend. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the stable post-spike regime, and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189634001' (Leggings) has shown a demand stabilization following an initial outlier in Period 1 (201 units). Over the last 6 periods (P5-P10), demand has averaged 56.16 units, with a slight downward trend in the most recent two weeks (46 and 41). The on-hand inventory is currently high at 369 units, which is significantly above the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods * ~56 units = 280 units). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high stock level and high holding cost relative to profit (1:4 ratio), the priority is to avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer. I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-spike stabilization while excluding the outlier from Period 1. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-10 has stabilized at an average of 56 units/period, down slightly from the previous average of 62.5.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have observed a consistent downward trend in demand over the last four weeks (Period 8: 69, P9: 46, P10: 41, P11: 37). The average demand for these four periods is 48.25 units, significantly lower than the previous regime. We are currently overstocked with 332 units on-hand and zero pipeline inventory, as all previous large orders from P1-P4 have arrived. Given the lead time (L=4) and current demand trend, our current stock covers approximately 6-8 periods of demand. To minimize holding costs while the backend processes its replenishment policy, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the more recent, lower demand regime using N=4. I will also use N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility in this lower demand period. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 9: Average weekly demand has dropped to 41.3 units (P9-P11) from 62.5 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to early March/April. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand values were 46, 41, 37, and 45, averaging 42.25 units per period. This confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 12). On-hand inventory is high (287 units), covering approximately 6-7 periods of demand at the current rate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level aligned with the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time and sigma_hat will use default/calculate methods as no variance or delivery shifts are currently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~42 units/period (P9-P12) following the drop from ~60 units/period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) has shown a sustained decrease. From Period 9 to 13, the average weekly demand has been ~40 units (specifically 46, 41, 37, 45, 31), compared to the earlier regime of ~60 units and the initial Period 1 spike of 201. On-hand inventory is currently 256 units, which is significantly high given the current demand rate and a total lead time + review cycle of 5 periods (expected demand ~200 units). There are no units in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (P9-P13), which will allow the inventory level to naturally deplete through demand before the OR backend triggers a new order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P9 to P13 has stabilized at ~40 units/period, confirming a downward shift from the previous ~60 units/period (P5-P8).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. On-hand inventory is 211 units with zero in-transit. Demand since Period 9 (2019-04-08) has consistently averaged 40.83 units (samples: 46, 41, 37, 45, 31, 45), which is a clear downward shift from the earlier average of ~61. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period, the target stock should cover 5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate, 211 units provides cover for approximately 5.1 periods (211 / 40.83), meaning we are currently in a slight overstock position relative to the new demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6, from P9 to P14) to lock in this lower demand profile and prevent unnecessary ordering until inventory levels naturally deplete. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~41 units/period from Period 9 to Period 14, confirming a significant reduction from the previous ~61 unit average.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 189634001 (Long Leg Leggings) has shown a clear regime shift. After an early peak, demand averaged ~61 units (P5-P8) and then dropped to ~41 units (P9-P14). Period 15 showed a slight uptick to 60 units, but it is too early to declare a new regime shift back to higher demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in history (P5-P8 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 151 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current average rate (~40-45 units/week). Total pipeline inventory is 156 (151 on-hand + 5 in-transit). Given the high holding cost relative to profit (H=$1, P=$4), maintaining excessive stock is costly. I will use a recent window (N=7, covering P9-P15) for demand and lead time calculations to reflect the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent P15 fluctuation. This will result in a base stock level lower than current inventory, leading the OR engine to place no further orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has transitioned from a high-demand regime in early spring (~61 units/period between P2-P8) to a lower, stable summer base. Since P9 (beginning of April), average demand has been approximately 44 units per period (P9-P16: 46, 41, 37, 45, 31, 45, 60, 54). The last two periods (60 and 54) show a slight uptick, possibly due to early June seasonality, raising the 8-period mean to 47.25. The on-hand inventory is 97 units with 64 units in-transit (ordered P15 and P16), totaling 161 units of pipeline inventory. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given the recent trend, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime while accounting for the recent slight increase. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P9 to P16 has stabilized at an average of ~47 units/period, showing a slight increase in late May/early June from the previous ~41 unit average.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) has settled into a stable regime following a massive outlier in Period 1 and a subsequent downward shift. Since Period 9, the weekly demand mean is approximately 43.4 units (P9-P17). Recent weeks (P15-P17) show demand of 60, 54, and 34, indicating slight volatility but consistent with a mid-40s average. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With 63 units on-hand and 124 in-transit (ordered P15, P16, P17), the pipeline covers several weeks of demand. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable regime since P9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the lower demand compared to the early periods and ensure the OR engine maintains a cost-effective safety stock based on current consumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P9 to P17 has stabilized at an average of ~43.4 units/period, down from the ~60 units seen in early spring.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is basic jersey leggings. Historical demand analysis shows a high initial spike in February (P1: 201), followed by stabilization around ~60 units (P5-P8), and a subsequent drop to a lower regime starting around P9. For the period P9-P18, demand has averaged 41.5 units per period. The last two periods (P17: 34, P18: 32) suggest demand is currently on the lower end of that range. On-hand inventory is 31, and in-transit is 173 (composed of orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in the past (P1-P4 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). Therefore, the P15 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 19. Total pipeline inventory + on-hand (204 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average rate (~41 units). I will use recent_N to capture the current lower demand regime (N=10, covering P9-P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P9 to P18 has stabilized at an average of 41.5 units/period, significantly lower than the P5-P8 average of ~61 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The product is long leg jersey leggings. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 9. The average demand from P9 to P19 is approximately 40.5 units per period. The most recent shipment (ordered P15) arrived on time in P19 (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable. On-hand inventory is low (6 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 195 units (orders from P16-P19), which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods * ~40 units = 200 units). I will use a recent N of 11 (covering Periods 9-19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR system from over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P9 to P19 has stabilized at an average of 40.5 units per period with lower volatility compared to the spring season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower-volume regime beginning around Period 9 (April). Over the last 11 periods (P10-P20), the average demand is approximately 40.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of 8.8. This is a significant drop from the spring peak (~62 units/period). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by arrivals for orders from P15 and P16. I will use recent_N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, lower-demand summer regime. This ensures we don't over-order based on the high historical demand from February and March, effectively balancing service levels against holding costs during the slower summer months.

The current date is July 8th, 2019. The demand regime for SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) has effectively stabilized in a low-summer trough, contrasting with the high demand seen in early spring. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been consistently low and stable (34, 32, 30, 32, 33), averaging approximately 32.2 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 60 units, and there are 127 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 19, 20, and 21 exactly 4 periods after ordering. Given the low volatility and consistent demand level, I will use a N=5 window for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent summer stability. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1) window (approx. 161 units) while minimizing holding costs on this low-margin/high-holding-cost item.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (P17-P21): Demand stabilized at ~32 units/period, significantly lower than the P5-P8 spring average of ~61 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Long Leg Leggings' has stabilized into a summer trough. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 31.83 units (34, 32, 30, 32, 33, 30), which is a significant drop from the spring average of ~61 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from P15, P16, P17, and P18. On-hand inventory is 79 units, with 78 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, and P21). Given the current low-demand regime (~32 units/period), the total pipeline of 157 units (79 on-hand + 78 in-transit) covers nearly 5 periods of demand, which is sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower summer demand regime and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility. L will remain at the promised default of 4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is basic jersey leggings. Demand has been in a summer trough (averaging ~32 units from P17-P22). However, Period 23 showed a jump to 50 units, which might signal the start of 'Back to School' preparations or a minor seasonal uptick. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (P15-P19 all arrived with L=4). For Period 24, on-hand inventory is 56 and in-transit is 56 (from P20, P21, P22, P23). Average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is 37 units. To capture the recent low-demand regime while weighting the recent uptick slightly, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect recent volatility. L will stay at the default promised value.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand uptick detected in Period 23 (50 units) following the summer trough (~32 units), potentially the start of a late-summer/back-to-school recovery.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) has recently stabilized after a summer trough (approx. 32 units/period in June/July). Period 23 saw a spike to 50, but Period 24 returned to 28. Averaging the last 6 periods (P19-P24) gives a mean of ~33.8, while the last 2 periods (P23-P24) average 39. Given the upcoming 'Back to School' season (August), a slight upward adjustment in demand is prudent. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this stable lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower summer regime while remaining sensitive to the start of a late-summer uptick. Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P19 to P24 stabilized at ~34 units/period, with a brief outlier in P23 (50). July demand remains significantly lower than spring peaks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand shows a summer trough (~34 units/period from P19-P24). However, the last period (P25) saw a significant increase to 62 units, and the previous period (P23) hit 50 units. This pattern, combined with the 'Back-to-School' season (August), suggests a regime shift from summer lows toward higher autumn demand for jersey leggings. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. Orders from P22 (0 units), P23 (5 units), P24 (46 units), and P25 (48 units) are in transit (totaling 99 units). On-hand inventory is low at 17 units. Considering the (L+1) = 5 period outlook, the system needs to cover both the immediate stockout risk and the anticipated higher demand. I'll use recent_N (N=7 to capture the trough and the current uptick) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to adapt to the increasing mean and volatility seen in late July/early August.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 25 (62 units), signaling the end of the summer trough (~34 units) and the likely start of the back-to-school demand spike for jersey leggings.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 (jersey leggings) is entering the mid-August back-to-school period. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 1 (late Feb, ~201 units) and a recent uptick to 62 units in Period 25. Period 26 demand was 42 units, but only 17 units were sold due to a stockout (on-hand is 0). Current in-transit quantity is 159 (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26), with the P22 order having arrived (confirming stable 4-period lead time). Period 23's order (5 units) is expected to arrive this period. Given the stockout and the seasonal transition towards autumn, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand increase (approx 51 units/period) while accounting for the likely upward shift as we distance from the summer trough. The OR backend needs to replenish inventory quickly to meet the late-summer/early-autumn demand recovery.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Demand in P25 (62) and P26 (42) significantly exceeds the summer average (P19-P24 avg: ~34). Resulted in stockout at P26 conclude.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory: 0) as back-to-school demand continues to rise. The date is August 19, 2019. Observations from P25-P27 (62, 42, 53 units) confirm a significant demand recovery compared to the summer trough (avg ~32). This align with seasonal expectations for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' as school resumes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out for two consecutive periods, our priority is to increase the safety stock to meet the higher demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent three-week demand trend (avg ~52.3) of the back-to-school phase. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime. Note: The P23 order (5 units) arrived in P27 as expected; the P24 order (46 units) is expected to arrive in P28.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in the 'Back-to-School' (BTS) demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) has been 62, 42, 53, and 64, averaging 55.25 units/period. This is a significant increase from the summer trough average (~34). We have experienced stockouts in P26, P27, and P28 because the on-hand inventory was insufficient to meet this elevated demand. Incoming shipments from P25 (48 units), P26 (60 units), P27 (73 units), and P28 (54 units) are in the pipeline. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these will arrive in P29, P30, P31, and P32 respectively. To respond to this higher demand regime and mitigate current stockouts while considering the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio (which suggests a ~80% service level), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the BTS spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime confirmed (P25-P28): Average demand has increased to ~55 units/period from the summer average of ~34 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, the height of the back-to-school season. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (P25-P29 average: ~53 units/period) compared to the summer trough (~34 units). Despite consistent arrivals (L=4 confirmed), the high demand and low starting inventory have led to frequent stockouts (P26, P27, P28). At the start of Period 30, we have very low on-hand inventory (4 units) but a significant pipeline (248 units). To ensure we capture the remaining seasonal demand while accounting for the high lead-time (L=4), mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the back-to-school shift. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this period. This approach will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the elevated demand through the lead time plus current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime (P25-P29) confirmed at ~53 units/period, showing significant growth from the summer trough.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the 'back-to-school' demand regime (P25-P30), where demand has averaged 51.5 units per period (62, 42, 53, 64, 44, 44). This is a significant increase from the summer trough (~34 units). Promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (most recent arrival from Period 26 arrived in Period 30). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current regime (P25-P30) specifically. This ensures we maintain enough stock for (L+1) periods (approx 257.5 units) while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory (currently 220 units in-transit). The inventory position is recovering from the recent stockouts, and following this regime mean will help maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) has entered a stable back-to-school/autumn demand regime following the summer trough. Analysis of recent demand from Period 25 to 31 shows a consistent step-up, with weekly values of 62, 42, 53, 64, 44, 44, and 59. The mean demand for this 7-period regime is approximately 52.3 units per period. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of Period 27's order in Period 31). Current on-hand inventory is 34 units, with 183 units in-transit. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this specific post-summer regime. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current (5+1) period cycle of demand at the higher autumn rate while accounting for observed volatility. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts like those seen in Periods 26-28 while minimizing holding costs as the regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime (P25-P31) stabilized at an average of ~52.3 units/period, up from the summer average of ~34 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 (jersey leggings) is currently in a stable autumn/back-to-school demand regime. Analyzing the period from P25 to P32, the demand has stabilized at an average of 53.6 units per period (62, 42, 53, 64, 44, 44, 59, 60). The most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) average 54.3 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P28's order in P32. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 28) but the pipeline is healthy (193). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the full back-to-school regime (P25-P32) and sigma_hat using the same window to address the moderate volatility (~8.8 units SD) observed in this cluster. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time + review period (5 periods) at the 80% service level implied by the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation in Period 33 (109 units) is a significant spike and potential outlier, but more likely reflects the onset of a new demand regime (possibly late-autumn or early-winter transition for leggings). The average demand for the 'Back-to-School' regime (P25-P32) was approximately 54 units. Including P33, the recent 9-period average rises to 60 units. Given the stockout in Period 33 (ending on-hand 0) and the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this recent upward trend and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the increased variance. This ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to protect against the current demand surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 33 (109 units), increasing the P25-P33 average to 60 units/period from the previous average of 54. This may indicate a new late-autumn seasonal shift.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a high-demand autumn regime. P33 saw a massive spike of 109 units, while P34 was 54 units. The average demand since P25 (the start of the autumn/back-to-school recovery) is approximately 60 units per period. The item is currently stocked out with 0 on-hand inventory, although 258 units are in-transit. An arrival of 36 units (ordered on P31) is expected during P35, which will be insufficient covering the current demand levels (avg ~60-70). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have experienced recent stockouts (P33, P34), I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher late-autumn demand (avg ~58) while accounting for the P33 volatility. N=10 focuses on the regime since P25 while including enough samples to stabilize the mean. I will use the same N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility from the recent spike.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189634001' (Jersey Leggings) has entered a late-autumn demand surge. Demand in P33 (109), P34 (54), and P35 (83) indicates a significant upward shift from the early-autumn average of ~52. The current 3-period average (P33-P35) is 82 units, compared to the P25-P32 average of ~52. On-hand inventory is at 0 due to consecutive stockouts. Our 'In-transit' pipeline of 296 units covers orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35. To address the current surge and recover from stockouts, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~82) and use recent_N=11 (P25-P35) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the autumn season. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge confirmed (P33-P35): Average demand increased to ~82 units/period from the early-autumn average (P25-P32) of ~52 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a late-autumn demand surge for jersey leggings. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 36 is approximately 77.5 units per period (109, 54, 83, 64), which is significantly higher than the earlier autumn average of 52 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to consecutive periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (sales capped by availability in periods 33, 34, 35). Pipeline inventory is 347 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period window to capture this higher regime (average ~77.5 * (1+4) = 387.5) and keep sigma_hat based on the same window to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this base stock (approx 387.5 + safety stock) minus the pipeline of 347.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge confirmed (P33-P36): Average demand increased to ~77.5 units/period from the early-autumn average (P25-P32) of ~52 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a late-autumn demand regime for leggings, which has shown increased volatility and higher peaks compared to early autumn. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 70.4 units, though there was a significant spike to 109 in P33 and a dip to 42 in P37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (22) and the system has been struggling with stockouts from P33-P36. We have a significant pipeline (370 units total), including a large order of 115 from P36. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent high volatility and the approaching holiday season (early November), I will use the last 5 periods to estimate demand (mu) and volatility (sigma). Setting N=5 for both captures the current 'late-autumn' regime shift while allowing the OR backend to prioritize a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P33-P37) shows increased volatility with an average of ~70 units/period, up from the early-autumn average of ~52 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 (Jersey Leggings) is currently in a late-autumn/pre-winter demand phase. Period 39 (Nov 4) follows a high-volatility period (P33-P37) where demand averaged ~77 units, followed by two lower-demand periods (P37: 42, P38: 43). This drop likely reflects a temporary stabilization or the gap before a winter holiday surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 73 units on-hand and 286 in-transit, there is significant pipeline inventory. However, the 'cap' logic in the OR backend will prevent over-ordering if base stock is set too high. To address the recent volatility and potential for a late-year spike, I will use a 6-period window (P33-P38) to capture the higher mean and standard deviation of the late-autumn regime. This balances the recent lower observations (42, 43) with the preceding surges (109, 83, 64) to maintain a safety buffer without incurring excessive holding costs if demand remains at the 40-50 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P33 to P38 has shown high volatility (range 42-109) with a mean of ~64 units/period, significantly higher than the early Autumn average of ~52.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late-autumn period for jersey leggings. Demand has shown high volatility recently (ranging from 42 to 109 units), but the last three periods (P37-P39) have settled into a lower range (42, 43, 49), averaging ~45 units. This is a noticeable step down from the P33-P36 surge avg of ~77.5 units. Current inventory status is healthy with 98 units on-hand and 232 units in-transit (P36: 115, P37: 87, P38: 10, P39: 20). The large P36 shipment (115 units) is expected to arrive this period (P40), which will significantly increase on-hand inventory. Given the observed recent stabilization and the impending large arrival, I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand to capture the late-autumn average (60.6 units) while smoothing the extreme P33 spike, and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period lead time remains consistent. This approach maintains a safe base stock while preventing excessive overstocking as we move further into November.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P33 to P39 has stabilized at an average of ~61 units/period, down from the P33-P36 peak, with recent weeks (P37-P39) averaging a lower ~45 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for jersey leggings has stabilized over the last four periods (P37-P40) at an average of 44.25 units per period, following a volatile late-autumn surge that peaked in P33 and P35. This stabilization suggests a move toward a late-year baseline before potential holiday shifts. Inventory levels are now healthy with 170 units on-hand and an arrival of 87 units expected from the P37 order. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets a high service level (~80%). I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (P33-P40 avg ~61) while acknowledging the recent dip to ~44. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the (L+1) horizon while preventing excessive overstocking as demand cools from its October peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 37 has stabilized at a lower average of ~44 units/period compared to the P33-P36 peak of ~77.5 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical data and recent demand trends (P37-P41) confirm a stabilized demand regime averaging 41.6 units/period, down from the October surge which peaked at ~80 units. This decline is consistent with the late-autumn patterns observed in the carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently high (226 units), which is sufficient to cover approximately 5.4 periods of current demand. Pipeline inventory (93 units) includes orders from P38 (10), P39 (20), P40 (34), and P41 (29), all of which are expected to arrive within the next 4 periods. Given the high stock level and lower demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~42) and prevent further inventory accumulation. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the significantly reduced volatility compared to the October spike. L remains at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistently reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 37 to 41 has stabilized at an average of 41.6 units/period, confirming a return to baseline levels after the late-autumn (October) surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25), we observed a massive demand spike of 175 units, significantly diverging from the previous 5-week average of ~42 units. This spike aligns with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail week. Given the date of Period 43 (2019/12/2), we are now entering the peak December holiday shopping season. Historical data from Period 1 (Feb 2019) also showed a spike, suggesting this SKU is prone to high-volume events. I am transitioning the demand forecast to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture both the pre-spike baseline and the current surge, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat higher to ensure enough inventory for the holiday weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Sustained seasonal demand surge detected starting Period 42 (175 units), coinciding with Black Friday and the start of the December holiday season. Demand volatility has increased significantly.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/9). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 175 units (Black Friday), and Period 43 followed with 116 units. The product is 'Jersey Basic Leggings', a high-volume staple likely gifted or purchased for layering in winter. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after being stocked out in Period 43. Pipeline inventory stands at 217 units (34 from P40, 29 from P41, 0 from P42, and 154 from P43). Given the consistent 4-period lead time, the 154 units ordered last period won't arrive until Period 47. To prevent further lost sales during the December peak and capture any late-month surge or post-holiday demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to focus exclusively on the holiday regime (avg ~145.5). This justifies a high order to cover the remainer of the season and safety stock for high volatility (sigma_hat also focused on the last 2 periods of high variance).

Carry-over insight: Holiday December peak confirmed: Periods 42-43 show a mean demand of 145.5 units/period, up from the late November baseline (~42), representing a 246% increase.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the middle of the peak holiday season. Demand peaked in P42 (175 units) and P43 (116 units), but dropped unexpectedly to 30 units in P44. This drop to 30 in P44 is likely a stockout-induced demand distortion or a temporary lull before the final pre-Christmas surge. Historical data from P1 (Feb) shows a massive spike of 201 units, suggesting the product (jersey leggings) is susceptible to high-volume spikes. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in P49, which is mid-January. We expect high demand for the remainder of December (P45, P46) and potentially the final period P47. The Pipeline (398 units) contains large orders from P43 (154) and P44 (215), which are scheduled to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively. Because we are nearing the end of the simulation (P47), and current on-hand is very low (4), we must ensure the backend maintains a high base stock to cover remaining holiday demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the holiday surge (avg ~107) and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period lead time has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed: P42-P44 average demand is 107 units/period, despite a low P44 (30) likely due to late-season variance or stockout recovery.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/23). Recent demand history shows a massive surge: P42 (175), P43 (116), P44 (30 - likely stockout suppressed), and P45 (166). This reflects the high volatility and volume typical of the pre-Christmas and post-Christmas sale period for jersey basics. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P42-P45) is 121.75 units. However, given the immediate proximity to the holiday peak and the likelihood of post-holiday clearance demand, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this high-volume regime. The OR backend's inventory calculation ($base\_stock - pipeline\_inventory$) shows a pipeline of 596 units (from orders in P43, P44, and P45), which covers the next several periods of this high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly increased holiday volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Christmas/New Year period (Dec 30). Demand remains high (P45: 166, P46: 121) compared to the November baseline (~42), reflecting the peak holiday season for jersey leggings. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). However, the massive orders placed during the December surge (P43: 154, P44: 215, P45: 227) are in-transit. The order from P42 (0 units) arrived in P46, but since it was 0, no stock was added. The order from P43 (154 units) is expected to arrive during Period 47 (now), and P44 (215 units) in Period 48. These will soon satisfy backorders and demand. Given the stockout and extremely high recent demand (P42-P46 mean: ~121.6), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime. This period is P47, and the next few periods (January) usually see a sharp decline in holiday apparel demand as festive activities conclude. To avoid excessive overstocking (holding cost $1.0 vs profit $4.0) during the imminent January drop-off, the OR backend's capping mechanism will be vital. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand (P42-P46) averaged ~121.6 units per period, representing nearly a 3x increase over autumn baselines. Significant inventory inflow (596 units) is expected between P47-P49.
