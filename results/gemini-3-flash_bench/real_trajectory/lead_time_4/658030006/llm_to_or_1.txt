Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73. This suggests a strengthening demand regime, likely due to pre-spring shopping for denim products like jeggings. The most recent demand (73) is significantly higher than the initial average. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4, the order-up-to level must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this upward movement (average of 59, 55, 73 = 62.33) while allowing for some variability. Since there are no concluded periods yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket jeggings'. Historically, demand has been increasing (39, 38, 59, 55, 73, 64). The last four samples (59, 55, 73, 64) suggests a higher demand regime compared to the first two. In Period 1, we ordered 78 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect them to arrive until Period 5. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 78 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 64, but we sold 0 due to 0 on-hand inventory (lost sales). To maintain service levels for this growth, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 samples where demand shifted upward. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a staple ladies' denim item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a clear upward trend: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73, and recent periods 64, 62. The mean of the last 4 periods (55, 73, 64, 62) is approx 63.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0 because initial orders haven't arrived yet (promised lead time 4). Since L=4, we must cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit is 154 (78+76). Total pipeline needed is ~63.5 * 5 = 317.5. I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime observed starting late January. I will stick to the default L=4 for now as no orders have concluded yet to prove otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting late Jan: Average weekly demand increased from ~38 to ~63 (+65%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 'Ladies Denim Trousers', a staple fashion item. Examining the history: Period 1 demand was 64, Period 2 was 62, and Period 3 dropped to 38. The mean demand across these 3 periods plus the 5 provided historical samples (39, 38, 59, 55, 73) is approximately 53.5. However, there was a noted regime shift in late Jan where demand averaged ~63. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 230 units in-transit (orders from P1: 78, P2: 76, P3: 76). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at P6 start). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0) because on-hand is 0 and no shipments have arrived yet. I will set L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (P3, P2, P1, and the last 2 historical samples) to capture the higher recent demand trend (avg ~60) while acknowledging the P3 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim), and current historical demand shows a mean of ~53 units per week (samples: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73, 64, 62, 38, 51). While Carry-Over Insights noted a regime shift, recent samples (P3-P4) showed a slight dip (38 and 51), making the mean roughly 52.8 across all samples. On-hand remains 0, with 310 units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the Timing Example, an order placed in P1 with L=4 arrives in the arrival phase of P5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at P6). Thus, we haven't seen any arrivals yet, which is expected. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand volatility (mean ~57.6) and set L to default. This ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock to cover (4+1) periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first order placed in Period 1 (78 units) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of L=4 (Arrival in P5 - Order in P1 = 4). Current inventory is low (On-hand: 10) because demand has been consistently high. The demand history (39, 38, 59, 55, 73, 64, 62, 38, 51, 68) shows a shift. While Period 3 conclude showed a dip (38), the surrounding periods confirm a higher regime. The average of the last 5 samples is 56.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and level. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing historical data: Period 1 arrived in P5 and Period 2 arrived in P6, confirming a consistent lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim) shows a recent shift. Pre-period 1 demand was lower, but post-Period 1 demand (P1-P6) averages 56.3 units/week. Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 weeks (P2-P6), the average is 54.8 units. The 'carry_over_insight' noted an increase, but current demand has stabilized around the mid-50s to low-60s. Given the stable demand pattern and confirmed lead time, I will set L to 4 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stable demand since mid-February, covering the (1+L)=5 instruction. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. On-hand is 31, and pipeline (in-transit) is 242, which generally covers the expected lead-time demand, but the OR backend will refine the order based on these parameters.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. Historical demand shows a post-January stabilization around 60-70 units per week, with a recent spike to 94 units in Period 7, likely reflecting early spring fashion demand for 'Push Up Jeggings'. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). With on-hand inventory at 13 units and demand currently averaging ~61.5 units since Period 1 (and higher recently), the system needs to maintain a robust pipeline. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~65 units/period (average of P3-P7), adjusted for the lead time (1+L=5). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge detected: Period 7 demand was 94 units, significantly above the post-January average of ~63.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in Period 6 and validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The current SKU is 'Push Up Jegging', a fashion staple. Demand analysis shows a recent surge: while the earlier average was around 63, Period 7 hit 94. Although Period 8 dropped back to 52, we are entering the spring fashion season where demand for denim typically remains elevated or volatile. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 67.25. Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 41 on-hand + 227 in-transit = 268. An average of 67.25 over 5 periods is 336.25, suggesting we are still slightly under-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand spring environment while utilizing the 'calculate' method for lead time since the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-April (2019/4/15). Historically, the last three periods (P7-P9) have shown volatile demand (94, 52, 37), likely reflecting a transition from an early spring surge to more normalized spring levels for this denim item. The average demand across these last three periods is 61, which aligns with the overall post-January average (~63) identified in Period 3. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand at 32 and in-transit at 298 (covering 4+ upcoming periods), the system has significant pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 5-9) to capture the current demand cluster (average ~61.2) while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance seen in P7. This balances the risk of another spike with the current relative lull.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P6). The product is 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jeggings'. Looking at the demand history, there was a surge in early March (P7 demand = 94), but the last three weeks have seen a significant decline (P8: 52, P9: 37, P10: 24). This suggests the 'Spring surge' noted in previous carry-over insights was short-lived or shifted as we move deeper into spring. The current on-hand inventory is 66, and there are 295 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Given the sharp decline in demand over the last 3 weeks (averaging ~37.7 units compared to the older average of ~63), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering, while maintaining the default lead time of 4. This will set the base stock level relative to the recent lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-Spring surge demand has declined significantly over the last 3 periods (P8-P10), averaging 37.7 units/week compared to previous regime of ~63.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since the spring surge (P7 demand was 94), demand has entered a sustained downward regime. Over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), demand has been 52, 37, 24, and 18, averaging 32.75 units per week. This decline likely reflects the end of the peak spring season for this 'low waist skinny jegging' product. On-hand inventory is currently high (92) and in-transit is also high (251). We need to prevent overstocking as demand cools. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 captures this sharp decline (32.75 * 5 = 163.75), which is far below the current total pipeline of 343 units. This will lead the OR engine to pause ordering. sigma_hat is set to the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-spring demand has declined for 4 consecutive periods (P8-P11), dropping from 52 to 18 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and we are entering Period 13. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has decreased significantly since the spring peak (Period 7: 94 units). Over the last five periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged 35.6 units, but the most recent four weeks (P9-P12) average even lower at 31.5 units. The Carry-over Insights correctly identified a decline. On-hand inventory is high at 142 units, and we have 154 units in-transit (orders from P9-P12). Total pipeline inventory is 296 units, which is approximately 9-10 weeks of current demand coverage. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Since current inventory far exceeds demand for the next 5 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the persistent lower demand regime (avg ~31.5), which will likely result in zero new orders from the OR backend while we draw down excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-spring surge: Period 9-12 demand averages 31.5 units, down from early-Spring average of ~63.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). Historical data shows a clear post-spring demand decline and stabilization. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 33.4 units, a significant drop from the earlier spring peak (~63-94 units). Period 13 demand was 41 units. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 200) due to arrivals from large orders placed during the peak demand period (P8-P9). With an in-transit quantity of 55 (the P10 order) expected to arrive in Period 14, total system inventory is 255 units. Given a lead time of 4, the target base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At the current average demand of ~34 units/week, 255 units already covers nearly 7.5 weeks of supply, which is excessive and will incur high holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized lower demand level. I will use the default lead time (4) as arrivals have been consistently conforming to the promised lead time. This strategy will likely result in zero or minimal orders until the current surplus is depleted.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has stabilized following a spring surge, with the last 6 periods (P9-P14) averaging approximately 35 units per week (37, 24, 18, 47, 41, 43). On-hand inventory is currently high at 212 units, which is significantly more than the anticipated demand for the (L+1) period window (5 weeks * ~35 units = 175 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted, I will transition to a 'recent_N' approach (N=6) to capture this new stabilized demand regime. This will lower the base stock level calculated by the OR backend, causing it to halt ordering until the inventory level falls below the target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed: P9-P14 demand averages 35.0 units/week following the spring surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' denim jeggings. We have entered a stabilized lower-demand regime following the spring surge. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand has averaged 35.8 units/week (37, 24, 18, 47, 41, 43, 40). Period 15 showed an arrival of 0, which is correct as the order placed in P11 was for 0 units. In-transit inventory consists of the 6 units ordered in P15. With 172 units on-hand and stable demand around 36 units, we are currently overstocked. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. My parameters reflect this stabilized demand (recent_N=7) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods to let the OR backend manage the excess inventory while maintaining service levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. Demand for the Push Up Jegging (658030006) has stabilized following a spring surge, with a consistent mean of approximately 39.5 units/week over the last 8 periods (P9-P16: 37, 24, 18, 47, 41, 43, 40, 43). Current on-hand inventory is 129 units, and in-transit inventory is 46 units (ordered P15 and P16). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (observed from P5 to P14). Since the current inventory position (129 + 46 = 175) is sufficient to cover roughly 4.4 periods of demand at the current rate (~40 units/week), and lead time is 4, we are in a balanced position. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the stabilized post-surge demand regime and use the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Average demand from P9-P16 is 39.1 units/week, establishing a clear post-spring regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging' has successfully stabilized following the spring surge. Since Period 9, the weekly demand has averaged approximately 39.1 units. This post-spring regime is far more consistent and lower than the early spring peak. Lead times have been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the game history, though the orders placed in Periods 11-14 were zero, explaining the lack of arrivals in Periods 15-17. The current on-hand inventory is 111 units, with 92 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, and P17). With an expected lead time of 4 periods and a stable demand regime, I will continue to set parameters based on the most recent 9 periods (P9-P17) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs given the lower stable demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' denim jeggings. Demand has entered a stable regime post-spring peak, with the last 10 periods (P9-P18) averaging 33.4 units per week. Although there were periods with zero orders due to high inventory (P11-P14), ordering resumed in P15. No orders arrived during P15-P18, which is consistent with the confirmed 4-period lead time; the P15 order is expected to arrive in P19 (current period), but its conclusion will only be visible in P20. The on-hand inventory is 88, and in-transit inventory is 104 (representing orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spring demand stabilization (P9-P18), and set L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly cooled since the spring peak (Period 7: 94 units). Over the last 11 periods (P9-P19), demand has averaged 31.09 units/week, with the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) even lower at 28.4 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 76 units, and there are 115 units in-transit (P16: 40, P17: 46, P18: 12, P19: 17). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 15 order in Period 19. Given the low-waist skinny jegging style, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as the season progresses into late June. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture the post-surge regime while smoothing out weekly volatility, and use the last 11 samples for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed: P9-P19 demand averages 31.1 units/week, showing a consistent lower-level plateau compared to the spring surge.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historical demand for SKU 658030006 (low-waist jeggings) has stabilized significantly since the spring peak. For the last 12 periods (P9 to P20), demand has averaged approximately 30 units per week. Specifically, over the most recent 10-period interval (P11-P20), demand dropped further to an average of ~28 units, with the most recent sample at 9 units, suggesting a potential summer lull. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P15 and P16 arriving exactly in P19 and P20. With 107 units on hand and 88 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20), the current inventory position is 195 units. This is significantly higher than the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), which at a mean of 30 units would be 150. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this lower post-spring regime, and keep L at default (4) as the behavior is stable at the promised lead time. The high on-hand stock combined with the pipeline inventory should naturally suppress ordering through the backend's capped base-stock policy.

The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline and subsequent stabilization after the spring surge (March/April). Since Period 17, demand has dropped further, with the last five periods (P17-P21) averaging only 14.0 units/week. This suggests we are in a summer low-demand regime for this denim jegging SKU. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 141 units, which is high (approximately 10 weeks of current demand coverage), resulting in significant holding costs. Pipeline inventory consists of 46 units (ordered P18-P21) expected over the next four periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current plateau (~14 units/week), and maintaining L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 17: Average weekly demand decreased from ~31 units to ~14 units (-55%), likely representing a summer seasonal low for denim.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a summer low in demand. Analysis of the recent history shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 17 (early June). Period 17 to 22 demand values were: 18, 23, 18, 9, 12, 18, which averages 16.3 units per week. This is a significant drop from the spring average of ~31 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (135 units) relative to this demand, covering over 8 weeks of stock, while the pipeline has 34 units (ordered in P19, P20, and P21) expected to arrive in the coming weeks. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low demand regime, I will setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this summer trough and minimize further holding costs while our current stock persists.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging' has settled into a low-volume summer regime. For the last 7 periods (P17-P23), demand has been consistently low, averaging 15.7 units per week (min 9, max 23). The previous carry-over insight identifying a shift at Period 17 (avg ~14) is well-supported by recent data. With an on-hand inventory of 140 units and an in-transit pipeline of 17 (from P20 and P21 orders), the stock-to-demand ratio is very high relative to the ~16 units/week demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this low summer regime (mu_hat = (1+4) * 15.7 = 78.5). This will result in a base stock significantly lower than current total inventory (140 + 17 = 157), effectively pausing ordering to reduce high holding costs while maintaining a safe buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed: P17-P23 average demand is 15.7 units/week, a significant decrease from the previous spring average of ~31.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Ladies Denim Trousers) continues to experience its summer low-demand regime. The current date is July 29, 2019. Since Period 17 (early June), weekly demand has consistently averaged approximately 15.7 units (P17-P24: 18, 23, 18, 9, 12, 18, 12, 10). Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods, with the P20 order arriving in P24 as expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (143 units), significantly exceeding the inventory needed to cover the lead time plus review period (5 periods) at the current demand rate (approx 5 * 15.7 = 78.5 units). To minimize further holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the stabilized summer demand regime. The high on-hand inventory will prevent the OR backend from placing new orders until stock levels naturally deplete to the target base stock level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a denim product. Current date is August 5, 2019. We are in a confirmed summer low-demand regime, which typical retail knowledge suggests may last through August before a 'Back to School' or autumn uptick. Since Period 17, weekly demand has averaged 14.3 units (P17-P25), with the most recent sample at 4 units. On-hand inventory is 143 units, which provides roughly 35 periods of coverage at current demand rates (143 / 4) or 10 periods at the regime average (143 / 14). With 0 units in-transit and a lead time of 4, the current stock is extremely high relative to demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9, corresponding to the start of the summer regime at P17) to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until this excess inventory is cleared and to match the current low-volatility environment. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Ladies Denim Trousers) continues to be in a summer low-demand regime. Analysis of demand since Period 17 (early June) shows a sustained low, with an average of approximately 14 units per week and continued volatility (recent demand: 4, then 22). My current on-hand inventory is 121 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time (L) of 4, the order needs to cover at least (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~15/week, I need roughly 75 units to satisfy demand through the lead time. As I have 121 on-hand, I am currently overstocked relative to current demand patterns. I will set L to 4 as established by history, use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the summer trend since Period 17, and set sigma_hat to the recent window as well to account for current volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs on a low-selling item.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging' has shown a notable increase over the last two periods (P26: 22 units, P27: 48 units), compared to the summer low average of ~15 units. This likely signals the start of the 'Back to School' or autumn demand transition for denim products. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is approximately 25 units/week. Since the promised lead time L=4 is confirmed and stable, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to capture this upward momentum and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods). Current on-hand is 73 with 0 in-transit. Setting N=3 for demand parameters allows the system to pivot quickly to this emerging trend while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the increased volatility seen in the P27 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 27: Demand increased to 48 units, following a summer low average of ~15/week, signaling the start of the autumn denim season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1327.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27: 48, P28: 70) clearly signals the start of the autumn denim season, ending the summer low-demand regime (avg ~15). This aligns with late August back-to-school and seasonal shifts. We are currently at a very low on-hand inventory (3 units), though a large order of 62 units was placed last period (P28) and is in-transit. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture this sudden spike, as using a longer window would severely underestimate current demand during this regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1)=5 week horizon, preventing stockouts as the autumn trend matures.

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim season confirmed starting P27: Demand jumped from summer average of ~15 to 48 (P27) and 70 (P28). Higher volatility expected during transition.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is entering the autumn season (September). We've observed a significant demand jump starting at Period 27 (48 units) and Period 28 (70 units), followed by 55 units in Period 29. The current average for this new autumn regime (P27-P29) is 57.7 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently at 0, and we have 147 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P28 and P29). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the recent demand surge, I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the immediate autumn transition. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the higher volatility seen during this transition from summer lows. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation reflects the nearly four-fold increase in weekly demand seen over the last three periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: P27-P29 demand averages 57.7 units/week, transitioning out of the summer low (~15 units/week).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is in the midst of a significant autumn demand surge. Demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) has been 48, 70, 55, and 84, averaging 64.25 units per week. This is a sharp increase from the summer low of ~15 units/week. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand), and there have been no arrivals for five consecutive periods (P26-P30), which is expected as no orders were placed between P22 and P27. However, orders placed since P28 are still within the 4-period lead time. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent autumn trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. I will keep L at default since observed lead times have consistently been 4 when orders were arriving.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P27-P30 demand averages 64.3 units/week, marking a return to high-season denim demand after the summer low.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September autumn peak for denim (Ladies Denim Jeggings). Demand has surged significantly over the last 5 weeks (P27-P31: 48, 70, 55, 84, 126), with the most recent observation of 126 units indicating a strong upward trend. The current mean demand for this autumn regime (N=5) is 76.6 units, but the last two weeks suggest a much higher localized average (~105). Given we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have accumulated significant lost sales (126 demand vs 0 sold in P31), I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this higher volatility and trend. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, mu_hat needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using an expected weekly demand of 90 (conservative against the 126 spike but above the 5-week average), mu_hat = 450. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the transition volatility evidenced by the jump from 84 to 126.

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim peak intensified: Period 31 demand reached 126 units, a 47% increase over the previous week and significantly above the initial autumn average of ~64.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing an intense autumn seasonal peak for denim (jegging). Current date is September 23rd, 2019. Demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) has been: 48, 70, 55, 84, 126, 115. This represents a significant regime shift from the summer low (~15) to a high-season average of approximately 83 units/week. Recent volatility is high as the peak intensifies. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 order arriving in P32). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the entirety of this autumn surge (P27 onwards), which averages 83 units/week (total mu_hat = (1+4)*83 = 415). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=6 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal ramp-up. On-hand is currently 0, with 406 units in-transit (P29-P32 orders), which is nearly aligned with the expected demand over the next lead time plus review period (5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim peak confirmed: P27-P32 demand averages 83 units/week with high volatility (range 48-126).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing an intense autumn demand peak. In Period 33, demand surged to 227 units, a significant jump from the previous weeks (115, 126). This confirms a high-volatility, 'power-peak' phase for denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 447 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent arrivals (P32 and P33 both showed L=4). To capture the recent surge and maintain a high service level for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 (covering the transition starting at P27). This N is chosen to balance the early-autumn growth (avg ~60) with the extremely high demand seen in the last two weeks (115, 227). Given the current stockout and the trajectory of demand, I will also use a recent_N sigma_hat (N=7) to account for the dramatically increased volatility (std dev has likely tripled compared to the summer regime). These parameters aim to increase the base stock level to satisfy the current peak while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim peak intensity confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 227 units, a ~100% increase over the previous week (115) and far exceeding the initial autumn average of ~64. Demand is currently in a hyper-growth/peak phase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand autumn peak. Period 33 saw a massive spike to 227 units, followed by a still-high 135 units in Period 34. Current on-hand is 0, with 576 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (P30 order arrived in P34). Given the extreme volatility and recent triple-digit demands, mu_hat needs to reflect the current peak rather than the long-term average. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the autumn regime (P27-P34). While the OR backend uses a capped policy, providing a high mu_hat and keeping L at default ensures the pipeline target covers the current momentum. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, which the OR engine will target using the provided sigma.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak volatility confirmed: Period 33 (227) and Period 34 (135) show extreme variance compared to the initial autumn average (~64). Demand remains significantly higher than seasonal norms.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant autumn demand peak for denim jeggings. Current demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) has averaged 157 units/week, with a massive spike of 227 in P33. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0 because arrivals (P31 order of 91 units) were immediately exhausted by the P35 demand of 131. The pipeline (In-transit: 661 units) consists of orders from P32 (153), P33 (126), P34 (206), and P35 (176). The P32 order (153 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P36), which should finally help satisfy customer demand. Given the high volatility and the extreme peak observed in P33, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this high-demand regime (avg ~157). I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method as lead times have been consistent. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the extreme variance seen during this autumn surge, ensuring the OR backend maintains a high enough base stock to prevent stockouts during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified: P32-P35 average demand is 157 units/week, significantly higher than the initial autumn average of ~64.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October autumn denim peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has been extremely high and volatile: 115, 227, 135, 131, 127, averaging 147 units/week. While P33 was a hyper-peak (227), demand seems to have stabilized at a new high plateau around 125-135 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 26 units on-hand and high demand, we are still recovering from stockouts. The backend OR logic uses (1+L) * mu_hat, so for L=4, it looks at 5 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this 147 avg plateau. Given the extreme jump from the summer low (15) to this autumn peak (147), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to ensure the safety stock is robust against the high volatility observed in P33 and P34, preventing further stockouts during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed: P34-P36 demand has stabilized around 131 units/week following the P33 hyper-peak of 227.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is currently in its peak autumn denim season. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P34-P37) following an extreme peak in P33. The average demand over these four periods is 126.75 units (135, 131, 127, 114), showing a very slight downward trend but remaining significantly elevated compared to early autumn or summer levels. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently at 38 units, with a substantial pipeline of 666 units. As we are moving further into late October, I expect demand to maintain this plateau before eventually tapering off towards the end of the year. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand plateau for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) window of ~635 units (5 * 127), which helps clear the current stockouts while accounting for the significant in-transit quantities.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed: P34-P37 demand averages 126.8 units/week, maintaining a high-season level after the initial hyper-peaks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is currently in a sustained high-demand denim season (Autumn). Following the hyper-peaks in Periods 33-34, demand has stabilized at a high level. Demand in the last five periods (P34-P38) has been 135, 131, 127, 114, and 167 (avg = 134.8). This confirms the 'Autumn plateau' noted in Carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is 77, and there is a significant pipeline (In-transit) of 460 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent plateau of ~135 units/week to maintain high service levels during this peak season. The backend OR engine will calculate the order size by considering the base stock (approx 5 periods of demand) minus the current pipeline. Given the high in-transit volume (460) compared to projected demand over lead time (5 * 135 = 675), the OR engine will determine if an additional order is necessary to maintain the buffer.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand plateau established: P34-P38 average demand is 134.8 units/week, following the initial seasonal surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Ladies Denim Trousers) remains in its autumn high-demand season. Recent demand (P34-P39) has established a plateau with an average of approximately 129 units per week (135, 131, 127, 114, 167, 99). Although P39 saw a slight dip to 99 units, the overall seasonal trend and the preceding week's high of 167 suggest volatility within a high-demand regime rather than a definitive downturn. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P28 through P35. On-hand inventory is 154, and there is a significant pipeline of 452 units (orders from P36, P37, and P39). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand plateau (avg ~129/week) while allowing for the observed volatility. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the high variance seen during this peak period. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) period horizon while managing the risk of overstocking as we move deeper into November.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand plateau maintained: average demand for P34-P39 is 128.8 units/week with significant weekly volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, deeply within the autumn high-demand season for denim. Demand has stabilized at a high-level plateau; the average demand from Period 34 to 40 is approximately 129.6 units per week. Although there is high weekly volatility (ranging from 99 to 167 in the last 4 weeks), the overall regime is consistent. On-hand inventory is healthy at 247 units, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 348 units, which includes orders from P37 (57 units), P39 (168 units), and P40 (123 units). The Period 37 order is expected to arrive this period (P41). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, P34-P40) to capture this specific high-demand plateau while smoothing out the extreme volatility seen in earlier autumn peaks. Sigma_hat is also set using N=7 to reflect the current high volatility regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the high-demand autumn/winter season for denim jeggings. The 'Autumn high-demand plateau' has been stable since Period 34, with demand averaging approximately 121.5 units per week over the last 8 periods (P34-P41). While there is significant weekly volatility (ranging from 94 to 167), the mean has stabilized following the initial hyper-peak in September. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 210 units, and in-transit inventory (421 units) includes expected arrivals from orders placed in Periods 38-41. To maintain a safe buffer against the high seasonal volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 47), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized high-season mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the current volatility level. L remains at the promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand stabilization confirmed: P34-P41 demand averages 121.5 units/week, maintaining the seasonal plateau with consistent 4-period lead times.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in the peak season for denim. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike to 183 units, well above the recent average of ~121. The period 38 order (0 units) did not arrive this period (which is expected as it was for zero units), so monitoring for the next significant arrival (P39 order of 168 units) in Period 43 is key. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand in Period 42 and the fact that we are approaching the holiday/December peak, I will base the demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime from Period 34 to 42. The mean demand for these 9 periods is (135+131+127+114+167+99+134+94+183)/9 = 131.6. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this autumn/winter high-demand plateau while accounting for the recent spike to 183. Lead time (L) remains 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand peak sustained: Average demand for P34-P42 is 131.6 units/week, with high volatility (range 94-183).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in the late autumn/winter season for denim. Period 43 demand was 35 units, which is a significant drop from the previous 9-week average of ~131.6 units. This potentially signals the end of the high-season peak or a pre-holiday lull. However, denim typically sees another surge during the holiday gifting season later in December. I will use a shorter demand window (N=10) to capture the recent high volatility while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Current on-hand is 160 plus 513 in-transit, totaling 673 units covering the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (avg ~122) to maintain a buffer for potential holiday demand while monitoring if the P43 drop is a sustained regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Potential demand cooling or holiday lull detected; Period 43 demand (35) is significantly below the P34-P42 average of 131.6 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period. Historically, Period 43 (Dec 2) and Period 44 (Dec 9) have shown a significant drop in demand (35 and 69 units respectively) compared to the Autumn plateau mean of 131.6. This likely represents a pre-holiday lull or a cooling trend after the peak season. Current on-hand inventory is healthy (214) and pipeline is very high (478), including large orders from P41 (130), P42 (80), P43 (180), and P44 (88). Given the game ends at Period 47, we have 3 decisions remaining. The total stock accessible (on-hand + in-transit) is 692 units, which covers over 10 periods of the recent lower demand (~60 units) and nearly 5 periods of even the peak demand (131). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the game, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend using a short lookback window (N=3: P42-P44) to capture the drop from peak, and maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Year-end demand cooling confirmed: P43-P44 demand averaged 52 units, a 60% decrease from the P34-P42 autumn high-season mean of 131.6.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is currently in a year-end/holiday cooling phase. Demand in the last three periods (P43-P45) has been 35, 69, and 75, averaging 59.7 units per week. This is a sharp decline from the autumn high-season average of ~131 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 269 units, and there are 420 units in-transit (orders from P42-P45). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given we are at P46 (Dec 23), we anticipate continued lower demand through the end of the year and early January. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this holiday cooling trend while maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for potential stock-out risk if demand rebounds unpredictably in the new year. The current pipeline (689 units total) is sufficient for the next several periods of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Year-end demand cooling sustained: P43-P45 demand averages 59.7 units/week, a ~55% decrease from the autumn high-season mean of 131.6.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the end of December (2019/12/30). The demand for ladies' denim has entered a significant cooling phase following the autumn peak. For the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has been 35, 69, 75, and 31 respectively, averaging approximately 52.5 units per week. This is a sharp contrast to the previous high-season average of ~132 units. With 318 units on-hand and 340 units in-transit (total 658), and a lead time of 4 periods, we are currently overstocked for this new lower-demand regime (estimated 5-week requirement at current demand is ~260 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further inventory buildup and minimize holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat to a recent_N (N=4) method to capture this holiday/year-end slowdown. Sigma is also adjusted to reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Year-end demand cooling confirmed: P43-P46 demand averages 52.5 units/week, down from autumn average of ~132.
