Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for the 'KELLY SHIRT'. This is a cotton blouse, a staple item transitioning from late winter into early spring (Feb 11). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 2, 10, 16, 24 units over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a growing interest as the spring season approaches. Mean demand over the 5 samples is 10.4, but the most recent 3 weeks average 16.6. Given the momentum, I will forecast a slightly higher mean demand than the overall average for the lead time and review period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Therefore, we need to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current growth trend better than the full history. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised value since we have no delivery history yet. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the variability across the full window, which is appropriate given the small sample size and clear trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Shirt in airy cotton', which is seasonally relevant for the approaching spring. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 20 with 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. The historical demand data shows a clear upward trend: 0, 2, 10, 16, 24, and now 20. This suggests a demand regime shift toward the 20-25 units/week range as spring approaches. Promised lead time is 4. An order of 34 units was placed in Period 1 (in-transit), but it will not arrive until Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, our parameters need to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1=5). I will use the last 3 samples (16, 24, 20) to estimate demand mean and variance, which reflects the current higher demand level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-25. The product is a cotton shirt (Kelly Shirt). Historical demand shows a sharp increase: P-4: 0, P-3: 2, P-2: 10, P-1: 16, P0: 24, Period 1 (observed): 20, Period 2 (observed): 55. This suggests a seasonal upward trend as we move into spring (end of February). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 61 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4. Given the lead time, the'arrived=0' messages for Period 1 and 2 are expected. My primary goal is to address the demand surge (from ~20 to 55). I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent high demand (avg of 24, 20, 55 is ~33 per week) and provide a buffer for the upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Feb 2019 (P2: 55 vs previous avg ~15). Retail seasonality for cotton shirts/blouses likely driving volume increases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Demand for the airy cotton shirt has spiked significantly each week (20, 55, 81), confirming the seasonal upward trend noted in the carry-over insights. My current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order from Period 1 isn't expected to arrive until Period 5's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 6). Total demand in the last 3 periods is 156 units, while I have 126 units in transit. Since I am seeing a clear, nearly linear growth trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this acceleration, resulting in a mean of (20+55+81)/3 = 52. With L=4, the backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+4) * 52 = 260. Given the high volatility (sigma) from this rapid growth, I will also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock covers potential further acceleration while avoiding excessive holding costs once the first large shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed as sustained and accelerating: Period 1-3 demand (20, 55, 81) shows a ~30 unit increase per week.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is a 'Kelly Shirt' in airy cotton, which is highly seasonal for spring. Historical demand has shown an aggressive upward trend: 20, 55, 81, 144. The most recent demand (144) is more than double the average of the first three periods. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (34 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 229. Because demand is accelerating rapidly and we are currently stocked out (0 on-hand), the OR backend needs to set a base stock that accounts for this growth. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, while using the promised lead time (L=4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised schedule.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 4 demand (144) shows a doubling versus Period 3 (81), signaling peak spring seasonality for cotton blouses.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18). Demand history shows a strong seasonal ramp-up for this 'airy cotton shirt': 20, 55, 81, 144, 89. The drop from 144 in P4 to 89 in P5 is likely due to stockout (only 34 units were available to sell) rather than a cooling of demand; historical context suggests peak spring/summer seasonality. Our first shipment (P1) arrived in P5 (lead_time=4), confirming the promised lead time holds. We have 364 units in transit (expected arrivals in P6, P7, P8, P9). However, because on-hand is 0 and we have missed substantial demand, we need to set aggressive mu_hat parameters to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to catch up with the seasonal trend. I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (55, 81, 144, 89), which is ~92 per week. With L=4, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)*92 = 460. Sigma_hat should also be elevated to handle the high volatility observed during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: P5 Conclude: Promised lead time of 4 periods confirmed by first arrival (Ordered P1, Arrived P5). Demand remains in high-growth spring regime; P5 sales were capped by inventory availability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $513.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth spring demand regime for the 'KELLY SHIRT'. Historic data and the recent demand trajectory (20, 55, 81, 144, 89, 157) show a clear upward trend, though actual sales have been capped by stockouts since Period 5. The total on-hand is 0, but 491 units are in transit. Cumulative demand over the last 5 periods (excluding P1) averages roughly 105 units per period, but this is likely an underestimate due to stockouts. Given the seasonality of cotton blouses in late March/April, I expect demand to remain high or continue growing. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures the shift from the baseline, and I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and potential underestimation of demand variance during this stockout-heavy growth phase. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains supply-constrained; observed sales (34 in P5, 27 in P6) are actual arrivals, not true demand (89 and 157 respectively). Stockouts for three consecutive periods (P4-P6) confirm that the system is underestimating the spring seasonal peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a cotton blouse, currently in its peak spring seasonality. Analysis of historical demand (P1: 20, P2: 55, P3: 81, P4: 144, P5: 89, P6: 157, P7: 184) shows significant growth, though P5 was an anomaly. Recent demand in P6 and P7 (157 and 184) confirms we are now in a high-volume regime. We have suffered stockouts for 4 consecutive periods (P4-P7) because actual demand is far exceeding the small shipments arriving from the initial periods of lower demand. The promised lead time (L=4) is consistently confirmed (P5, P6, P7 conclusions). With L=4, we must account for 5 periods of demand (current + leading up to arrival). Average demand of the last two periods is ~170. Forecasting 170 units per week over 5 periods results in a mu_hat of 850. I am using recent_N (N=4) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the higher volatility and mean of this spring peak while ignoring the early-season noise. The OR backend needs a high mu_hat to trigger larger orders that catch up to this seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed in high season: P6-P7 demand average is 170 units/week (+140% vs P1-P3 average). Inventory remains supply-constrained due to lead time lag from lower initial orders.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'KELLY SHIRT' is in a high-growth spring demand regime. Seasonal demand has risen significantly, from an initial ~20 units to current levels around 180-190 units (P6-P8 average: 177). History shows consistent stockouts with Ending On-hand = 0 for 8 consecutive periods, meaning we are capturing far less than the actual demand potential. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P4 orders arrived P8). Since the product is an 'airy cotton blouse' in April, we must pivot to a much higher forecast to clear the stockout situation and meet peak seasonal demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 720 (orders from P5-P8). I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value based on the current demand level plus a conservative growth buffer. Calculating (1+L) * Forecast: (1+4) * 210 = 1050. This aggressive setting helps the OR engine overcome the stockout constraint and 'catch up' with the pipeline requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued near ~190 units/week during April-start, confirming a seasonal high for cotton blouses approximately 10x the initial February volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (April 15). The product is a cotton blouse, which saw a massive demand surge through March, peaking at approximately 180-190 units/week (P7-P8). In Period 9, demand dropped to 135 units. While this could be a temporary fluctuation, it may signal the start of a post-Easter/spring peak decline. However, we cannot react too drastically yet as we have been consistently supply-constrained for 4 periods. The lead time of 4 periods is confirmed (P1-P5, P2-P6, etc.). Our 'In-transit' is very high (838 units), reflecting large orders placed recently (P6-P9). The pipeline covers roughly 4.4 weeks of peak demand. To avoid over-ordering if the season is indeed cooling down while maintaining a high service level for current needs, I will use a recent_N average of 4 for demand. This captures the high plateau (P7-P8) and the recent dip (P9), resulting in a safer mean estimate than the full history while staying responsive to the latest signal.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially peaked in late March/early April (~190 units/week) and may be entering a post-peak stability or decline phase (P9 demand: 135).

We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product (airy cotton blouse) has likely passed its peak seasonal demand (late March/early April) and is now in a stable post-peak phase. Looking at the history, true demand peaked around Period 8 (190 units) and has since fallen to 135 (P9) and 141 (P10). Average demand over the last two periods is 138 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since L=4, mu_hat must cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent stability (last 2 periods), 5 * 138 = 690. However, given the high level of inventory currently in-transit (739 units), which was ordered during the peak and will arrive sequentially over the next 4 periods, we must be careful not to over-order. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory. Setting mu_hat to a more conservative level (reflecting the 135-141 range) ensures we satisfy demand while avoiding excessive holding costs as we move further into late spring/early summer. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility observed after the peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stability: Demand has shifted from a high-growth phase to a stable/slightly declining regime, averaging ~138 units over P9-P10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Kelly Shirt' (airy cotton blouse) showed a dramatic spring seasonal spike from February (P1-P3 avg ~52) peaking in late March/early April (P7-P8 avg ~187). Recent data (P9-P11) shows a stabilization/slight decline phase with demand values of 135, 141, and 184 respectively. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 153.3 units. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P7 arrival in P11). Currently, on-hand is 50 and in-transit is 561 (representing orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method as it has been consistent. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the post-peak demand level (~153/week), which for a 5-period horizon (L+1) results in 765 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the stabilized demand while accounting for the high volume currently in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand has transitioned from a rapid growth phase to a post-peak stability regime (April-end), averaging 153 units/week (P9-P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Kelly Shirt' (cotton blouse), which has experienced a significant seasonal climb from early February (20 units/week) to a peak in late April (205 units/week). Based on the calendar date (May 6), we are entering the post-peak stability phase or potential late-spring decline. Period 12 demand was 205 units, the highest recorded, but previous weeks (P9-P11) averaged approximately 153. A 4-week lookback (P9-P12) yields an average weekly demand of 166.25 units. Since we are near the end of the high season, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current plateau while avoiding over-ordering if demand begins to soften in May. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods across 8 concluded deliveries. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally maintain a high service level (~95% quantile). Setting L to calculate and using recent_N for demand parameters ensures we react to the most current seasonal volume without being anchored to the low early-year data.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at 205 units in late April (P12); the 4-week average (P9-P12) is ~166 units, confirming a high-plateau regime for cotton blouses in late spring.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is currently in a highndemand spring/summer regime. Following a peak of 205 units in late April (P12), demand in P13 was 164 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 166 units, which appears to be the current plateau for May. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 178 units and significant in-transit quantities arriving (154, 187, etc. in upcoming periods based on history), the strategy is to maintain a base stock level that supports this ~166 unit weekly average. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this most recent plateau phase (mid-April to mid-May), and sigma_hat using the same window to address the volatility seen during the transition from the peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for May confirmed: Average demand over P9-P13 is 166 units/week, following the April peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product is an airy cotton blouse, which is currently in its peak spring/early summer season. Demand analysis: Period 14 saw a significant spike to 232 units, the highest in the series, following a slight dip. This suggests demand is not declining as previously thought but is either plateauing at a high level or seeing a secondary surge as summer approaches. The last 4 periods (P11-P14) show demand of 184, 205, 164, and 232, averaging ~196 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P14 arrival). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 644 units, which covers approximately 3.3 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering late April through mid-May) to capture this high-plateau volatility and ensure the base stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts while demand remains strong.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-plateau/secondary peak phase for May (Period 14 demand: 232 units). The 4-week average (P11-P14) has increased to ~196 units/week, up from the ~166 average reported in P13-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20, 2019) shows strong late-spring demand (268 units), significantly higher than the previous month's average (~180). This suggests we are in a secondary peak or late-season surge for cotton blouses. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a period where sales were severely supply-constrained (sold 10 vs demand 268) due to a very small arrival (9 units ordered in P11). We have 874 units in-transit, with 198 units (ordered P12) expected to arrive during the current period (P16). To capture the current demand levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P12-P15), which averages ~217 units/week. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition and secondary peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed for late May: Period 15 demand grew to 268 units, pushing the 4-week average (P12-P15) to ~217 units/week compared to the P9-P13 average of ~166.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3762.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KELLY SHIRT (cotton blouse) continues to accelerate as we enter June, likely driven by early summer seasonality. The last four periods (P13-P16) show demand of 164, 232, 268, and 270, yielding a 4-week average of 233.5 units. The most recent two periods (P15-P16) suggest demand has stabilized around ~270 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in P16. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the P16 conclude message. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit during this high-demand period, I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-plateau/growth regime (averaging ~233.5 per week). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge for late May/early June confirmed: Demand has reached a new plateau of ~270 units/week (P15: 268, P16: 270), compared to the mid-May average of ~196.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (cotton shirt) is experiencing a high-demand late spring/early summer phase. Following a surge in late May/early June (P15-P16 demand: 268-270), demand in Period 17 was 195 units. This suggests the market is stabilizing around a high plateau or experiencing slight volatility near its peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 226 units/week. Given the current date (June 10th) and the high seasonality of 'airy cotton blouses' in early summer, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) to capture this high-plateau regime while being responsive to the recent peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-volume environment (1130 units across L+1), while sigma_hat using recent_N=5 accounts for the recent variance between the peak (270) and the recent dip (195).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the 'Kelly Shirt' (cotton blouse) appears to have stabilized following a late-May/early-June peak. Recent demand observations for Periods 17 and 18 were 195 and 180 units respectively, down from the 270 units seen in Period 16. This suggests the secondary peak has passed and we are entering a mid-summer stability phase. The 4-week average (P15-P18) is approximately 228 units, while the most recent 2-week average is 187.5 units. To avoid over-stocking as the season stabilizes, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the recent cooling while maintaining enough safety stock for potential late-season volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect current variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. On-hand is 62 and In-transit is 1057 (covering orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization confirmed: June (P17-P18) demand averaged 187.5 units, a ~30% decrease from the late-May peak of 270 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are managing a cotton shirt SKU. Demand analysis shows a post-peak stabilization regime in June following high volatility in May. The demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) was 195, 180, and 211, resulting in a 3-period average of 195.33 units/week. This represents a significant decrease from the late-May peak of ~270. On-hand inventory is 90 units with 1,015 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To avoid over-ordering during this post-peak phase while ensuring enough stock for current stabilization, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the June stabilization trend (avg ~195). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the naturally high volatility seen in this apparel category.

The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this cotton blouse peaked in late May (P16: 270) and has since trended downwards during June (P17-P20 demand: 195, 180, 211, 135). The most recent demand (P20: 135) suggests a significant softening as summer progresses. The average demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) is 180.25 units, but the last two periods average 173. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (245) and a substantial pipeline (916), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the most recent month of June, which captures the post-peak deceleration. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate a lower base stock and prevent excessive overstocking as demand potentially continues to cool in July.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak deceleration: June demand (P17-P20) averaged 180.25 units, compared to the May peak (P15-P16) of ~270. Early July starts with a lower demand point of 135, signaling a potential further decline into mid-summer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a post-peak summer decline phase. Demand has trended downwards from the late May peak (270 units) to the most recent value of 103 units in Period 21. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is approximately 149.6 units, but the most recent two periods (135 and 103) suggest a faster drop as the summer season progresses. On-hand inventory is high (457 units) due to arrivals from previous high-volume orders (P17 order of 315 arrived), and the pipeline remains significant (601 units). Given the high inventory levels (over 1000 units total) and the clear seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=3) to reflect the current lower demand regime, preventing excessive stock accumulation as the product enters the mid-summer low period. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 3 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed for July: Demand decreased from ~180 (June average) to 119 (P20-P21 average), likely reflecting the end of the peak spring/early-summer season for cotton blouses.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Airy Cotton Shirt (697564010) is clearly in a seasonal decline as we move into mid-July. The most recent demand samples (P20-P22: 135, 103, 84) show a significant downward trend from the May/June peak. The current on-hand inventory (586) plus in-transit stock (388) totaling 974 units is extremely high relative to the current demand rate of ~84 units/week. Given the seasonal nature of cotton blouses, demand is expected to continue cooling. My strategy is to stop ordering (the OR backend will naturally do this because pipeline exceeds base stock) and allow inventory to bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs. To reflect the new low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3), which captures the recent decline to ~107 units/week. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline trend for July accelerated: Period 20-22 demand dropped significantly (135, 103, 84), averaging ~107 units compared to the June average of ~180. The season for airy cotton blouses is transitioning into a low-demand phase.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a significant late-summer demand decline. Demand has dropped from a May peak of 270 units to 50 units in Period 23. The inventory position is currently very high (On-hand: 733 units) because historical high-volume orders placed during the May/June peak (Periods 17-19) are still arriving. Total in-transit is 191 units (the order from P20), which is more than enough to cover the forecasted 5-period demand (L+1) given the current trend (avg demand ~79 units/week over the last 3 periods, but declining). With 733 on hand and 191 arriving, the current stock covers nearly 12-15 weeks of demand at current rates. To avoid excessive holding costs during this off-season transition, I am setting parameters to cease ordering (0 units) by leaving L at default and using the most recent 3-period demand average (79 units/week) for mu_hat, which results in a base stock level significantly lower than current total inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline in July confirmed: P21-P23 demand (103, 84, 50) marks a clear exit from the spring/summer peak, averaging ~79 units/week compared to June average of ~180. Product shifting to off-season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) has confirmed a sharp seasonal decline as we move into late July. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~270 units in late May to just 43 units in Period 24. With on-hand inventory currently at 881 units and zero units in-transit, the existing stock already covers more than 20 weeks of current demand (881 / 43 \u2248 20.5), which is far beyond the 5-week window (L+1) required to maintain service levels. The 'in-transit' is zero because I set orders to 0 starting in Period 21 to mitigate overstocking during this downturn. I will continue to set orders to 0 by using a very low mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (average demand ~59) to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand inventory, effectively stopping new procurement while we bleed off the excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline in late July confirmed: P22-P24 demand (84, 50, 43) shows a rapid drop towards off-season levels, averaging ~59 units/week compared to early July average of ~119.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) has exited its spring/summer peak and is now in a clear off-season low-demand regime. Current demand has dropped significantly from the May peak (~270) and June average (~180) to a late July level of 34-43 units. The 3-week average (P23-P25) is 42.3 units. Inventory levels are very high (847 units on-hand) due to late-season orders arriving as demand fell. With 847 units on-hand and recent demand at ~40 units, we have over 20 weeks of supply. Therefore, the goal is to prevent any further ordering while demand continues its seasonal decline. For the OR parameters: L is set to 'default' (4) as lead time is stable. mu_hat is set to 42.3 * (1+4) \u2248 212, and sigma_hat is set using the recent_N method (N=3) to reflect the lower volatility of the current low-demand regime. The high on-hand inventory relative to mu_hat + safety stock will ensure the OR backend places zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season established: Period 23-25 demand (50, 43, 34) confirms a shift to a low-volume regime following the summer exit, averaging ~42 units/week (+/- 20% of late June levels).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) has definitively entered its off-season phase as of mid-August. Demand has plummeted from a late-May peak of 270 units/week to just 24 units in Period 26. The 4-week average (P23-P26) is approximately 38 units/week, reflecting a clear low-demand regime. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 823 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current demand rate of ~24-34 units, the existing stock covers over 20 weeks of demand, far exceeding the 5-week lead time + review cycle (L+1). With a holding cost of $1.00/unit/period vs $19.00 profit, the priority is to avoid further inventory accumulation while clearing existing stock. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this low-volume regime using the most recent 4 weeks to capture the stabilization at the floor, and keep L at the default promised 4 periods. No new orders will be generated by the OR backend as current inventory is well above the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season floor established: Period 24-26 demand (43, 34, 24) suggests a stabilization below 40 units/week, down from the June average of ~180.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) has firmly established its off-season regime as of mid-August. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~270 units/week in May to a stabilized floor below 30 units/week (P25-P27 demand: 34, 24, 22). The current on-hand inventory is 801 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 30 periods of supply. Given the significant holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the profit ($19.0/unit), the priority is to avoid any further ordering while liquidating the existing excess. Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods throughout the game. I will set parameters to ensure zero ordering by using the 'recent_N' method for the most recent low-demand regime (N=4, covering P24-P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than the 801 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season floor confirmed: August (P25-P27) demand has stabilized at ~26 units/week, down from the June average of ~180. The inventory position is currently in a significant surplus (>30 weeks of supply).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KELLY SHIRT (airy cotton blouse) has firmly established an off-season floor as summer concludes. Recent demand for Periods 26-28 (24, 22, 27) confirms a stable low-volume regime averaging approximately 24-25 units per week, which is a significant drop from the spring/summer peak. Current on-hand inventory is 774 units with 0 in-transit. At the current demand rate of ~25 units/week, the existing stock covers over 30 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=5 to capture this established low-demand baseline while maintaining the default lead time of 4 periods (which has been consistently confirmed in historical arrivals). The inventory strategy remains focused on depletion and minimizing holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (airy cotton blouse) has fully transitioned into the off-season/low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to its spring peak (~270), with an average of approximately 30 units/week over the last 5 periods (P25-P29). Current on-hand inventory is 735 units, which provides approximately 24 weeks of supply given the current demand rate. There are no units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) has transitioned from its peak spring/summer season into an off-season/low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (recent 4-week average [P27-P30]: ~34 units/week) compared to the May peak (~270 units/week). Despite a slight uptick in the last two weeks (39 and 48 units), the current on-hand inventory of 687 units is extremely high, representing approximately 15-20 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout in the off-season, no new orders should be placed. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current off-season floor of approximately 34 units/week, while keeping lead time (L) at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times remain stable. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory exceeds the base stock level calculated from these parameters and will correctly suppress further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season floor confirmed: August/September (P26-P30) demand shows stability at ~32 units/week (+/- 10). Current inventory levels are extremely high (>15 weeks supply), necessitating zero ordering until stock levels normalize.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt in airy cotton) is currently in its off-season phase. Historical demand for August and September (P25-P31) has established a low-volume floor, averaging approximately 29 units/week. Most recently, Period 31 demand dropped to 9 units, though historical volatility in this regime suggests a mean base stock around 30. The current on-hand inventory is 678 units, which covers approximately 23 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have no units in-transit, our current stock position is drastically higher than the optimal inventory level needed to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs. No orders have been placed since Period 20, and none should be placed until inventory levels fall significantly closer to the safety stock requirement. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a deep off-season phase as of late September. Historical demand peaked significantly in May/June (~270 units/week) but has since dropped and stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last three weeks (P30-P32), demand was 48, 9, and 11, averaging approximately 23 units/week. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 667 units, which represents roughly 30 weeks of supply at current demand rates. Given that the holding cost is $1.0/unit and demand is low, the priority remains to deplete existing stock rather than placing new orders. I will keep the base stock targets low using the recent_N method (N=7 to capture the late August/September stability) to ensure no new orders are triggered by the OR backend until the inventory levels normalize. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is currently in an extreme overstock position with 658 units on-hand and zero in-transit shipments. The current demand has stabilized at an 'off-season floor' following the spring/summer peak. The last three periods (P31-P33) show very low demand values of 9, 11, and 9 respectively, confirming the off-season regime. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and the high inventory level (representing over 60 weeks of supply at current demand rates), the objective is to prevent any further ordering until inventory levels are drastically reduced. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) captures the current low-demand stability (averaging ~17 units/week including the slight end-of-summer bump in P29-P30), which effectively ensures the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock = (1+L)*demand_mean + buffers) remains far below the existing on-hand plus pipeline inventory (658). This results in zero new orders being placed, which is necessary to minimize holding costs while the surplus is liquidated through sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Off-season floor confirmed with very low late-September demand (P31-P33 average: 9.6 units/week). Inventory remains in extreme surplus.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a deep off-season floor as of early October. Demand has dropped significantly from the spring/summer peak (~270 units/week) to an average of approximately 10 units/week over the last four periods (P31-P34: 9, 11, 9, 9). The current on-hand inventory is 649 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 60 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. The priority remains inventory depletion to minimize holding costs. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals through Period 24. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this stable, low-demand off-season regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt/Airy Cotton Blouse) is firmly in its off-season phase as of mid-October (Period 36). Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels, with the most recent sample (Period 35) showing 7 units and the 5-week average (P31-P35) being approximately 9 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 642 units, which represents over 70 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) relative to the inventory level, the primary objective remains to minimize holding costs while the surplus is gradually liquidated. No new orders are required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect this stabilized off-season floor (avg ~9), and the 'calculate' method for lead time as historical lead times have stayed consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor confirmed for October: Period 31-35 demand averages 8.6 units/week, down from the August/September average of ~32. Inventory remains in extreme surplus, sufficient to cover demand for the remainder of the year.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Kelly Shirt' is in a deep off-season period. Demand has stabilized at very low levels (average 8.4 units/week over the last 5 periods P32-P36). On-hand inventory is 636 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 75 weeks of sales. Given the game only has 10 periods remaining (ending at Period 47), the current inventory is far more than enough to satisfy all future demand until the end of the simulation. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will maintain lead time parameters at default as they are functioning as promised. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent extremely low off-season demand regime, which will result in a base stock level significantly below the current on-hand inventory, ensuring the capped policy outputs zero orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a deep off-season floor as of late October. Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels, averaging approximately 7 units per week over the last five periods (P33-P37). On-hand inventory is 630 units, which represents approximately 90 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There is no pipeline inventory. The objective remains focused on liquidating the existing surplus while avoiding any new holding costs. No orders will be placed (order will be 0 as long as base_stock is below on-hand inventory). Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor for October-end confirmed: P33-P37 demand has averaged 7.4 units/week, down from the September average of ~9.6. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (630 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an off-season floor phase (November 2019). The demand for the last six weeks (P33-P38) has been extremely low, averaging 7.16 units per week (9, 9, 7, 6, 6, 6). The current on-hand inventory of 624 units is exceptionally high, representing approximately 87 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There are no units in transit. Since the goal is to maximize profit minus holding costs, and the holding cost is $1.00 per unit per period, the priority is to liquidate the existing surplus rather than placing any new orders. The parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*7) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order, as the existing inventory far exceeds any reasonable safety stock level for the foreseeable future.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40). Demand for this 'airy cotton' blouse has reached its off-season floor, as expected for late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has been extremely low and stable, averaging 6.6 units per week (7, 6, 6, 6, 8). On-hand inventory is 616 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current average demand, the existing stock represents over 90 weeks of supply, which far exceeds the remaining 7 periods of the game. The priority remains to liquidate existing inventory and avoid any additional holding costs. I will continue to set parameters that result in zero new orders by using a very small N for mu_hat based on the most recent low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season floor for November remains stable at ~7 units/week (P35-P39 average: 6.6). This confirms a deep off-season trough for cotton blouses.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a deep off-season trough, typical for late November. Demand has been consistently very low for the past 10 periods, averaging approximately 7.5 units per week since Period 31 (P31-P40 demand: 9, 11, 9, 9, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8). Current on-hand inventory is 608 units with 0 in-transit. At the current demand rate (~8 units/week), the existing stock covers roughly 76 weeks of supply, far exceeding the remaining 7 periods of the game. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To maximize reward, I must continue to avoid ordering as the holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) significantly outbalances any potential profit from additional stock that would not be sold. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly calculates a base stock level far below my current on-hand + pipeline inventory, resulting in a 0 order.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the 'KELLY SHIRT' (airy cotton blouse) is in its deep off-season trough, with demand for the last five periods (P37-P41) averaging 6.8 units/week. Inventory is extremely high at 602 units on-hand, which covers approximately 88 weeks of demand at the current rate. The product objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs. Given the massive surplus and the short time remaining in the game (6 periods), the primary goal is to minimize further holding costs by not placing any new orders. The OR backend will produce an order of zero as long as the base stock calculation (derived from mu_hat and sigma_hat) remains significantly below the current inventory (on-hand + pipeline). I will use a recent_N window of 10 to capture the stable low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default as lead time is not a factor currently.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a deep off-season trough as of December 2nd. Historical demand has stabilized at an extremely low floor, averaging approximately 6.8 units per week over the last five periods (P38-P42). On-hand inventory is 596 units, which, at the current consumption rate, represents over 80 weeks of supply. No further orders are required for the remainder of the simulation (only 5 periods left). I am maintaining 'default' settings for lead time and using a very small 'recent_N' for demand to reflect this stable, low-volume floor while relying on the existing inventory surplus to meet all remaining demand without incurring further purchase costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a cotton blouse, currently in a deep off-season trough. Demand has been extremely low and stable for the past 13 periods (P31-P43), averaging approximately 7.5 units per week. Specifically, over the last 9 periods (P35-P43), demand has fluctuated strictly between 6 and 8 units. On-hand inventory is 588 units with zero in-transit. Given the current average demand of ~7 units, the existing stock is sufficient to cover approximately 84 weeks, far exceeding the remaining game periods (3 left). Therefore, I will continue to set parameters that result in zero ordering. I'll use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable Oct-Nov-Dec period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this floor, and default for lead time as there are no active shipments to track.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, an airy cotton blouse, is in a deep off-season trough. Demand has been extremely low and stable for several months, with the most recent 10-period average (P35-P44) at approximately 6.3 units per week. There is currently a massive inventory surplus of 586 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which at current demand rates covers more than 90 weeks\u2014well beyond the remaining periods of the game (47 total). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods whenever orders were placed. Given the massive overstock, the objective is to minimize holding costs by not placing any new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR backend remains far below the existing on-hand inventory, thus resulting in an order of 0 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). The product is a cotton blouse, which is currently in a deep off-season trough. Demand has been extremely low and stable, averaging ~5.8 units/week over the last five periods (P41-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 583 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents approximately 100 weeks of supply. This massive surplus was accumulated during the transition from the spring/summer peak. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the profit is $19.0/unit, the optimal policy is to carry zero in-transit inventory and allow the on-hand stock to deplete naturally. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the most recent 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed. No new sustained patterns are detected beyond the established off-season floor.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The SKU (airy cotton blouse) is in a deep off-season trough. Demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has averaged only 4 units/week (6, 8, 2, 3, 1), which is significantly lower than the November average (~7 units/week). On-hand inventory is 582 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, there is enough stock to last for over 100 periods. Therefore, the primary objective is to avoid any new orders and minimize further holding costs while the backend policy naturally depletes the massive surplus. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this ultra-low current demand regime, and L remains default as there are no in-transit orders to track.

Carry-over insight: Demand off-season floor for December-end: P42-P46 demand has averaged 4 units/week, down from the November average of ~7. Inventory remains in extreme surplus.
