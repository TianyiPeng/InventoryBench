Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Bob V-neck T-shirt. The historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 68.6 units (58, 59, 81, 84, 61), with a noticeable peak in late January. Since it's mid-February, we are moving past the initial early-year baseline but haven't hit major spring peaks yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given this is the first decision (on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0), I will use the recent 5 samples to establish mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability. Specifically, mu_hat should reflect the demand for the review period plus lead time (1 + 4 = 5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma will allow the backend to calculate the base-stock level based on the most relevant historical window while we await arrival confirmation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple women's V-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand from Jan 7 to Feb 11 has been: 58, 59, 81, 84, 61, 83. The average weekly demand is approximately 71 units with relatively high variance (std ~12). On Period 1, we ordered 90 units, which are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. Therefore, these units should arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Current on-hand is 0, so we are experiencing stockouts until the first delivery arrives. To set the parameters: 1) L remains at the promised default of 4 as we have no evidence to the contrary yet. 2) mu_hat is set to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand; I will use a conservative mean of 77 (recent_N=4 from the last 4 visible demand samples: 84, 61, 83 plus an estimate for the current unobserved period) to ensure the base stock is sufficient to halt stockouts once inventory arrives. 3) sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the volatility seen in the early Jan-Feb period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Our product is a Women's T-shirt, a staple garment. Reviewing demand history: the 5 historical samples average ~69 units, but the last two concluded periods saw a significant spike (83 and 136), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 188 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4, which means the P1 order (ordered 2019-02-11) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Since we have 0 on-hand and high recent demand, we need to ensure our base stock covers the lead time plus one review period (L+1=5). Because recent demand is much higher than the initial history, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the uptrend without over-relying on the lower January samples. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic item. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~68.6 units/week. However, current game demand (P1-P3) shows a significant jump: 83, 136, 103 (average 107.3), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Pipeline inventory is 345 units (orders from P1, P2, P3: 90+98+157=345). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order (lead time 4) is expected to arrive in Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the lead-time gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher activity and 'default' for sigma and lead time until physical arrivals confirm lead-time drift.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which typically has stable demand but can see early spring lifts. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~68.6 units. Since the game started in Feb, demand has been: P1=83, P2=136, P3=103, P4=70. The average demand over these 4 periods is 98 units/period, showing an increase from the pre-game samples. There is a critical stockout: On-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 (Lead time 4: 1+4=5) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message. Currently, we have 497 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Given the current demand volatility (std dev ~28 in game) and the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher in-game demand mean (~98) rather than the lower pre-game average. L is kept at default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 4 periods to reflect the more recent, higher-volume regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic everyday item. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the first order placed in Period 1 arrived exactly in Period 5 (L=4 confirmed). Demand history shows some volatility (58, 59, 81, 84, 61 initially; then 83, 136, 103, 70, 50 in the last 5 periods). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 88.4. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. On-hand is 40, and in-transit is 407 (orders from P2, P3, P4). The sum of inventory and pipeline (447) against a 5-period demand forecast (approx. 442) suggests we are well-positioned but should maintain a steady base stock. As it is mid-March, we expect a potential seasonal increase in T-shirt demand as spring progresses, but for now, we will use a recent demand window to capture the latest fluctuations while keeping L at the promised 4.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time matches promised lead time of 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Lead time observation confirms the promised 4 periods: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6. Demand for the last 6 periods averages 86.5 units/week, but we see two distinct phases: an initial high demand (Periods 1-3, avg ~107) followed by a cooling phase (Periods 4-6, avg ~65.6). This cooling coincides with the transition from late winter to early spring. However, looking at the historical pre-game data (Jan/Feb), demand was stable between 58-84. The current demand dip is likely stabilization rather than a trend downwards. With On-hand at 61 and In-transit at 309, we are well-covered for the lead time coverage period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the live game behavior which has been higher and more volatile than the pre-game history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to capture the live variance.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, a staple garment. Reviewing demand history: P1-P4 showed high demand (avg ~98), but P5-P6 saw a dip (50, 77), followed by an increase in P7 (110). Looking at the provided historical samples (Jan-Feb: 58-84), current demand is consistently higher, likely due to spring seasonality. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is healthy (215 units in-transit: Orders from P4, P7). On-hand inventory is 108. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Average demand over the last 7 periods is approx 90. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current active selling season's dynamics while smoothing out the minor dip in periods 5/6. Method 'calculate' for L is safe as the observed lead times match the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand shows variability but no clear sustained seasonal spike yet, though spring/summer usually drives T-shirt sales. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived exactly in P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory is 175 with 190 in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). Demand in the last few periods (P5-P8) has averaged 80.5 units, which is slightly down from the initial burst in Feb but relatively stable. Given the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use recent_N for both mean and sigma calculation to capture the post-initial-spike stability (last 5 periods). Lead time remains 'default' (4) as evidence confirms the promise.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a staple garment. Reviewing demand history: initial samples (58-84) were followed by a peak in early periods (P1-P3: 83, 136, 103) likely due to early spring interest, stabilizing to an average of ~76 units/period over the last 6 periods (P4-P9). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promise). In-transit inventory (217) consists of orders from P7 (63), P8 (127), and P9 (27). The lack of arrival in P9 is expected as the P5 order was 0 units. Given the transition into late spring, demand is expected to remain relatively stable. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stabilization. L is set to default as promised lead time is stable.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The item is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a staple basic with high seasonal potential in spring. Recent demand in Period 10 spiked to 156 units, causing a stockout (sold 113, ending on-hand 0). This spike matches the transition into late April/early May weather patterns. Historically, lead time is stable at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P4 arrived P8). Current in-transit inventory (266) includes orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. The P7 order (63 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of the current Period 11, but is not yet visible. Given the recent demand jump relative to the 2019 baseline (avg ~68 units) and the stockout, I need to capture the higher volume without over-ordering excessively as profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the quiet March period (avg ~75) to the current higher volatility April environment (P10 demand was 156).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in April; Period 10 demand (156) is 2.3x the start-of-year average (~68).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Transitioning from April to May typically sees increased demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts/Jersey basics) as the weather warms. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 10 (April 15th), with demand jumping from a Q1 average of ~68 to a recent average of ~107 (Periods 9-11: 62, 156, 105). However, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0 for Periods 10 and 11) because arrivals have been insufficient to meet this higher demand. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The in-transit pipeline (362 units) includes orders from Period 8 (127), 9 (27), 10 (49), and 11 (159). The Period 8 order (127 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 12. Given the stockout and the seasonal uptrend for basic tees, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the higher April demand levels (mean ~108, so mu_hat for L+1=5 periods will be ~540). Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility seen in Period 10 (156) and ensure a higher service level during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10 (mid-April): Average weekly demand increased from ~68 to ~108 (+58%) as the season transitions to Spring/Summer basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are in the peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts (Spring/Summer). Demand has fundamentally shifted since Period 10, increasing from a Q1 average of 68 to a recent average of 118.6 over the last three periods (P10: 156, P11: 105, P12: 95). The current on-hand inventory is low (32), and we have experienced stockouts in 2 of the last 3 periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures the higher seasonal mean (~118); while sigma_hat utilizes the higher volatility observed since the April shift. This setup ensures the base stock (covering 5 periods of demand) is elevated to match the seasonal trend and prevent further stockouts while waiting for in-transit orders to arrive.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, which is entering peak seasonality for Spring/Summer. Historically, demand shifted upwards starting Period 10 (mid-April), moving from an average of ~68 to ~112 over the last four periods (156, 105, 95, 90). The SKU is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, despite heavy in-transit stock (535 units). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P9 arrived P13). In Period 14, we expect the order from Period 10 (49 units) to arrive, which will likely result in another stock-out given the recent demand average. To stabilize availability for the current high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-April shift, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: May demand remains high (avg ~112 since Period 10) compared to early Q1 (avg ~68). Consistent stock-outs observed when on-hand inventory drops below 100 before resolution.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/20). The SKU 'Bob V-neck' is a Spring/Summer basic (fitted cotton jersey T-shirt), and demand has shifted significantly since mid-April (Period 10). The average demand since Period 10 is ~110.4 units, compared to ~68 units in the earlier part of the year. We are currently experiencing stock-outs because the on-hand inventory is insufficient (0 units) and the backend pipeline inventory is being depleted. In-transit inventory is high (509 units), reflecting large orders placed recently (P11-P14) to catch up with the regime shift. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have shifted into a higher-demand regime, I am choosing N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture specifically the post-shift behavior (Periods 10-14). This will set mu_hat at approximately (1+4) * 110.4 = 552, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current 100+ units/week demand levels while the pipeline catches up. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level is 0.5 (z=0), so mu_hat is the primary driver of the base stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, a summer essential. We are currently in late May (Period 16), which is peak season. Historical demand since Period 10 has established a new regime with an average of approximately 109 units per period (156, 105, 95, 90, 106, 102), significantly higher than the Q1 average of 68. Despite frequent stock-outs limiting our observation of true peak demand, recent weeks show sustained demand around 100-110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 57 and a pipeline of 393, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=6 for mu_hat (since the Period 10 shift) captures the current summer demand levels. For sigma_hat, using recent_N=6 captures the high volatility seen during this period (std dev ~22). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $1 profit/$1 holding cost balance while adjusting for the seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: May demand stable at ~104 units/period (P10-P15 average, though restricted by stock-outs). High season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts confirmed.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3rd), we are in the peak summer season for the 'Bob V-neck' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). Demand remains high and volatile. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the demand regime shifted in Period 10 (mid-April), the average weekly demand has increased significantly compared to Q1. The most recent demand (Period 16) was 128 units, and the average since Period 10 is approximately 111.7 units per period. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand summer regime (Periods 10-16). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this period, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent the recurring stock-outs seen in May.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: June demand continues the high regime established in mid-April; Period 10-16 average stands at ~112 units vs Q1 average of ~68.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Summer regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts, which stabilized in mid-April (Period 10). The average demand from Period 10 to Period 17 is approximately 110 units per week, significantly higher than the early Q1 average of ~68. Recent demand (P16: 128, P17: 94) reflects these levels, despite some historical stock-out constraints that likely masked true demand earlier in the season. Lead times have been consistently stable at the promised 4 periods (validated through P17). For Period 18, I will focus on the high-demand regime using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P10-P17) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1)=5 period lead time window at current summer consumption levels. The current on-hand inventory (162) and in-transit (303) are being monitored to prevent stock-outs while managing holding costs, which are equal to profit per unit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for women's V-neck t-shirts (Period 19, mid-June). Demand has significantly shifted since mid-April (Period 10). The average demand from Period 10 to Period 18 is approximately 105 units/period, despite some periods being supply-constrained. Recent demand shows a slight cooling from the extreme peaks (69 units in P18), but high volatility remains. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. With current on-hand inventory at 116 units and a substantial pipeline in-transit (363 units), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set L to 4 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 10 (avg ~105/week). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to account for the increased volatility observed during this high season, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient service level given the equal cost of profit and holding ($1.00).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which is in its high-demand summer season. History shows a clear regime shift around mid-April (Period 10). Since Period 10, the demand average has been approximately 107 units, whereas the pre-April average was ~68. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been 94, 69, 101, showing some volatility but remaining generally high. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods. With only 58 units on hand and 366 in transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19), we must maintain an aggressive base stock to account for the high summer demand and the 4-period lead time. I will use the recent regime (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) covers demand for the period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering July (Period 21), which is the peak summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck t-shirts. Demand has been elevated and stable since mid-April (Period 10). The average demand from Period 10 to Period 20 is approximately 113 units per period (calculated from visible demand data: 156, 105, 95, 90, 106, 102, 128, 94, 69, 101, 111). We observed a slight dip in demand in Period 18 (69 units), but it quickly recovered to 101 and 111 in the last two periods. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 42 units, and the pipeline is healthy at 370 units. To set OR parameters, I will use a N=11 regime length (representing the 'high season' starting at P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Historically, the standard deviation in this high-demand regime has been higher than earlier in the year, so N=11 will capture this increased volatility better than the full history.

Carry-over insight: July demand remains in the high-demand summer regime (avg ~113 units/period since Period 10). Demand volatility is higher than Q1 but remains manageable within the current pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '554772002' is a women's basic V-neck t-shirt, which entered a higher demand regime in mid-April (Period 10) that has remained consistent throughout the summer. Current date is July 8th, still within the peak summer season. Demand from Period 10 to Period 21 has averaged approximately 106 units per period, with volatility present but manageable. Looking at the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the average demand is 106.75. The lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain a service level consistent with this higher regime. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the historical stability of the 4-period lead time. Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=12 to focus specifically on the high-demand summer regime that started at Period 10. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the variance associated with this specific regime, ensuring the OR backend can properly calculate safety stock for the current environment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) remains in its peak summer season (July 15). Demand has stabilized at a high regime since mid-April (Period 10). From Period 10 to Period 22, the average demand is approximately 105 units per week, with recent weeks (P16-P22) showing a stable average of 101.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the entire summer regime starting from Period 10, ensuring the OR backend balances the current pipeline (377 units) and on-hand inventory (59 units) against this sustained demand level.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens V-neck T-shirt) is currently in its peak summer season (late July). Since Period 10 (mid-April), demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 105 units per week (periods 10-23). The most recent few periods (21-23) show demand levels of 114, 94, and 64 (average ~91); however, the overall summer average remains higher. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is relatively low (41), while the pipeline is 420 units, reflecting previous orders placed to meet the high summer demand. Given that we are now in late July, we must anticipate the high season to continue for at least another 4-5 weeks (the full lead time + review period window). I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat that captures the summer demand regime since the April shift (N=14) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this sustained high state without being overly reactive to a single lower data point in Period 23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period is 25 (Late July: 2019/07/29). Historical lead time calculation from 'Period 24 conclude' reinforces that actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). Demand analysis shows that the high summer regime (commencing P10, April) continues, but there is a slight deceleration in the last two weeks (P23: 64, P24: 79) compared to the June/early July average (approx. 110+). However, given that this SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck, demand is likely to remain relatively strong through the rest of the summer. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the full regime since the April shift (P10 to P24), which provides a stable mean of approximately 100 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=15 to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime without overreacting to the two most recent lower samples. The pipeline inventory (371) plus on-hand (61) equals 432, which is roughly 4.3 periods of coverage at the current mean, aligning well with the (L+1=5) target considering the upcoming transition toward late summer.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5). The product is a women's V-neck t-shirt. Demand analysis shows a high summer regime started around Period 10 (mid-April), maintaining an average of ~100-110 units until recently. However, the last three periods (P23-P25) have shown a noticeable decline in demand (64, 79, 54), with P25 being the lowest since the low-demand Q1 period. This suggests the summer peak is likely tapering off as we head into August. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture this downward trend (averaging ~81 units recently) while still accounting for recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is healthy (328 in-transit + 121 on-hand), and current stock covers the next few periods sufficiently, so parameters will focus on maintaining a safe but leaner buffer as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand began tapering in late July/early August (P23-P25); average dropped from ~110 to ~80 (-27%), suggesting the end of the summer peak season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019-08-12), the demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has clearly exited the summer peak. Following a stable high-demand regime from Period 10 to Period 22 (averaging ~110 units), demand has significantly tapered over the last four periods (P23-P26: 64, 79, 54, 78), averaging approximately 69 units. This drop aligns with a seasonal transition as late August approaches. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to adjust mu_hat to reflect this new lower-demand regime (N=4) to avoid excessive inventory accumulation (holding cost = profit) now that on-hand inventory is healthy (161 units). This reduction in mu_hat will signals the OR backend to lower the base stock level, effectively halting new orders until the current pipeline of 210 units is partially absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer transition (starting Period 23) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging ~69 units/period compared to the summer peak of ~110 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-necks has transitioned from a summer peak (avg ~112) back to a lower, more stable regime earlier than observed in mid-summer. Since Period 23 (mid-July), demand samples have been: 64, 79, 54, 78, 77. This average (~70 units/period) is consistent with Q1 demand (~68 units/period), confirming a return to baseline levels. On-hand inventory is high (173), and the pipeline (121) contains orders from Periods 24-27. Based on the 4-period lead time, Period 24's order (50) is expected to arrive in Period 28, and Period 25's order (71) in Period 29. With 173 on-hand and 121 in-transit, total coverage is 294 units. Against an expected demand of ~70/period, this covers over 4 periods of inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (the duration of the current post-summer regime) to reflect the lower demand and prevent over-stocking during this stabilization phase. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck) has transitioned out of its summer peak. In the last 6 periods (P23-P28), demand has averaged 76.5 units/period, down from the mid-summer average of ~112. The most recent demand (P28) was 107, but the overall trend since Period 23 supports a lower regime. I will set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak behavior while accounting for the recent uptick in Period 28. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand plus pipeline (116 + 129 = 245) exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (roughly 77 * 5 = 385? no, 77 * 5 = 385, so we are actually slightly under-stocked if demand stays at 77+ levels). Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods. 245 units covers ~49 units/period over 5 periods, which is lower than the current average. Therefore, higher parameters are needed to trigger an order.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the product is in a post-summer demand regime. Demand since Period 23 (mid-July) has averaged approximately 75 units/period (7.5-week window: P23=64, P24=79, P25=54, P26=78, P27=77, P28=107, P29=70). This is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~112 units but remains consistent with early-August observations. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand (117) plus in-transit (164) totals 281 units, which covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a safety buffer and account for the slightly higher demand observed in P28, I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the dynamics of the last 7 weeks which represent the stabilized post-peak regime while smoothing out the outlier of 107 in P28. The OR backend will use these values to manage the base stock policy effectively.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (starting Period 23) has stabilized at an average of ~75 units/period (Period 23-29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. This is a V-neck t-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which has transitioned from its summer peak (~112 units/period) to a stabilized post-summer regime. Demand since Period 23 has averaged approximately 72 units per period (samples: 64, 79, 54, 78, 77, 107, 70, 47). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime (Period 23-30), as it reflects the current autumn demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals. The OR backend needs to maintain a moderate base-stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1) while avoiding overstocking in a cooling market.

However, very recent demand (Periods 30-31) has fallen further to 47 and 30, suggesting a potential autumnal decline or just short-term variance. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is 40 and total in-transit is 290 (which includes orders from Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31), the pipeline is quite healthy relative to current sales. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the post-summer period from Period 23 to 31) to capture the stabilized lower demand level (~68 units/period) while ignoring the summer peak, and sigma_hat with recent_N=9 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P30-P31) shows a further decline below the 75 units/period post-summer average, potentially signaling a transition into a low-demand Autumn/Winter regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33 (late September). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck t-shirt has transitioned into a low-demand Autumn regime. Since Period 30, demand has dropped significantly, moving from a summer peak of ~110 and a post-summer average of ~75 down to an average of just ~34 units over the last three periods (P30: 47, P31: 30, P32: 26). The pipeline inventory is currently high (239 units in-transit), largely consisting of orders placed in P29 (106) and P30 (97) which are due to arrive in P33 and P34 respectively. These arrivals will satisfy current demand trends and lead to a significant inventory buildup if further large orders are placed. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend (averaging ~32.5/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect reduced volatility at lower volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to minimize further ordering while awaiting the arrival of the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed starting Period 30: Average weekly demand has dropped to ~34 units (P30-P32), a ~55% decrease from the previous post-summer average of ~75 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck) has transitioned into a lower-demand regime as of September (Period 30). Demand in the last four periods (P30-P33) has been 47, 30, 26, and 46, averaging approximately 37 units per period. This represents a significant drop from the post-summer average (~75) and the summer peak (~110). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 132 units, and there is a safe volume of 133 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, and P32). Given the 4-period lead time, the total pipeline inventory (265 units) is sufficient to cover about 7 periods of demand at the current rate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this Autumn low-demand regime, and keep lead time at default (4 periods) as arrivals remain consistent.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering October (Period 35), and the demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts has firmly transitioned into an Autumn/Winter low-demand regime. The carry-over insights indicate this shift started around Period 30. Looking at the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the actual demand values are 47, 30, 26, 46, and 29, yielding a recent average of approximately 35.6 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is high (200 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during the higher-demand transition period (P30). With in-transit stock also still arriving (36 units), and the demand significantly lower than previous months, my objective is to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this new low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: Period 30-34 average is ~36 units/period, a significant reduction from the Summer peak of ~112 and late Summer average of ~75.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck) has entered a stable low-demand Autumn/Winter regime since Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 35 is approximately 33.6 units, reflecting a major seasonal drop from the Summer peak (~112) and late Summer plateau (~75). The current on-hand inventory of 204 units is significantly high relative to this new demand level, especially considering the 1:1 Profit to Holding Cost ratio which favors lean inventory. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. Since current on-hand + in-transit (204 + 7 = 211) already covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate (211 / 33.6 \u2248 6.2 periods), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, from Period 30 onwards) to accurately capture this low-demand regime and minimize further holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed low-demand Autumn/Winter regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck. The demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 30, averaging approximately 30 units per period (P30-P36 average: 32). On-hand inventory is currently 189 units, which is approximately 6 periods of supply at the current demand rate and 0 units are in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory level, the OR backend will correctly suppress further orders as long as on-hand plus pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (P30-P36). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has definitively entered a low-season/Winter regime. Since Period 30 (early September), demand has steadily declined from ~47 units to 17 units. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is approximately 30 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P35-P37) averaging only 21 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 172 units with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover current demand levels for the next 5 periods (L+1) without additional ordering (expected demand for 5 periods ~105-150 units). To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the Autumn/Winter descent and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the lower volatility of this regime. The lead time L is set to calculate as it remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Winter low confirmed. Period 30-37 average demand is ~30 units, with a continuing downward trend as of late October (Period 37 demand was 17).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-necks has significantly tapered off as we move into November, confirming a low-demand late Autumn/Winter regime. Since Period 30, the average demand has been approximately 30 units per period, but recent samples (Periods 35-38) show an even lower current average of approximately 22.5 units. With 146 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels; even at the high-end estimate (30 units/period), the current inventory covers nearly 5 periods of demand. This eliminates the need for further ordering to minimize holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 9 periods (covering the regime shift since Period 30) to inform the OR backend of this sustained downward trend, while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed low-demand Autumn/Winter regime (starting Period 30). The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~112) down to an average of approximately 25 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P30-P39: 47, 30, 26, 46, 29, 25, 22, 17, 26, 7). The most recent demand (Period 39) was only 7 units. With 139 units on hand and a pipeline of only 3 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels (On-hand alone covers >5 weeks of demand at the regime average). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that reflect this low-demand state to prevent further unnecessary ordering while the OR backend burns through the excess inventory. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire lower regime while filtering out the high summer data.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime solidified: Period 30-39 average demand is ~25.5 units/period, with the most recent week showing a significant drop to 7 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeve V-neck t-shirt, which is entering its off-season in November. Demand has plummeted from a summer high of ~112 to a recent low (P30-P40 average) of ~24 units per period. The last two weeks saw demand of 7 and 13 units respectively. With 126 units on-hand and only 3 in-transit, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime. The strategy is to stop ordering (the backend will naturally stop if base stock < pipeline) and allow inventory to bleed down. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the established low-demand winter regime of ~19 units/period (P35-P40), which helps the OR backend set a lower target stock level reflecting the seasonal downturn.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime solidified: Period 35-40 average demand has dropped further to ~18.3 units/period, down from the early autumn (P30-P34) average of ~36.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (Period 42), deeply embedded in the Winter low-demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts. Demand has significantly decelerated from the Summer peak (~112) and even the early Autumn levels (~36). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) is approximately 18.6 units per period, with recent activity fluctuating between 7 and 26 units. On-hand inventory is currently 106 units, with 3 units in-transit (ordered P39). This inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately 5-6 weeks of current demand, which is well above the (L+1) window of 5 periods ( promised lead time 4 + 1). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. Large on-hand inventory relative to the low demand means the OR backend will likely order 0 units to reduce holding costs. To align the backend's base-stock calculation with the current regime, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized low-demand period, and default for L as arrivals have been consistent with the 4-period promise.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554772002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) is currently in a sustained low-demand winter regime. Recent demand values for the last 5 periods are 7, 13, 20, 33, and the carry-over insight notes an average of ~18.3 units/period (P35-P40). Period 42 showed a slight uptick to 33, but this is still well within the winter volatility range and does not yet signal a regime shift. With on-hand inventory at 73 and basically no meaningful in-transit units (3), we are holding enough stock to cover over 3 periods of the current average demand. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), and we are approaching the end of the game (Period 43 of 47), maintaining a lean inventory is critical to avoid R_t depletion from holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture only the winter regime (approx P35-P42) and keep L at the default promised lead time of 4, as lead times have been consistent.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in a confirmed low-demand Winter regime. Since Period 35, demand has consistently registered in the low double digits, recently averaging 18.5 units over the last 9 periods (P35-P43). Although there was a slight uptick to 33 units in Period 42, Period 43 returned to a very low value (8). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck t-shirt (Jersey Basic), which is highly seasonal towards warmer months and experiences minimal demand during deep Winter. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the low demand and the high on-hand inventory (68 units) relative to recent demand, and with 26 units in-transit (reaching a total pipeline of 94 units against expected demand of ~18/week), the primary objective is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a small safety buffer for possible Minor holiday-related fluctuations. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since early October.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-current) stable at ~18.5 units/period; significant reduction from autumn levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck) is currently in a stable low-demand Winter regime. Demand since Period 35 has averaged approximately 18.5 units per period. The most recent demand samples (P42-P44) are 33, 8, and 10, showing some minor volatility but no clear upward trend. On-hand inventory is 58 units, with 27 units in-transit (P43 order of 26 and P44 order of 1). Cumulative demand over the lead time (L=4) plus current period is expected to be approximately 92.5 units ((1+4)*18.5). My total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 85 units, which is slightly below the expected demand for the horizon. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 47), avoid overstocking to minimize holding costs, but ensure enough coverage for the remaining 3 periods. I am setting mu_hat using N=10 to capture the recent winter stability while allowing for the slight volatility seen in Period 42.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday season. Historically, demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey top has been in a sustained low-demand winter regime since Period 35. The average demand from Period 35 to Period 45 is approximately 16.5 units per period. Recent samples (P43-P45) show demand of 8, 10, and 14, suggesting a slight upward crawl potentially due to holiday shopping, but it remains far below summer peaks. On-hand inventory is 44 and in-transit is 33 (Total pipeline: 77). With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using the recent mean of ~17 units per period, 5 periods of demand equals ~85 units. Our inventory is slightly below this, so a small order is justified. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the winter regime) for mean and volatility to reflect the current low-demand stability while allowing for the recent slight variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 47 (December 30, 2019). We are in the final stages of the winter low-demand regime for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). Demand has been consistently low since Period 35, with recent demand (P43-P46) averaging 11.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 30 units, and there are 45 units in transit (expected to begin arriving from orders placed in P43-P46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, requiring tight inventory control to avoid excessive holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the stable winter demand regime (approx 17.5 units/period) and sigma_hat using the same period to account for recent low volatility.
