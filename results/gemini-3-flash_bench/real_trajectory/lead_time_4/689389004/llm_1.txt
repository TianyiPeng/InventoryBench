Blouses/shirts often see stable demand during this period, though post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and early spring transitions can cause variations. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows 60, 56, 82, 71, and 107. There is a trending increase, with the average being ~75 units/period, but the most recent period spiked to 107. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With L=4, I need enough stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: 0 on-hand, 0 in-transit. Pipeline is empty. (e) Order Logic: Projected demand for 5 periods based on the most recent average/trend (approx 85-90 units avg) is ~450 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are zero, I must place a large initial order to fill the pipeline. I will order 450 units to establish coverage for the lead time duration.",

To ensure I don't run into a stockout immediately after the first shipment arrives and to account for the current upward trend (avg 80-90), I need to maintain a pipeline.

This aligns with the transition from winter to spring fashion, where blouses see higher velocity. The promised lead time is 4 periods.

The last two periods saw demand of 57 and 81 units, which aligns with the observed mean of roughly 75 units for late February/March.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a long-sleeve viscose blouse, which is currently in its winter seasonal low. Demand over the last five periods (P40-P44) has been very consistent and suppressed, averaging 12.2 units per week (9, 12, 13, 17, 10). We are currently at Period 45 with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). My current on-hand inventory is 292 units, which is drastically more than the expected total demand for the remaining periods (approx. 36-40 units total). The holding cost is $1.0 per unit per period, which equals the profit per unit. Therefore, any excess inventory held until the end of the simulation will negate the profit earned from sales. Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) would arrive in Period 49, which is past the end of the simulation (P47). There is no reason to order more stock; the priority is to liquidate existing on-hand inventory to minimize total holding costs.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a long-sleeved viscose blouse. Current demand is in a deep winter trough, averaging approximately 12 units per week over the last seven periods (P39-P45). Historical data shows that demand previously peaked in early spring (Feb/Mar) and again in autumn (Sep). As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are approaching the end of the year and the likely start of the early spring demand cycle observed in Period 1 (late Feb). Current on-hand inventory is 278 units. At a demand rate of ~12 units/week, this inventory covers approximately 23 weeks, which comfortably extends into the spring season. Given the $1.00 holding cost and the high current stock level, no additional orders are required to meet demand through the winter and the beginning of the next spring peak. Ordering now would only increase holding costs unnecessarily.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The simulation is currently at Period 47, which is the final period of the game (Date: 2019/12/30). In the final period, the objective is to maximize total reward, which includes subtracting HoldingCost based on ending inventory. Since there are no more periods of demand to satisfy after this decision, any units remaining in inventory will only contribute to costs without providing further profit. The current on-hand inventory is 261 units, while the recent winter demand regime for this viscose blouse (DENISE SHIRT S.0) has been consistently low, averaging approximately 14 units per week over the last five periods (P42-P46: 13, 17, 10, 14, 17). Even if Period 47 sees a slight spike due to Year-End/New Year sales, the existing 261 units are more than sufficient to cover it. Ordering more would only increase the ending inventory and the associated holding cost ($1.0/unit), thereby reducing the total reward. Therefore, the optimal action for the final period is to place no order.",
