Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Pyjama bottoms in lightweight fabric', which is a stable staple item in womens nightwear, though it might see slight demand fluctuations around seasonal transitions. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [47, 63, 69, 60, 61], showing an average of 60.0 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 8.12. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. My objective is to ensure that the order placed (plus existing pipeline/on-hand) covers the period of risk, which is (L+1) = 5 periods. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, the OR backend needs to place an initial order. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current stable demand regime while ignoring potential older noise if any. Setting L to default (4) as we have no historical lead time departures yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Womens Nightwear Pyjama bottoms'. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a stable mean of approximately 60 (47, 63, 69, 60, 61). Period 1 demand was lower at 41, but since starting on-hand was 0, zero units were sold. The order of 74 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently in a stockout situation. To calculate parameters: \u03bc\u0302 should reflect the average demand over the (L+1) window. Average demand across all 6 samples is (47+63+69+60+61+41)/6 = 56.8. With L=4, \u03bc\u0302 = 5 * 56.8 = 284. Standard deviation of samples is 10.15, so \u03c3\u0302 = sqrt(5) * 10.15 \u2248 22.7. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent demand data and 'default' for L and sigma_hat.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). Current demand for this Womens Nightwear item (Pyjama bottoms) averages ~56 units/week based on the 5 pre-game samples (47, 63, 69, 60, 61) and recent game demand (41, 50). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because orders placed in Period 1 and 2 are in-transit (Promised Lead Time = 4). Total in-transit is 149 units. We expect first arrivals in Period 5 (P1+L). Forecast: The mean demand of all 7 samples is 55.8. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods, approximately 279 units. Since there is no shift evidence yet, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while waiting for stock to arrive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Women's Pyjama bottoms. Historically, demand has been stable: 47, 63, 69, 60, 61 (pre-game) and 41, 50, 62 (Period 1-3). The average demand is approximately 56 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (74 units), P2 (75 units), and P3 (73 units) are all in-transit. Based on the rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (P1+L=5) and should be visible at the start of P6. Consequently, on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead time buffer. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 222 units, which covers roughly 4 weeks of demand. To maintain a steady supply, I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand average (~56) multiplied by (1+L). With L=4, mu_hat should be around 280. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 (covering both pre-game samples and in-game samples) to capture the stable demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The SKU '536139010' is a women's pyjama bottom. Historical demand (including the provided seed data) is relatively stable, ranging from 41 to 69 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game started in Period 1, the first order ever placed (Period 1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (1 + 4 = 5). According to the 'Period Execution Sequence', this arrival occurs AFTER my decision for Period 5. Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' is seen in all 'conclude' messages so far. I have 0 on-hand inventory and 295 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 74+75+73+73). Demand has been steady: mean ~60. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while respecting the 5 available samples. Lead time is set to 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Pyjama bottoms'. Initial demand samples (5 weeks) showed a mean of ~60. Observations from Periods 1-5 show demand values: 41, 50, 62, 60, 53 (mean: 53.2). Period 1's order arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand is 21 units with 221 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since the lead time is confirmed as 4, and demand is relatively stable around the historical mean, I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to capture the slightly lower recent demand (avg 53 vs historical avg 60) while maintaining the promised lead time L=4. N=5 is chosen to cover all observed demand periods in the game history which reflect the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5); Demand regime stable with mean ~53 units/week (Periods 1-5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Pyjama bottoms', which often sees stable demand outside of major holidays. Historical demand (Periods 1-6) shows a mean of ~50 units (41, 50, 62, 60, 53, 33). Note: the most recent sample (33) is lower, but we need more data to confirm a downward shift. Promised lead time is 4, and arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2) confirm the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. On-hand is 63, and pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 186. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a base-stock target covering (L+1) periods. Since the lead time is stable at 4, L=default (4) is appropriate. For mu_hat, considering all samples is statistically sound given the small sample size, so default is used. For sigma_hat, the variability (std dev ~11) suggests a standard buffer, so default is used.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom. Historical demand shows a slight decrease as we move into spring, with recent weekly demands of 33, 43, and 53 (average ~43), compared to the earlier average of ~53 (Periods 1-5). Analyzing lead times: Orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods. The Period 4 order (73 units) is expected to arrive in Period 8's arrival phase (visible in Period 9's start). Current on-hand is 93 and in-transit is 157 (Orders from P4, P6, P7). Total pipeline (93 + 157 = 250) is sufficient to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (~43 * 5 = 215). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the softening spring demand and stick with the calculated lead time which matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift observed: Mean decreased from ~53 (P1-P5) to ~43 (P6-P7) as spring progresses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is women's pyjama bottoms, which typically sees a seasonal decline as we move further into spring. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand analysis: The initial regime (P1-P5) averaged ~53, while the more recent regime (P6-P8) has averaged ~41.7. Period 8 saw a slight uptick to 49, but overall demand is trending lower than the early February peak. On-hand inventory is healthy at 117 units. Considering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand coverage and a current on-hand/in-transit balance, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the spring slowdown while acknowledging the recent P8 demand. L=4 remains the observed lead time. High holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4) suggests we should avoid overstocking during this slow season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean decreased from 53 (P1-P5) to ~42 (P6-P8) as spring seasonality impacts the nightwear category.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing a nightwear SKU (pyjama bottoms). The historical demand showed a higher mean of ~53 in the early weeks (winter/early spring) but has shifted to a lower regime as spring progresses into mid-April. The last four demand samples are 33, 43, 49, and 43, averaging approximately 42 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (as seen in arrivals for P1, P2, P3, and P4). No order was placed in P5 or P8, but there are 122 units currently in-transit (from orders in P6, P7, and P9). On-hand inventory is 74. Since demand has stabilized at a lower level for at least 4 periods (P6-P9), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current spring demand regime. L is set to default (4 periods). This will help the backend compute a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand while preventing overstocking as demand cools down.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10). Demand has shifted from a mean of ~53 units/week (P1-P5) to ~42 units/week (P6-P10). This decrease aligns with the seasonality of 'Alex Trs (J) Nightwear' (lightweight pyjama bottoms), which might see reduced demand or stabilizing low demand as spring progresses into warmer weather. In-transit inventory is 109 (orders from P7: 44, P9: 38, P10: 27). The P7 order (44 units) is expected to arrive during this current Period 11 and be visible in the P11 conclusion message. Current on-hand is 72. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the more recent stable demand regime of ~42 units/week. Lead time is set to default (promised 4) as it aligns with observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~42 units/week (Periods 6-10) following the early spring decline from 53.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'lightweight' pyjama bottom, which is seasonally relevant for the transition into late spring and summer. Current demand has stabilized at ~42 units/week (Periods 6-11 mean is 41.5). The lead time is confirmed as a consistent 4 periods (P6 order arrived P10, P7 arrived P11). Period 5 order is missing/lost (ordered 0, arrived 0 in P9; likely a non-event, but P8 arrival was the last P4 order). Current on-hand is 77, and in-transit is 105 (Orders from P9, P10, P11). Pipeline is 182 units. For Period 12, I will set mu_hat based on the stable recent regime (N=6, covering P6-P11) which reflects the lower spring demand compared to February. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture the current lower volatility. L remains calculated as 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is 'Pyjama bottoms in lightweight fabric', which fits the mid-spring/early summer season. Demand has settled into a stable regime since Period 6, averaging approximately 41.5 units per week (periods 6-12 demand: 33, 43, 49, 43, 42, 39, 46). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this most recent stable regime. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. While P12 did not have an arrival, this is expected as no order was placed in P8. No orders are currently overdue (P9 order is expected in P13, P10 in P14, etc.). Inventory (On-hand: 31, In-transit: 141) is relatively healthy against a forecast of ~208 units for the L+1 window, but a small top-up might be triggered by the OR backend to maintain safety stock as on-hand is low.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'lightweight' pyjama bottom, fitting for the current late spring season (May 13). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 42 units/week over the last 8 periods (P6-P13), showing significantly lower variance compared to the initial winter/early spring weeks. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals in P10, P11, and P13. Currently, there is an arrival gap (nothing arrived in P12 due to the P8 order being zero), leading to a lower on-hand inventory of 29. However, the in-transit pipeline (152 units) is substantial relative to the (L+1) demand coverage required (approx. 5 * 42 = 210 units). Given the profit/holding ratio of 4:1, the target service level is 80%. I will use recent trends (last 8 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the stabilized lower demand regime and reduced volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15 (2019/05/20). The item is lightweight pyjama bottoms, which should remain stable in late spring/early summer. Demand in Period 14 spiked to 69 (stockout occurred, selling only 56), which is higher than the previous average of ~42. Historical data from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) showed similar levels (60-69). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 163 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 14's arrival of the Period 10 order). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P10-P14) to capture the recent spike while maintaining some stability. Based on (1+L) = 5 periods, and average demand P10-P14 being ~47.2, mu_hat will target roughly 236. Given the stockout in P14, it is crucial to ensure base stock covers the lead time pipeline adequately.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in mid-May: Period 14 demand spiked to 69 from a previous floor of ~42, resulting in a stockout.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is lightweight pajama bottoms (womens nightwear). We are currently at Period 16 (May 27). After a stable low-demand period (approx. 42 units/week), demand has surged in mid-to-late May (69 in P14, 55 in P15), likely due to seasonal behavior as temperatures rise or promotional activity. This has led to two consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (191 units) consists of orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15. The promised and actual lead time remains 4 periods. Since we have experienced a demand jump, I will set mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend (last 3 periods average: ~57) rather than the long-term stable average. For mu_hat, using recent_N=5 captures the shift from 40s to 50s/60s. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 accounts for the recent high volatility observed in P14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-May: Mean increased from ~42 (P6-P13) to ~57 (P14-P15), indicating late-spring seasonal growth for lightweight nightwear.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 starts with zero on-hand inventory and an ongoing stockout (36 units available vs. 45 units demand in Period 16). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 14, likely due to late-spring seasonality for 'lightweight fabric' nightwear. Mean demand from Period 14-16 is 56.3 units, compared to the previous ~42. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher-volume regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock (covering Period 17 and the 4-period lead time) to recover from the current stockout and improve service level during this seasonal uptick.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) context: The item is women's lightweight pyjama bottoms. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a demand shift occurred in mid-May (Period 14-15), where demand increased from a floor of ~42 to ~57 units per week due to late-spring seasonality. However, the last two periods (P16: 45, P17: 38) show a slight cooldown, bringing the average of the last 4 periods (P14-P17) to 51.75. On-hand inventory is critically low (11 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. Pipeline inventory is high (254 units), with orders from P14 (38), P15 (68), P16 (71), and P17 (77) expected to arrive in P18, P19, P20, and P21 respectively. To maintain service levels during this seasonal window while accounting for the recent slight softening of demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent average (~52) across the lead-time horizon (L+1=5). This ensures we satisfy the seasonal demand without over-ordering as we enter mid-June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, we are in a mid-summer demand phase for 'lightweight fabric' pyjama bottoms. Historical demand from Periods 14-18 averaged 48.6 units/week (69, 55, 45, 38, 36). While there was a significant spike in mid-May leading to stockouts, the last three periods (38, 36, and current week) show a softening in demand, likely settling into a summer rhythm. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (13), but in-transit (pipeline) is high (236) due to large orders placed in Periods 15-17 to recover from previous stockouts. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand average (~49) across the lead time + review period (5 weeks total), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers approximately 245 units (5 weeks * 49) minus the 236 in-transit, preventing significant over-ordering while maintaining availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from a mid-May spike (peak 69) to a stable summer regime; Periods 16-18 mean is ~40 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). The product is lightweight pyjama bottoms, which are entering a stable summer demand phase. Reviewing recent data: Period 16 (45), Period 17 (38), Period 18 (36), and Period 19 (33). The average demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 38 units. The 'summer regime' insight from Period 19 specified a mean of ~40. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in multiple conclude messages, including the most recent one). Pipeline inventory is currently 188 units (orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19 arriving in P20, P21, P22, and P23 respectively). With on-hand inventory at 48 units and a stable demand around 35-40, the system is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current downward trend towards the 33-38 unit range, and use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Mean has stabilized at ~38 units/week (Periods 16-19) from late June onwards.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The product is lightweight pyjama bottoms, which are naturally in season, but demand data shows a stabilization or slight cooling after the mid-May volatility. Period 20 demand was notably low (20 units), confirming the summer regime identified in previous periods. The 'summer demand' mean for Periods 16-20 is approximately 34.4 units/week (45, 38, 36, 33, 20). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (99) and pipeline inventory is high (117) due to large orders placed during the mid-May stockout period. To avoid overstocking while maintaining coverage for the steady summer demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 34.4 mean adjusted for (1+L=5) periods. Sigma_hat is also calculated using N=5 to reflect current lower volatility compared to the May spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (late June/July) shows a lower mean than May; Periods 16-20 mean is ~34 units/week (down from peak 69).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-81.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, mid-summer. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P17 arrived at start of P22). Demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop since the mid-May peak. The demand for 'lightweight Pyjama bottoms' has trended downward from ~57 in mid-May to a mean of ~27 over the last 6 periods (P16-P21: 45, 38, 36, 33, 20, 19). The most recent two periods (20 and 19) suggest a new lower floor as summer heat peaks, potentially reducing demand for even lightweight long bottoms. Inventory is currently high (157 units on-hand) due to large orders placed during the May spike finally arriving. With low current demand (~20 units/week), this on-hand stock covers over 7 weeks of supply, already exceeding the (L+1) coverage requirement. Therefore, I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the declining trend in mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will likely order 0 units given the surplus inventory, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline confirmed (P16-P21): Mean dropped from ~57 in May to ~27 units/week in late June/July (-52%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the mid-summer demand regime for women's lightweight pyjama bottoms. Historical data and the last 7 periods (P16-P22) show a significant and sustained decline in demand compared to the spring peak. The mean demand for the last seven periods is approximately 29.7 units/week, with the most recent four weeks (P19-P22) averaging even lower at ~24.75 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high (150 units), covering approximately 5-6 weeks of demand at current rates, while 20 units are still in transit (ordered P19). Since on-hand inventory + in-transit (170) is significantly higher than the expected base stock level (approx (4+1)*25 = 125 plus safety stock), the OR backend will likely order zero, which is appropriate given the holding costs relative to profit and the current overstock situation. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this mid-summer low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high spring volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) further stabilized at a lower mean: P19-P22 demand averaged 24.75 units/week, confirming the seasonal decline for lightweight pyjama bottoms during core summer months.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (2019/07/22). The current inventory position is very high (On-hand: 128) relative to recent demand trends. For the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has averaged 28.2 units/week (33, 20, 19, 27, 42). While there was a slight uptick to 42 in Period 23, the overall summer regime for lightweight pyjama bottoms remains significantly lower than the May peak. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. With 128 units on hand and a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 132 units, we cover approximately 4.7 weeks of the recent average demand (28.2). Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. The current inventory is almost exactly at the level needed for the current regime. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the stable summer demand while acknowledging the slight recent volatility, and default for others to allow the OR engine to stabilize. No large order is expected given the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (late July) stabilized: P19-P23 mean demand is 28.2 units/week, down from May peaks of ~57.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (late July). The product 'lightweight pyjama bottoms' has entered a stable low-demand summer phase. History shows a clear decline from May peaks (~57 units/week) to a summer regime. For Periods 19-24, the demand samples are [33, 20, 19, 27, 42, 20], giving a mean of 26.83 units/week. While Period 23 saw a minor spike to 42, the overall trend is suppressed. Current on-hand inventory is 108 units with 39 in-transit (total 147 units). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1=5 periods). With a projected mean of ~27, we need approximately 135 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline (147) already covers this. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this summer regime (Period 19-24). Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at its promised value of 4, consistent with delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Summer stable demand regime (late June - July) confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 19-24 is 26.8 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in a stable late-summer demand regime for lightweight pyjama bottoms. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), demand has averaged 26.7 units per week, significantly lower than the May peak (~57 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 82 units and in-transit at 44 units (total pipeline 126), and expected demand for the (L+1) window (5 periods) totaling approximately 134 units, current stocks are nearly sufficient. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the core summer stability (P19-P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a buffer that reflects recent low-consumption patterns and avoid excessive holding costs as we transition towards late August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '536139010' (lightweight pyjama bottoms) currently sits in a stable late-summer demand regime. Observation of the last 8 periods (P19-P26) shows weekly demand consistently averaging ~26.5 units (range 19-42, with most values between 20-33). As we are now in mid-August (2019-08-12), we anticipate this low-demand summer baseline to continue before potential autumn shifts. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by multiple completed cycles). On-hand inventory (57) plus in-transit (68) totals 125 units, which covers approximately 4.7 weeks of the current mean demand. This is slightly above the target coverage of (L+1) = 5 weeks, but within a safe range given the volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable summer regime, and keep L at default (promised 4) as it aligns with observed history.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (late June - August) remains stable: Mean demand for Periods 19-26 is 26.5 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are entering late August/early September, which typically marks a transition period in retail from summer to autumn/back-to-school. Period 27 demand spiked to 59 units, significantly higher than the summer average of ~26.5 units, suggesting the start of an autumn demand recovery for lightweight pyjama bottoms as customers prepare for slightly cooler nights. Looking at the start of the year (Periods 1-5), demand was in the 40-63 range (mean ~53). I will anticipate this recovery by shifting the demand forecast upward. I will use recent_N=9 (Periods 19-27) for mu_hat but explicitly adjust for the upward trend signal in Period 27. On-hand is critically low at 2 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 87, which is sufficient for a mean of 17-20 units/week, but with the spike to 59, we need to ensure the base stock covers a higher mean to avoid stockouts during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 27 (59 units), signaling the end of the mid-summer low (avg ~26.5) and the start of a late-August/early-Autumn recovery regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for lightweight pyjama bottoms is showing a clear seasonal recovery as we transition from summer to autumn (late August). Period 27 (demand: 59) and Period 28 (demand: 53) indicate a shift from the summer average of ~26.5 to a new higher regime. Combined with the initial game samples (Feb demand ~59), I expect demand to stabilize around 55-60 units per week. Currently, we are stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 109 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals in Period 29 (from P25), Period 30 (from P26), Period 31 (from P27), and Period 32 (from P28). I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this recovery (56 units/period * 5 periods = 280) and increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility during this transition. This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover the seasonal upturn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime confirmed (Late August): Demand increased from ~26.5 to ~56 units/week (Periods 27-28), matching early February levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019). The data confirms a seasonal transition from the summer low (~26 units/week) to an autumn recovery. Demand in P27 was 59, P28 was 53, and P29 was 30 (despite stockouts in P28-P29 limiting sales). Since we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and demand is rising for the autumn season, we must set parameters to capture the higher mean. Recent samples show demand is stabilizing around 45-55 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent spike (P26-P29 mean is ~42 including the stockout-limited P29), while lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P27-P29) of the new regime is safer to ensure we don't under-order during this recovery. I will use explicit for mu_hat at (1+L)*47 and sigma_hat at sqrt(1+L)*15 to account for the increased volatility during seasonal shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime (Late August) continues: Demand is shifting from summer lows (~26) toward early-year levels (~50). Stockouts in P28-P29 (sales capped at 37 and 5) hide true demand, which is estimated around 45-55 units based on P27-P28 evidence.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) confirms the Autumn recovery regime is in full effect. Recent demand (P27-P30) shows a significant spike from summer lows (~26) to an average of ~50.25 units/week, despite stockouts in P28-P30 capping sales. I estimate current weekly demand at 55 units to account for lost sales and the upward trajectory seen in P27 (59) and P30 (59). The on-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit (234 units) covers approximately 4.25 weeks of demand. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline inventory (L+1) should cover 5 weeks of demand. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to satisfy this higher demand regime and recover from the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 275 (55 units/week * 5 weeks). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility associated with this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime (September) confirmed: Mean demand has shifted from summer lows (~26) to ~55 units/week, mirroring early-year levels. Persistent stockouts in P28-P30 confirm demand exceeds recently observed sales.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-September (Period 32). The product (pyjama bottoms) is entering the Autumn recovery phase. Historical demand in this regime (from Period 27-31) shows a significant increase from summer lows of ~26 back to ~55-60 units/week. Periods 28-31 have experienced total stockouts (on-hand is 0), meaning actual demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units. Recent demand samples (P27: 59, P28: 53, P30: 59, P31: 63) suggest a stable mean around 58. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My objective is to aggressively rebuild inventory to capture this higher demand and avoid further lost sales. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this Autumn regime shift, which covers the period from P27 to P31, and using an explicit lead time of 4 to ensure the OR engine calculations are precise.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime (September) confirmed: Demand has returned to early-year levels with a mean of ~58 units/week (Periods 27-31). Severe stockouts in P28-P31 indicate demand consistently exceeds supply.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn demand regime (late September). Recent demand analysis (Periods 27-32) shows a significant recovery from summer lows (~26) back to early-year levels, with observed demand samples being [59, 53, 30, 59, 63, 66]. However, sales have been severely restricted by stockouts in Periods 28-32. Based on Period 27 (full fulfillment at 59) and Period 32 (57 units sold out when demand was 66), the true demand mean is estimated at approximately 60 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains stable and confirmed by recent arrivals (P23-P28 orders arrived with L=4). To recover from the current stockout (on-hand = 0) and meet the Autumn regime, I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to an explicit value of 300 (covering 5 periods: L+1 at 60 units/week), and sigma_hat to an explicit value of 35 to account for the supply-side volatility and stockout recovery needs. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the pipeline during the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime (September) confirmed: True demand estimated at ~60 units/week (P27-P32). Periodic stockouts since P28 have capped sales below actual demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for lightweight pyjama bottoms has entered a strong Autumn recovery/Peak phase as of late September. Period 33 demand spiked to 113 units, significantly higher than the previous Autumn recovery estimate of ~60. This aligns with seasonal shifts in nightwear as customers transition away from mid-summer lows. Frequent stockouts since Period 28 (including P33) indicate that historical 'sales' significantly underrepresent true 'demand'. I am shifting \u03bc\u0302 to an explicit value based on a (1+L) * 90-unit forecast to account for the current demand momentum and provide safety buffer, as the previous ceiling of 60 was breached. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand remains at 0 with high in-transit volumes intended to catch up to this late-summer/autumn pivot.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 113 units, exceeding the previous recovery estimate of ~60. The regime has shifted from 'recovery' to 'peak' (avg ~90+ units/week).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Alex Trs (J)' lightweight pyjama bottoms has entered a strong Autumn/Winter peak phase. Average demand over the last two periods (P33-P34) is 90 units, a significant jump from the earlier 'recovery' level of ~60. Although sales in P34 were 67, the previous period demand of 113 clearly indicates we are in a higher-demand regime as the weather cools. Pipeline inventory is currently 299 units, including large orders from P31-P34 (67, 11, 86, 135) scheduled to arrive shortly. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to 450 (90 units/week * (1+L)) to reflect this sustained peak regime and ensure the OR backend aims for a service level that prevents further lost sales during this crucial seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand confirmed: Late September/Early October demand is averaging ~90 units/week (P33-P34), up 50% from the September recovery mean of ~60.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for lightweight pyjama bottoms is currently in its peak Autumn/Winter regime. Period 33 saw a massive spike to 113, followed by 67 and 71 in Periods 34 and 35, despite the product being a 'lightweight fabric'. Historically, early-year demand was ~53; the 'recovery' was ~60; the current 'peak' is averaging approximately 84 units/week ((113+67+71)/3). With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (1 unit) and 359 units in-transit, we need to maintain high parameters to capture this seasonal volume. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the 84 units/week average (P33-P35) which covers the immediate peak. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility seen in P33 (stdev of 113, 67, 71).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Late September to mid-October demand is averaging ~84 units/week (P33-P35), significantly higher than the early Autumn recovery level of ~60.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October (Period 37), a peak demand period for nightwear. Demand in the current regime (Periods 33-36) has been significantly higher than previous periods, with observed values of 113, 67, 71, and 69. Note that Period 36 sales were limited by stockouts (sold 12, on-hand 0), and actual demand was 69. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (Autumn/Winter peak) is 80 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high demand surge, we need to ensure the pipeline (455 units) plus any new orders covers the (L+1) window of 5 periods. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this peak regime (400 total over 5 periods), while recent_N=4 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility (std \u2248 22, so sigma_hat \u2248 44 for 5 periods). This approach ensures we maintain high service levels during the peak season while the OR engine manages the existing large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak regime (late September - October) mean demand confirmed at ~80 units/week (Periods 33-36), characterized by high volatility and frequent stockouts.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-October Autumn/Winter peak regime. Period 37 demand was 70 units, consistent with the recently established 'peak' mean of approximately 80 units/week (Periods 33-37: 113, 67, 71, 69, 70). Although individual sales fluctuate, the shift from the September recovery (~60) to this higher level is sustained. Stockouts were common until Period 37 when an arrival of 86 units left us with 16 on-hand. The current Pipeline (In-transit: 369) + On-hand (16) = 385 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~80, required inventory is roughly 400 plus safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this peak regime (Mean ~78), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the high volatility (std ~18). Setting L to default (4 periods) as arrivals have been consistently conforming to the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak regime (late September - October) mean stabilized at ~78 units/week (Periods 33-37: 113, 67, 71, 69, 70), significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~26.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for lightweight pyjama bottoms is currently in its Autumn/Winter peak regime, which started around Period 33. While the mean demand for the extended peak period (P33-P38) is approximately 75 units, the most recent four periods (P35-P38) show a very stable cluster with demands of 71, 69, 70, and 62 (average 68). I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on this stabilized peak window (N=6). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P28-P34 orders arriving 4 periods later). On-hand inventory (89) and healthy pipeline inventory (276) provide better coverage than previous periods. Setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the high-demand volatility of the current regime while moving past the initial outlier spike of 113. This helps the OR backend maintain a high service level for the peak season while preventing excessive overstocking as we enter November.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand has stabilized around a mean of ~68 units/week (Periods 35-38) following the initial September surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-November. Demand has cooled from the October peak (approx. 80 units/week) to an average of ~48 units/week over the last two periods (P38: 62, P39: 35), though we must note P39 was a significant drop. We have 181 units on-hand and 196 in-transit (orders from P36, P38, P39), totaling a pipeline of 377 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, this inventory position covers approximately 7.8 weeks of demand at the current 48 unit/week rate. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P35-P39) captures the deceleration from the peak to the current late-autumn levels while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. L remains calculated as 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak has passed its maximum; demand is decelerating from ~80 units/week (Sept/Oct) to ~48 units/week in early November (P38-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for lightweight pyjama bottoms is showing a clear seasonal deceleration as we move deeper into November. After the autumn peak (which reached ~80 units in October), demand has dropped to 35 and 60 units in the last two periods (P39-P40), averaging 47.5 units. Given the transition towards late autumn/winter, demand for this 'lightweight' SKU is expected to stabilize or continue to soften. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 228), which is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ weeks of demand at the current rate. With 89 units still in-transit and a steady 4-period lead time, the priority is to draw down inventory to avoid high holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a service level for the current regime (~48 units/week). L is kept at 'default' (4) as actual lead times are consistently 4. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent deceleration from the peak, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the volatility seen during the transition out of the peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime deceleration confirmed in mid-November: Mean demand has decreased from ~78 (P33-P37) to ~48 units/week (P38-P40) as the autumn peak concludes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November). The Autumn/Winter demand peak has clearly passed. Demand in recent weeks has trended towards a lower mean: P38-P41 demand values are 62, 35, 60, and 52, averaging 52.25 units/week. This supports the carry-over insight from P41 which detected a deceleration from the ~80 unit/week peak down to ~48-52. Current on-hand inventory is 176 units, with 89 units in-transit (total pipeline = 265). With a lead time of 4, the target window is 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent mean of ~52, 5 periods of demand equals ~260 units. Since our current inventory and scheduled arrivals (265) already cover this estimated requirement, and we want to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit) during a period of declining seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent deceleration and sigma_hat to account for recent variability. The OR backend will likely minimize additional ordering to bleed off the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime deceleration confirmed (late Nov): Mean demand has shifted from the ~80 unit peak to approx 52 units/week (Periods 38-41).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (175 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). This significantly depleted on-hand inventory from 176 to 43. The current date is December 2nd, entering the core December holiday shopping season for nightwear. Given the recent spike follows a period of deceleration (approx. 50 units/week), and knowing the category (Pyjama bottoms), we expect demand to remain elevated but likely lower than the extreme Black Friday peak. The last 5 periods of demand (62, 35, 60, 52, 175) average 76.8 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility and the seasonal shift towards December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (67 units) plus on-hand (43 units) is 110. A mu_hat based on N=5 will target around 384 units (76.8 * 5), which will trigger a significant restock order to prepare for the Christmas peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 175 units (likely Black Friday). Demand regime has shifted from November deceleration (~52) to high-volatility December peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 536139010 (lightweight pyjama bottoms) is currently experiencing a high-demand holiday regime. Period 42 saw a massive spike (175 units, likely Black Friday), and Period 43 demand remained extremely high (132 units), resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). We are currently in early December (Period 44), which is typically a peak period for nightwear. Pipeline inventory (189) is composed of orders from Period 42 (20 units, due P46) and Period 43 (169 units, due P47). Given the recent stockout and the observed mean of ~153.5 over the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that covers approximately 150 units/week over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), adjusted for the fact that we have significant volume already in transit. However, because on-hand is 0, the OR backend needs to maintain high mu_hat to trigger necessary replenishment if the current pipeline isn't sufficient for the high volatility (sigma_hat). I will use explicit values to reflect the shift from the ~52 unit November level to the ~150 unit December level.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~52 (Nov) to ~153 units/week (P42-P43), a ~195% increase, leading to immediate stockouts.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (175 units, Black Friday), and demand has remained high at 132 and 131 units in Periods 43 and 44, respectively. This confirms the 'Holiday demand regime' noted in carry-over insights, with demand approximately triple the November levels (~146 mean for P42-P44 vs ~52 mean for P38-P41). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a total of 420 units in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand and sigma to capture this dramatic December shift, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected high demand for the remainder of the year while the in-transit orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~52 (Nov) to ~146 units/week (P42-P44), a ~180% increase, resulting in consistent stockouts since P43.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the December holiday peak (Period 46, Dec 23). The demand regime for December (Periods 42-45) has averaged ~127.5 units/week (175, 132, 131, 72), though recent stockouts in P43-P45 have likely suppressed observed sales data. The demand in P45 (72) suggests the sharpest peak may be subsiding as Christmas approaches, but historical patterns from the start of the year (P1-P5 avg ~53) suggest demand will remain significantly higher than summer lows (~26). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a massive pipeline of 608 units is in transit. Specifically, the order from P42 (20 units) is expected to arrive in P46, and the large order from P43 (169 units) is expected in P47. Given the game ends at Period 47, my priority is to satisfy remaining holiday demand while avoiding excessive leftover inventory that incurs holding costs. I will use a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the high December mean (covering P42-P45) while ensuring sigma_hat reflects the extreme volatility observed during this holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) mean confirmed at ~127 units/week (P42-P45), significantly higher than the November deceleration phase (~52), but beginning to taper off in late December (P45 demand 72).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, right after the Christmas peak for nightwear. Demand in Period 46 (53 units) confirms a significant drop from the holiday peak (avg ~130 in P42-P44). Historical data from Period 1 (starting Feb 11, avg ~53) suggests that demand typically stabilizes around 50-60 units after the new year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 698 units in-transit (reflecting massive orders placed during the December stockout), the pipeline is heavily overstocked relative to expected Jan/Feb demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-holiday baseline (around 55 units/week) using recent_N=1 to capture the most recent drop, even though the OR backend's cap will likely prevent further ordering until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak has concluded: Period 46 demand (53 units) aligns with the pre-surge baseline (~52 units in Nov), ending the Dec peak (~127 units/week).
