Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 728162002, a basic women's V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks has shown a declining trend since early January (36 units) to early February (16 units), averaging approximately 19 units per week. Given it is a 'Jersey Basic', demand is likely stable but currently in a low period post-holiday. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. I will use the recent 5-period average (approx 19.2) to calculate mu_hat. I'll use the default calculation for L (4) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock for this basic item while avoiding excessive holding costs given the $1/unit holding cost matches the $1/unit profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but can see early spring uplifts. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 46 units, while the historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged 19 units. This suggests the recent demand is significantly higher than the initial historical data. Because on-hand inventory was 0 and our first order of 37 units is still in transit (promised lead time is 4 periods, so it should arrive in Period 5), we are currently experiencing stockouts. To adapt to this higher demand level, I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (including the high Period 1 value) to capture the upward trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility. The lead time L is kept at default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised value.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic everyday item. Promised lead time is 4. Historical samples (Jan-early Feb) showed demand between 10-36. However, observed demand in P1 (46) and P2 (73) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to the transition into Spring (late Feb). The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 93 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=4, we don't expect arrivals until P5/P6. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=2 to capture this recent spike, as the older Jan data is no longer representative of the current spring trend. Setting L to 'default' as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand increased from a Jan avg of ~19 to ~60 (+215%), signaling spring seasonality for basic jersey tops.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is seeing a significant demand surge as we approach spring. The demand samples since Period 1 (46, 73, 73) confirm a regime shift from the January average of ~19 (samples: 36, 21, 10, 12, 16). The mean of the last 3 periods is 64. Promised lead time (L) is 4. This means orders placed in Period 1 (Feb 11) will arrive in Period 5 (Mar 11). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 184 units in the pipeline (37+56+91). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher spring demand regime, and stick to the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until arrival data proves otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's basic jersey V-neck T-shirt, which is showing clear upward seasonality as spring approaches. Historical demand has jumped significantly from the January average of ~19 (samples: 36, 21, 10, 12, 16) to a February/March average of ~84 (Period 1-4: 46, 73, 73, 142). The most recent period saw a massive spike to 142. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 274 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first order (37 units) is physically expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (Arrival Resolution phase) according to the promised lead time (1+4=5). It will not be visible until the Period 5 conclude message. Because the current demand regime (last 4 periods) is drastically different from the pre-game samples, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this spring surge. I will maintain the default lead time (4) as we have not yet concluded any periods where arrivals were expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~19 in Jan to ~84 in Feb/Mar (+342%), with a significant spike to 142 in early March, indicating strong spring seasonality for Jersey Basics.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (March 18). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand has surged significantly due to spring seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics', increasing from a Jan average of ~19 to a recent average of ~114 (avg of Feb/Mar samples). In P5, demand hit 234 units, while we only had 37 units on-hand, leading to 197 lost sales. Our on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 381 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods, we expect the P2 order (56 units) to arrive during P6. I will set L=4 (default) and use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 2-5: 73, 73, 142, 234) while moving past the low Jan volumes. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4)*mean(recent 4) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4)*std(recent 4) by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated in March: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is 150 units, compared to the Feb average of ~60, confirming peak spring seasonality for Jersey Basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a massive spring demand surge. Observed demand in Period 6 spiked to 311, significantly higher than previous periods (P5: 234, P4: 142). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order in P6). With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current 'In-transit' of 581 units, we are significantly under-stocked relative to this new demand regime. To avoid ongoing stockouts, I need the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this hyper-growth. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging the latest demand values of 142, 234, 311) which results in a mean of 229 per period. Multiplied by (L+1)=5, this targets a base stock around 1,145 units. Using N=3 for sigma_hat captures the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated significantly in late March (P5-P6): Mean demand for the last 2 periods is 272 units, nearly double the early March average, reflecting peak seasonal demand for Jersey Basics.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) is currently in its peak spring season (April 1st). Demand has surged from approximately 19-20 in January to an average of 265 units over the last three periods (P5-P7: 234, 311, 250). Despite arrivals beginning to flow in (Lead Time confirmed at exactly 4 periods), the high demand has kept on-hand inventory at zero, leading to significant stockouts. We currently have 859 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7), which are expected to arrive in P8, P9, P10, and P11 respectively. To capture the full demand potential and reach a healthy stock level during this peak, I am setting mu_hat to 1325 (5 periods * 265 average demand) using the recent_N method with N=3 to reflect the current high-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high level for the last 3 periods (P5-P7), averaging 265 units/period, confirming a sustained peak seasonal level for Jersey Basics in late March/early April.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Jersey Basic' V-neck T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring season. Historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding demand, the last period (P8) saw a significant drop to 94 units compared to the previous plateau of ~265 units (P5-P7). This could be a post-peak correction or a one-off fluctuation. However, given it's early April, it's safer to incorporate the recent slowdown while maintaining enough stock for potential spring spikes. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (averaging P5-P8: 234, 311, 250, 94; mean \u2248 222) to balance the recent high peak with the latest drop. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this period transition. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory but 1101 units in-transit (ordered P5-P8), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level considering this pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early April: Period 8 demand dropped to 94 units after a three-period plateau averaging 265 units, suggesting a potential end to the peak spring surge or significant weekly variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (April 15), we are entering mid-spring. The SKU ('728162002', V-neck Jersey T-shirt) has exhibited extreme demand volatility recently: transitioning from a high-peak plateau (avg ~265 in P5-P7) to a sharp dip (94 in P8) and then a recovery to 187 in Period 9. The last 4 periods average 210 units. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 968 units. The backend's base-stock calculation for this SKU (with a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio) targets a 50% service level; however, the capped policy ensures we cover average demand plus safety stock for (L+1) periods. Given the volatility and the product type (women's everyday basics in spring), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current post-peak regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance observed in April.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: following a late March peak (avg 265), demand fluctuated (94 in P8, 187 in P9), establishing a new April average of ~140 units, significantly lower than the March peak but still higher than the Feb baseline.

Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/pre-summer season. Demand has stabilized after the late March peak (avg 265); the last three periods (P8-P10) show demand of 94, 187, and 203, establishing a late-spring average around 161 units. Period 10 was the first period since the surge began where we successfully satisfied all demand (sold 203) and ended with 53 units on hand, thanks to the arrival of the 256-unit order from Period 6. Observed lead time is consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10). High in-transit inventory (797 units) reflects large orders placed during the March peak (P7: 369, P8: 332). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the current post-peak stabilization level (~161/period). The OR backend uses a (1+L) logic, so for L=4, it will forecast demand for 5 periods. Pipeline inventory (797) + On-hand (53) is 850, while expected demand over (L+1) = 5 * 161 = 805, meaning the system is well-stocked but needs to maintain the replenishment flow as the large March orders arrive and clear.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in April (P8-P10) at an average of 161 units/period, down from the late-March peak of 265 but still significantly higher than the Feb baseline of ~60.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 11 periods into the game. We are moving from peak spring into May. The demand history shows a massive peak in late March (Period 6 demand = 311, Period 7 = 250), which has since cooled to an April average (P8-P11) of 147 units per period. The most recent demand (P11) was 104, suggesting a return to a more stable, non-peak baseline. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 7 completed arrivals. Inventory is currently healthy: On-hand is 318 and In-transit is 428. These 428 units in-transit correspond to orders from P8 (332 units), P9 (11 units), and P10 (85 units), which are expected to arrive in P12, P13, and P14 respectively. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the base stock to align with the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current post-peak April average (~147) and use the same window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering as seasonality potentially fades into early summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (P8-P11) has stabilized at an average of 147 units/period, down from the March peak average of ~265, but still significantly higher than the February baseline of ~60.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are in the late spring season for this 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt.' Analysis of recent demand indicates a significant cooling from the mid-March peak (avg ~265). Over the last five periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged 139.2 units, with the most recent two weeks showing consistency at 104 and 108 units. The current on-hand inventory is 542 units, and we have 96 units in-transit (expected in P13 from the P9 order), totaling 638 units of pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (approx 140/week), the required base stock is roughly 700 units. Our current inventory position (638) is close to this, and we already face high holding costs due to the large on-hand balance. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand level, while keeping L at the calculated average (which has consistently been 4 periods) to avoid over-ordering while clearing current stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (P8-P12) has stabilized at an average of 139 units/period, showing a clear descent from the March peak and entering a steady late-spring state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-431.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical data shows that demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt peaked in March (approx. 265 units/period) and has been steadily declining through April and May. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) has dropped to 91 units, and the most recent demand (P13) was 61 units. This confirms a post-peak stabilization or further decline as we move towards late spring/summer. The current on-hand inventory is 492 units, which is extremely high (covering over 5 weeks of demand at current rates). The in-transit inventory is 143 units (from P10 and P13 orders), which will further increase stock levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given that the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to hold approximately (L+1) periods of median demand. Since current stock (492) already far exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (estimated at ~450 units based on recent trends), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent deceleration and avoid over-ordering, while keeping L at the promised 4 to maintain standard logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand entered a clear descent phase in May, with P11-P13 averaging 91 units/period, down significantly from the April average of ~140 and the March peak of ~265.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-429.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20th. Analysis of demand history shows a clear seasonal decline from the peak observed in March. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) have seen demands of 108, 61, and 74 units, averaging 81 units per period. This represents a significant regime shift compared to the April average (~140) and March peak (~265). Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods for all 10 concluded shipments. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 503, in-transit: 58) compared to the projected demand for the review and lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods). With an average demand of ~80, the required base stock is roughly 400-500 units, meaning our existing inventory already covers or exceeds needs. I'm using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized 'May/Late Spring' demand level to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the item transitions out of its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in May: Mean demand for P12-P14 is 81 units/period, confirming a descent from the April level of ~140 and a return toward pre-peak levels of ~60-80 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt has stabilized in a 'post-peak' descent phase throughout May. The average demand for the last four periods (P12-P15) is 78 units, compared to the peak March average of 265 units and the April average of 140 units. We currently have 434 units on-hand and 58 units in-transit (due to arrive in P17 from order P13). Actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (~5.5 weeks of supply), and equal profit vs. holding cost ($1.0), the goal is to avoid overstocking while demand continues to cool into late spring. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent stabilized May average (~80 units/period) for the (L+1) horizon (5 units * 80 = 400). Using recent_N=4 for sigma_hat captures the current lower volatility of the descent phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Mean demand for P12-P15 is 78 units/period, confirming the end of the spring peak and established settling at pre-peak levels (~70-80).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) has exited its spring peak (March/April) and stabilized in a late-spring/early-summer demand regime. For Period 17 (June 3), the demand over the last four periods (P13-P16) was 61, 74, 69, and 49, averaging approximately 63 units/period. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that demand has settled back to pre-peak levels (~60-80 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on all confirmed arrivals. Currently, there is significant on-hand inventory (385 units) resulting from large orders placed during the March peak that arrived as demand was already cooling. Given the high current inventory relative to the low stabilized demand (385 units vs ~63 demand), and a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0/unit), the primary objective is to avoid further excess inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this lower stabilized demand and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility of this new regime. This should result in zero or minimal new orders until the current surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late spring/early summer (June): Mean demand for P13-P16 is 63 units/period, down from the April average of ~140 and May average of ~80, returning to a consistent pre-peak baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a women's v-neck t-shirt, which experienced a significant spring peak in March/April and has since settled into a lower, stable early-summer demand regime. In Period 17, demand was 120 units, slightly higher than the recent average but likely a fluctuation rather than a new regime shift given the seasonal context. The average demand for the last five periods (P13-P17) is 74.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 323 units with no in-transit orders, as recent ordering has been zero due to the large inventory surplus accumulated after the peak. This surplus is gradually depleting. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the post-peak stability for both mean demand and volatility. Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the service level target (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will likely be very near the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1). L=4 and N=5 for demand and sigma calculations will allow the system to respond appropriately as the stock levels normalize.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) showed a significant demand surge in June (P17: 120, P18: 173), following a stable May where demand averaged around 65-80. This uptick likely reflects summer seasonality for basic cotton jersey tops. Current on-hand inventory is 150 units, which covers less than one period of the most recent demand. The pipeline contains only 50 units (ordered P18, expected P22), resulting in a low inventory position relative to the current demand level. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Given the sharp increase in the last two periods (mean = 146.5), I will adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend. Using a recent_N of 3 captures the transition from late May to the June surge. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to reflect higher volatility seen during these shifts. This ensures we raise the base stock level to prevent lost sales durante the summer peak while acknowledging the lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in June (Period 17-18): Mean demand increased to 146 units/period from a May baseline of ~70, signaling a summer seasonal peak for Jersey Basics.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Women's Jersey V-neck T-shirt) is experiencing a summertime demand surge in late June. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has risen from 120 to 217, with a mean of 170 units/period. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in P19 (leading to lost sales), and 'in-transit' inventory stands at 267 units (orders from P18 and P19). Since the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P17 all arrived at L=4), I will maintain L at 4. To capture the current summer peak and restore stock quickly, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to isolate the June surge (Avg ~170), and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover 5 periods of elevated summer demand while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: Mean demand for P17-P19 is 170 units/period, compared to the May baseline of ~70, representing a ~143% increase following the spring descent.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Women's Jersey V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a summer seasonal peak (July 1st). Demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) has been 173, 217, and 159, averaging approximately 183 units/period. This is a significant increase from the May/June baseline (~70 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 517 units in-transit. Based on the history, lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P18 (50 units), P19 (217 units), and P20 (250 units) are expected to arrive in P22, P23, and P24 respectively. Period 21 has no incoming arrivals. To maintain service levels during this summer peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime (~183 per period). This results in a forecasted demand over (L+1) periods of approximately 915 units. Given that total pipeline plus on-hand is ~517, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge this gap.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak stabilized in July: Mean demand for P18-P20 is 183 units/period, confirming a sustained high-demand regime (~160% increase over the May baseline).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for Jersey Basics (July/early summer). The mean demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) is 181.75 units (173, 217, 159, 178). Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a substantial pipeline of 750 units. Orders from P18 (50 units), P19 (217 units), P20 (250 units), and P21 (233 units) are expected to arrive in P22, P23, P24, and P25 respectively, as lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The current pipeline of 750 units effectively covers approximately 4.1 periods of the current average demand (~181/period). To maintain the target service level in the 'Jersey Basic' category, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the stable summer high and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed stable in July: Mean demand for P18-P21 is 182 units/period, maintaining a high-demand regime consistently above 150 units since early June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt'. The last four periods (P19-P22) show consistent demand between 159 and 217 units, averaging 182 units/period. The actual lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P18 order arriving in P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant pipeline of 859 units coming from orders in P19 (217), P20 (250), P21 (233), and P22 (159). For the Period 23 decision, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the sustained summer demand shift, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the previous May/June low-demand baseline. With profit ($1) equal to holding cost ($1), the backend's target service level will be q = 0.5 (z*=0), roughly targeting the mean demand. The parameters should allow the OR engine to maintain this buffer as long as the summer peak persists.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P19-P23) shows a sustained summer peak with an average of 186.2 units/period (217, 159, 178, 174, 203). This confirms the high-demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. Current on-hand inventory is very low (14 units) following the P23 arrival and demand resolution. The pipeline inventory is 684 units, which includes large orders from P20 (250), P21 (233), P22 (159), and P23 (42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals from P18 and P19. To ensure availability while managing high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (the current summer regime) and use default settings for lead time and volatility, as the pipeline is already substantial and should cover the next few periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed stable in July: Mean demand for P19-P23 is 186 units/period, maintaining a high-demand regime consistent with late June/early July levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the midst of a summer demand peak for Women's Everyday Basics (Jersey V-neck T-shirt). Demand in the most recent period (P24) spiked significantly to 273 units, the highest observed in this summer regime. Since Period 19, demand has consistently remained high, though showing significant volatility (ranging from 159 to 273). The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 201 units. Period 24 concluded with zero on-hand inventory despite an arrival of 250 units, indicating we are under-stocked relative to current momentum. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated summer baseline and the increased volatility observed in the latest period, ensuring the base stock level targets this higher mean (approx 200/period) over the replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge reached a new peak in late July (P24): Demand hit 273 units, increasing the 6-period mean to ~201 units/period, compared to the early summer average of ~170.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). We are in a summer demand regime for this 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt', which typically sees high demand through late July and early August. After a massive demand spike in Period 24 (273 units), Period 25 dropped to 127 units. Evaluating the recent 'summer peak' from Period 19 to 25, the demand mean is approximately 190 units/period. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. With only 106 units on hand and 703 in transit, and given that service levels should be balanced where profit = $1 and holding cost = $1 (target quantile q = 0.5), I will use the recent 7 periods (the start of the summer surge) to set the forecast. This timeframe captures the volatility and the mean of the current season while avoiding the much lower May/June baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak (P19-P25) mean is established at ~190 units/period, despite a drop to 127 in P25 following the P24 spike of 273.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late summer phase for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops. Historically, we saw a massive demand surge in late July (P24 demand: 273), which has since cooled to a more stable level (P25: 127, P26: 107). This suggests the summer peak is likely concluding, shifting toward a late-summer/early-autumn baseline. The 5-period mean (P22-P26) is approximately 163 units. Given the recent trend of decreasing demand (127 -> 107), I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this deceleration while respecting the overall summer volume. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P22, P23, P24, P25, and P26). I have 158 units on hand and 686 units in the pipeline (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26). The pipeline is robust, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering naturally, but using a recent_N=5 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we don't over-order based on the July spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak is subsiding in August: Mean demand for P25-P26 dropped to 117 units/period from the late July peak of 273, suggesting a seasonal transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' V-neck T-shirts is showing a clear seasonal decline as August progresses. After a strong summer peak (P19-P24 mean ~200), the last three periods (P25-P27) have seen demand drop to 127, 107, and 46 units respectively. The average for these last three periods is ~93 units, and the most recent observation (46) suggests the drop is accelerating toward pre-summer levels (approx 60-80). With on-hand inventory at 154 and a massive pipeline of 684 units (dating from the high-order period in July), we are significantly over-inventoried for the current demand regime. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs during this descent, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the immediate downward trend while allowing the OR backend to use the substantial pipeline to satisfy demand, likely resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: August demand is declining sharply from the July summer peak (avg ~200). Mean demand for P25-P27 is ~93 units/period, with the most recent sample at 46, indicating a return to late-spring baseline levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' is clearly exiting its summer peak. In August (P25-P28), demand samples were 127, 107, 46, and 69. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that demand is returning to a baseline level seen in late spring (around 60-80 units). The current on-hand inventory is 318 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand regime. Additionally, in-transit inventory is 451 units, with arrivals expected over the next four periods from orders placed in P25 (269), P26 (142), P27 (40), and P28 (0). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 769) and the declining demand (mean ~80), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend (N=4) to prevent further overstocking and excessive holding costs while the backend drains the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in August: Mean demand for P25-P28 is 87 units/period, confirming the end of the summer peak (avg ~190) and a return to the underlying jersey basic baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt is in a clear seasonal descent as we enter September. Historically, demand peaked in July (averaging ~190 units/period) and has sharply declined through August. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand of 107, 46, 69, and 116, with an average of 84.5 units/period. The current inventory position is high: On-hand inventory is 471 units and In-transit is 182 units (from orders in P26 and P27), totaling 653 units available to cover upcoming demand. With a lead time of 4 periods, total coverage needed is for 5 periods. Even at the August average of ~85 units, 653 units covers over 7 periods of demand. Consequently, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized lower demand level (avg ~93) and use lead time calculation based on historical consistency (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August (P26-P29) at an average of 85 units/period, confirming the end of the summer peak and a return to baseline levels for Jersey Basics as the season transitions to autumn.

While the carry-over insights correctly noted a return to baseline (avg ~85), the last two periods (P29, P30) show a slight uptick to 116 and 136, likely representing early autumn demand or simple variance. On-hand inventory is very high (477 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the summer peak (P24-P26). With a current holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the mean demand over the risk horizon. The risk horizon (L+1) is 5 periods. Based on the recent 4-period average (92 units/period), the required inventory to cover 5 periods is ~460 units. Since current inventory (On-hand: 477 + In-transit: 40 = 517) already exceeds this level, I will set parameters to prevent further ordering while maintaining a realistic forecast. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent post-peak behavior.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P29-P30) shows a slight increase from late August lows, with a 2-period average of 126 vs. the theoretical August baseline of 85, suggesting a potential early autumn stabilization or minor uptick for Jersey Basics.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts has stabilized after the late August lows, with the last three periods (P29-P31) averaging 128 units/period (116, 136, 134). This suggests a steady early-autumn demand level higher than the late August baseline (~85) but lower than the summer peak (~190). On-hand inventory is currently high at 383 units with no units in transit. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (~3 periods of cover), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime to capture the current stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September (P29-P31) at an average of 128 units/period, showing a slight uptick and plateau compared to the late August baseline (~85).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts has stabilized after the summer peak, following an August low. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 123.75 units (116, 136, 134, 109), showing a consistent early-autumn level that is higher than the late-August baseline of ~85 but significantly lower than the July peak of ~200. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent stabilization (recent_N=4). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P28-P31). On-hand inventory is 274 plus 147 in-transit (ordered P32), totaling 421 units. With a target base stock based on a mean of ~124 over 5 periods (L+1), the current pipeline is slightly below the required coverage, justifying the automated order calculation by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September (P29-P32) at an average of 124 units/period, showing a consistent early-autumn plateau for Jersey Basics.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts has stabilized into an autumn plateau following the summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 131 units, which is consistent with the early-autumn regime identified in Carry-over Insights (approx. 124-128 units). On-hand inventory is 114 units, and in-transit inventory is 293 units (from orders in P32 and P33), totaling 407 units of pipeline stock. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~130 per period, we need roughly 650 units of total stock (130 * 5). The current pipeline (407) is insufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized early-autumn plateau while ignoring the extremely low late-August samples. Lead time (L) remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand for P29-P33 is 131 units/period, establishing a stable early-autumn regime for Jersey Basics above the late-summer baseline (~85).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the early autumn regime for Jersey Basics. Looking at the demand history since the late-August transition (P29), demand has been: 116, 136, 134, 109, 160, 70. This averages 121 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the average is 122 units/period. While P34 showed a dip to 70, the overall autumn plateau remains stable compared to the late-summer baseline. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (last arrival confirmation in P31 for an order placed in P27). Orders placed in P32, P33, and P34 are currently in transit and expected to arrive in P36, P37, and P38 respectively. On-hand inventory is low (44), but the pipeline is healthy (457). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current autumn demand regime while smoothing out the P34 dip, and maintain the promised lead time of 4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts is currently in a post-summer/early-autumn phase. Period 34 (late September) saw a sharp drop to 70 units, followed by another drop to 43 units in Period 35 (early October). This suggests the 'Autumn Plateau' (avg ~131) noted in the Carry-over Insights is ending, and we are entering a lower-demand late-autumn regime. The current on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit), but there is a significant pipeline of 565 units. Specifically, orders from Period 32 (147 units), Period 33 (146 units), Period 34 (164 units), and Period 35 (108 units) are in transit. With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we expect the 147 units ordered in P32 to arrive in the current Period 36 (visible in P37), followed by 146 units in P37, and 164 units in P38. Since the mean demand of the last two periods has dropped to approximately 56.5 units/period ( (70+43)/2 ), the existing pipeline of 565 units is more than sufficient to cover the next 4-5 periods of demand. Placing additional large orders now would lead to excessive holding costs as demand continues its seasonal decline. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical lead time consistency and use a 'recent_N' of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the current downward trend) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on the higher September averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in October (Period 34-35): Mean demand dropped to 56.5 units/period from the September autumn plateau of ~131 (-57%), signaling the transition to late-autumn/winter low-season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck' has significantly shifted into a low-season regime as of mid-October (P34-P36). The September plateau of ~131 units/period has dropped to a mean of 57 units over the last three periods (P34-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 90 units, with a large pipeline of 418 units (ordered in P33-P35) arriving over the next three weeks. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods and the current pipeline already covers over 7 weeks of demand at the new low-season rate (~57 units/period), no new orders are required. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent late-autumn demand drop and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period arrival remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in late October: Mean demand for P34-P36 is 57 units/period, confirming the transition from the September autumn plateau (~131) to a low-season baseline for Jersey Basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a late-autumn/winter low-season for this Jersey V-neck T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a lower level following the September plateau. The average demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) is 58.75 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 172 units, and there are 272 units in-transit (ordered in P34 and P35). Specifically, 164 units ordered in P34 are expected to arrive in P38, and 108 units ordered in P35 are expected in P39. Given the low-season demand, the pipeline inventory (172 on-hand + 272 in-transit = 444 units) is extremely high, covering approximately 7-8 weeks of current demand. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this late-autumn demand regime and maintain the default lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in Period 39. The product is a Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt, which has seen two clear seasonal peaks (Spring/March and Summer/July). Since October (Period 34), demand has entered a significant low-season regime. The mean demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) is 55.4 units (70, 43, 58, 64, 42). Current on-hand inventory is 294 units, which is quite high relative to this low-season demand (covering approximately 5.3 periods of demand). Total pipeline inventory is 108 units (ordered in P35), which is expected to arrive in Period 39. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 402 units. Given the target service level (q = 0.5 since profit = holding cost = $1), the OR backend targets a base stock roughly equal to (L+1) * mean_demand. With L=4, target stock is ~5 * 55.4 = 277 units. Since current total inventory (402) exceeds this requirement, no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent N=5 low-season regime to ensure the OR engine recognizes the lower demand environment and avoids over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn/early winter (Nov): Mean demand for P34-P38 is 55.4 units/period, down from the September average of ~131, confirming a sustained low-season baseline for Jersey Basics.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is deep into the late-autumn/winter low season for women's jersey basics. Recent demand has confirmed a significant drop: P39 demand was only 27 units, and the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 47 units, down from the September plateau of ~131. My current on-hand inventory is 375 units with 0 units in-transit. With an average demand of ~47 units and a lead time of 4 periods, I have approximately 8 periods of stock on-hand, which is far in excess of the approximately 5 periods (L+1) required to maintain service levels. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this low-season mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the reduced requirement and avoids further accumulation of holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn/early winter (Nov): Mean demand for P35-P39 is 46.8 units/period, confirming a sustained low-season baseline for Jersey Basics, significantly lower than the preceding autumn plateau of ~131.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-autumn/winter low-season (mid-November). Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P35-P40) has averaged 44.8 units/period, significantly lower than the preceding autumn plateau of ~125. The current on-hand inventory of 340 units is substantial and covers more than 7 periods of current baseline demand (340 / 44.8 \u2248 7.6). There are no units in-transit, as previous orders (up to P35) have all arrived on their promised 4-period lead time. Given the high inventory and falling seasonal demand, no additional orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current low-season regime (P35-P40), while keeping L at default (4). The backend will naturally compute a zero order because on-hand exceeds the required base stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic' V-neck T-shirt has stabilized in a late-autumn/winter low-season regime. Since late October (Period 36), demand has consistently remained below 65 units, with the most recent four periods (P38-P41) averaging only 32.5 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 314 units is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time), which is estimated to be around 160-200 units at current levels. As we are approaching the end of the year (Period 42 of 47), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5: P37-P41) to capture this established low-season baseline while utilizing the 'default' lead time which has remained consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-season baseline confirmed for November (P38-P41): demand has stabilized at an average of 32.5 units/period, down from the October average of ~57.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-194.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, approaching a 47-period horizon. In the most recent period (P42), demand was 60, up from the previous three weeks which averaged ~30. This likely reflects a minor holiday uptick or a one-off fluctuation. However, the overall regime remains 'low-season' compared to the summer peak. We are currently in a high inventory state (254 on-hand) with zero in-transit, as previous orders cleared the summer/autumn demand surges. Given that demand has recently been between 26 and 60 (mean of last 4 is ~37), the current on-hand inventory of 254 units covers approximately 6-7 periods of demand. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have sufficient coverage, a 'default' or slightly conservative setting is appropriate to prevent further overstocking during the low season. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current low-season baseline (mean ~37) while acknowledging the recent slight uptick.

Carry-over insight: Low-season baseline confirmed for November/early-December (P39-P42): demand averaged 37 units/period, despite a slight uptick to 60 in P42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9th (Period 44) with 4 periods left in the game. On-hand inventory is 239 units, with 0 units in-transit. Demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged 32.6 units/period (27, 35, 26, 60, 15), confirming the low-season baseline for jersey basics mentioned in carry-over insights. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and only 4 periods remaining, any order placed now would arrive in Period 48 (the resolution of Period 47), which is the final window for arrivals. However, current on-hand inventory (239) is already more than sufficient to cover expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (approx 33 units/period * 4 = 132 units). Ordering more would only increase holding costs without facilitating additional sales. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low demand environment, and since the on-hand stock is high, the OR backend will correctly decide not to place further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-193.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). The game ends at Period 47. Inventory on-hand is 216 units, which is extremely high relative to the recent low-season demand. In the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged 31 units per period (27, 35, 26, 60, 15, 23). There are only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47). Total expected demand for the remaining duration is roughly 90-100 units. Since current on-hand (216) already covers more than double the remaining expected demand and we have no units in-transit, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed to minimize holding costs. Lead time L is kept at default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low-season regime (approx 31 units/period), although the inventory surplus is the primary driver for a zero-order outcome from the backend.

Carry-over insight: Low-season baseline confirmed for Dec (P39-P44): demand averaged 31 units/period, maintaining the stable low-season regime for Jersey Basics into the end of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). The product is a Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt, which is currently in its low-season demand regime. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P39-P45) has been consistently low, averaging 29 units per period (27, 35, 26, 60, 15, 23, 17). The current on-hand inventory is 199 units, which covers approximately 6.8 periods of demand at the current average. Given that the lead time is 4 periods and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), maintaining excess inventory is costly and provides no relative reward. There are no units in transit. I will use a recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this low-season baseline. The backend base-stock calculation will likely result in a zero order given the high current inventory relative to the low demand and 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final period (Period 47, Dec 30) of the game. The demand regime has stabilized into a low-season baseline for Jersey Basics, with the average demand for the last five periods (P42-P46) being 26.2 units. There is a current on-hand inventory of 183 units and 0 units in-transit. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand. With 183 units on-hand and a current demand run-rate of ~26 units, we have over 7 periods of supply available. Ordering more would lead to unnecessary holding costs as we conclude the simulation. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N (N=8) to reflect the low-season regime (P39-P46 mean ~27.75), which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than our current on-hand, ensuring no new orders are placed.
