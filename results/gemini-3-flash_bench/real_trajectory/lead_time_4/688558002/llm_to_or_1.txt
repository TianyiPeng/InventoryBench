Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 688558002 ('Brittany LS' top). Looking at the provided demand history (Jan 7 to Feb 4), there is a clear upward trend: 6, 11, 48, 72, 90. The mean of the last 3 samples is 70, while the average across all 5 samples is 45.4. Given the product's identity as a 'long-sleeved top' and the seasonality (approaching mid-February), we are in a growing demand regime. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since demand is trending up sharply, using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat better captures the current market momentum than the all-history average. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=3 will reflect the increased volatility seen during this growth phase. We will use the 'default' lead time (4) as there is no observed delivery history to suggest otherwise yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a fitted, long-sleeved jersey top, which typically sees demand growth in early spring. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 6, 11, 48, 72, 90 (pre-game) and 67 (Period 1). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 105 units in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect the first order to arrive until Period 5. Period 1 demand (67) was slightly lower than the most recent pre-game samples but still confirms a high-demand regime compared to early January. Given the zero on-hand inventory and the lead time, we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts when the supply chain catches up. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~69 units/period) while accounting for the growth from earlier periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved top), which is currently seeing a significant demand surge (samples: 6, 11, 48, 72, 90; recent game history: 67, 128). This suggests a strong upward trend/regime shift as we enter spring. Total in-transit is 203 units (from Period 1 and 2 orders). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at P6). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and missing sales. Since we have only 5 historical samples + 2 game lead samples, and demand is accelerating, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the upward trajectory. For L, I will stay with default (4) as no orders have arrived to prove otherwise. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand; with demand clearly trending above 100 units/week, the OR engine needs to base its calculation on the most recent high-demand periods to avoid under-ordering during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from avg ~10 in early Jan up to 128 in mid-Feb. Sustained upward trend identified over last 4 weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'Jersey Basic' top, which is entering a peak spring season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Jan demand was low (avg ~9), but Feb demand spiked to 67, 128, and 123 (avg ~106 over the last 3 periods). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 338 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 have not arrived yet, which is consistent with the 4-period lead time (the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message read at P6). To capture the recent high demand while acknowledging the seasonal nature of basics, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility of the current regime. L remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Feb demand averaged 106 units/week compared to Jan avg of ~9. Seasonal growth for Jersey Basic category is sustained.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Brittany LS' fitted jersey top, which is seeing a significant upward trend as spring approaches. Historical demand has climbed from ~10 in early Jan to an average of 98.25 over the last 4 periods (67, 128, 123, 75). Despite ordering every period since P1, on-hand inventory remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from P1 (105 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 and should be visible in the P5 conclude message (available at P6 start). Since L=4, the base stock must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using N=4 for mu_hat yields a mean of 98.25, and (1+4)*98.25 = 491.25. However, demand seems to be stabilizing at a higher level than the early Jan baseline. I will use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime while we await our first shipment to stock the 'On-hand' inventory. Total In-transit is 500 units, which roughly matches our current lead-time demand estimate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 Conclusion (read now in Period 6) with a lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, we have 31 units on hand and 503 units in transit. Demand history (Jan-Mar) shows a distinct shift: Jan avg was ~9, but the last 5 weeks (Feb 11 to Mar 11) have averaged 93.4 units (67, 128, 123, 75, 74). This confirms the 'Jersey Basic' category seasonal uptick. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Review (1) + Lead Time (4) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 captures the post-January demand regime shift. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock of roughly (1+4) * 93.4 = 467 units. After subtracting 503 in-transit and 31 on-hand (total 534), the OR engine may order 0 or very little this period, which is appropriate given our heavy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime for Feb-Mar stabilized at avg ~93 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1511.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the product is in its stable spring demand regime (Feb-Mar avg ~93 units/week). The confirmed lead time is 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is 47, with 447 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 494 units. Based on an L+1=5 period horizon and an average demand of ~93, the required base stock is approximately 465 plus a safety buffer. Current pipeline (494) is slightly above this mean requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable demand period since the Feb spike, and set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently observed.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a long-sleeved basic jersey top. Historical lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand history shows a peak in mid-February followed by stabilization from mid-March: P4(75), P5(74), P6(82), P7(75). This averages to ~76.5 units per week. The Carry-over insight for Period 6 noted a stabilization around 93, but the 4 most recent weeks (P4-P7) show a slightly lower, more consistent mean of 76.5. Since the promised lead time (4) matches the observed lead time, L is set to default. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the stabilized demand level across the (L+1)=5 period window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility (std dev ~3.4), ensuring the OR backend maintains appropriate safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable for mid-March through April 1st, averaging ~77 units/week (reduction from the high Feb levels). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a jersey basic top. Demand history shows a peak in February (avg ~106) followed by a slightly lower, stable regime from March to April (avg ~81 units over the last 5 weeks). Specifically, the last four weeks of demand were 74, 82, 75, and 92. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 1 through Period 4 confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 177, with 213 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7). To set the OR parameters: L is set to calculated (confirmed at 4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stable demand regime observed since mid-March (avg ~81/week), which balances the slightly higher recent demand (92) with the previous weeks. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-March through early April stabilized at avg ~81 units/week (+/- 10). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (Jersey Basic top) is currently in a stable demand phase following a February peak. Since early March (Period 4), weekly demand has fluctuated between 39 and 92 units, with the most recent week showing a drop to 39. The average demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 5-9) is approximately 72.4 units ([74+82+75+92+39]/5). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival logs for orders from Periods 1 through 5. Currently, we have 246 units on-hand and 142 in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, 9), totaling 388 units of system inventory. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (Lead time + Review period). 388 units / 72.4 avg demand \u2248 5.36 weeks of coverage, which is slightly above our target but safe. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the confirmed history, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the post-peak stability and recent dip, allowing the OR engine to adjust the order quantity downward while maintaining a high service level for this profitable item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further (Periods 5-9): Average demand shifted to ~72 units/week following the Feb-peak, with a notable dip in the most recent week (P9). Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

This likely reflects a seasonal shift as warmer weather approaches, reducing demand for long-sleeved basics. On-hand inventory is high (257) with 148 units still in transit (orders from P7, P9, P10; the P8 order was 0). Promised lead time is 4 periods and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent sharp decline and ensure the OR backend's base-stock target reflects the current lower sales rate, preventing further overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand has dropped significantly in April (P9-P10 avg ~35 units) compared to March (avg ~81 units), likely due to seasonal transition away from long-sleeved items.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (Brittany LS, a long-sleeved top) is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late April. Demand has shifted from a February-March average of ~85 units/period to an average of ~39 units/period over the last three weeks (P9=39, P10=31, P11=48). On-hand inventory is currently high (272 units) due to arrivals from orders placed during the higher-demand period. With a lead time consistently at 4 periods, we must forecast demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand regime (avg ~40). This results in a mu_hat of ~200 ( (1+4) * 40 ). Since current on-hand inventory (272) already exceeds this total expected demand for the pipeline duration, the OR backend will correctly minimize new orders to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: April demand consolidated at a lower average of ~40 units/period (compared to Q1 avg of ~85), reflecting seasonal transition for long-sleeved items.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, demand for this long-sleeved 'Jersey Basic' top peaked in February and has steadily declined through April (averaging ~40 units/period over the last 4 weeks). The 'arrived=0' in Period 12 is expected because no order was placed in Period 8. On-hand inventory is currently high (229 units) relative to the recent demand rate (~40 units/period), covering over 5 periods of demand. Pipeline inventory is 99 units (orders from P9, P10, P11). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the seasonal transition into warmer weather and high existing stock, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4-week average (N=4) to project a lower mean demand for the (L+1) horizon, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect recent volatility. This will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to burn off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved top) is experiencing a sustained downward demand trend as the season transitions into late spring/early summer. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 37.8 units/period, significantly lower than the February peak. In Period 13, demand dropped further to 28 units. On-hand inventory is high at 238 units, which represents approximately 6 periods of supply at current demand rates. There are also 62 units in transit (expected arrivals from Period 10 and 11 orders). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and decreasing demand for long-sleeved items, I will use recent history (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the new lower-demand regime and preventing excess accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late spring (P9-P13) has stabilized at a lower average of ~38 units/period, down from the ~80 seen in March, confirming the seasonal exit of long-sleeved jersey tops.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which has entered a clear low-demand seasonal phase. Since Period 9, demand has stabilized at an average of 37 units per period (range 28-48). On-hand inventory is currently high at 254 units, and in-transit inventory is 14 units (the order from Period 11). Total inventory (268 units) far exceeds the requirement for the 5-period risk horizon ((1+L) * 37 = 185 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high excess of inventory (enough for ~7 weeks of demand) and the seasonal decline for long-sleeved items, the goal is to prevent any further orders while the stock burns down. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low-demand regime since April, allowing the OR backend to calculate a base stock lower than the current pipeline, resulting in zero new orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved top) has entered a low-demand phase as the summer season approaches in late May. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~120 units in February to a stable average of approximately 34 units/period over the last 7 weeks (P9-P15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 242 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 7 weeks of supply. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods (L+1=5), my goal is to satisfy demand while reducing the high holding costs ($1/unit/period) by letting on-hand inventory bleed down. No new orders are needed (pipeline inventory is 0, on-hand is already > base stock targets). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the lower late-spring demand regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (688558002), which has seen a significant seasonal decline as we move into June (Period 17). Demand has dropped from a peak of ~100+ units in February/March to a stable low-volume regime of ~28 units/week over the last 4 periods (P13-P16). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 217 units, while the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 140 units (5 * 28). Since on-hand inventory (217) significantly exceeds the required base stock, the OR engine will likely correctly order 0 units to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this lower, late-spring/early-summer demand state.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P13-P16): Demand for long-sleeved items has stabilized at a low average of ~28 units/period, reflecting seasonal minimums.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in a seasonal low (summer). Demand has stabilized at a low average of ~28 units per period over the last 5 weeks (Periods 13-17: 28, 32, 26, 25, 30). On-hand inventory is 187 units, which is significantly higher than the quantity needed to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (1+L = 5 periods). With an expected demand of ~28 units/period, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 140 units. Since 187 > 140, the system should not place new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved top) is currently in a low-demand summer phase. Over the last six periods (P13-P18), demand has been consistently low, averaging 27.5 units/period (28, 32, 26, 25, 30, 24). The inventory on hand is 163 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 138 units (5 * 27.5). Our current on-hand inventory of 163 units is more than sufficient to cover this expected demand plus a safety buffer, especially considering the product's high holding cost ($1) and the likely continued low interest in long-sleeved items in mid-June. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (since the start of the current low-demand stability) to reflect this low-volume regime and avoid ordering excess stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved top) is currently in a summer seasonal low. Demand has continued to decline from the ~80 range in March to a recent average of ~25 units per period over the last 7 weeks (P13-P19). The most recent demand (Period 19) was 15 units, suggesting the downward trend or low-level stabilization is continuing as expected for a long-sleeved item in late June. Current on-hand inventory is 148 units with zero in-transit. Based on the recent average demand of ~25, our 148 units cover nearly 6 weeks of supply, which is slightly above the target level for a 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, the OR backend will likely not place an order yet. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current low-demand summer regime accurately while ignoring the high-demand spring data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Periods 13-19 demand averaged ~25.7 units/week, down from ~80 in March and ~40 in April, consistent with seasonal minimums for long-sleeved jersey tops.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved jersey top) is in a summer seasonal low. Current demand has hit a floor, with the last two periods (P19-P20) showing only 15 and 12 units respectively, and an over-all average of ~25.7 units/week since P13. On-hand inventory is 136 units, which at the current burn rate of ~15-25 units/week covers over 5-8 weeks of demand - significantly exceeding the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks). There is 1 unit in-transit (ordered P20), which is negligible. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this low-demand summer regime accurately while ignoring the higher Q1 peaks. The lead time L is maintained at the stable 'default' promised value of 4, consistent with historical arrivals.

Specifically, from Period 19 to 21, demand has been very low (15, 12, 17 units respectively, averaging ~14.7). The carry-over insights correctly identified a summer floor averaging ~25.7 units/week earlier, but recent weeks suggest it might be dipping slightly lower. On-hand inventory is 119, which comfortably covers over 5 periods of current demand (14.7 * 5 = 73.5), meaning no significant ordering is required. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have sufficient stock for the lead time plus the review period at current low demand rates (demand/period ~15-20), I will set mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21) to capture this summer trough and avoid over-ordering as we maintain high service levels. Sigma_hat is also calculated over recent periods to reflect the narrowed variance during this low-demand phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of summer (July 15). Demand has remained consistent with the summer 'floor' regime identified in Period 20, averaging approximately 24 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P13-P22). With 87 units on-hand and 10 in-transit (total pipeline of 97), and a lead time of 4 periods, we currently hold roughly 4 weeks of cover. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), and an average demand of ~24, the objective base stock (target inventory) is roughly 120 units. My current pipeline (97) is slightly below this, but given the seasonal nature (long sleeves in July), I will maintain a conservative stance using the recent historical mean to avoid overstocking before the late-summer/autumn transition. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4, and use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable summer demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of summer (July). Demand has remained consistent with the summer 'floor' identified in the carry-over insights. From Period 13 to Period 23, the average demand is approximately 23.7 units/period. The most recent five periods (P19-P23) show an average of 19.2 units, though there was a slight uptick in P22 (32 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 67 and in-transit at 46 (total 113), the stock position is roughly 5-6 weeks of coverage based on current demand. I will use recent_N=11 (Periods 13-23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full summer regime, setting L to calculate as the lead time is stable.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved jersey top) is in its summer trough, but we are approaching late July/early August (Period 25). Historically, demand for long-sleeved items starts to recover in late Q3 as shoppers prepare for the autumn transition. Recent demand (P20-P24) has been low: 12, 17, 32, 20, 17 (average ~20 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P20 order arriving in P24. Currently, we have 51 units on hand and 76 units in transit (P21: 9, P23: 36, P24: 31). Total pipeline is 127 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (P25-P29). While recent average is 20, I expect demand to gradually increase above the summer plateaus identified in 'Carry-over insights'. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability, but will monitor for an upward shift in the coming weeks. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). The SKU 688558002 is a long-sleeved jersey top, which typically sees its lowest demand during summer and starts to trend upward as fall approaches. Recent demand (Periods 20-25) has been low, averaging approximately 18 units/week. However, historical samples from early in the year (Jan/Feb) showed a rapid climb from ~10 to over 100 units/week. As we enter August, we anticipate the start of the 'Back-to-School' or early autumn seasonal shift. On-hand inventory is 49 units, with 67 units in transit (ordered P23 and P24) expected to arrive in Periods 27 and 28. To prepare for the potential seasonal uptick while managing holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a slightly more reactive 10-week window (N=10) to capture the recent low floor while allowing the OR engine to start incorporating the inevitable upward trend as it manifests in the weekly data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 12, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top. Historically, this product saw a demand peak in Feb/Mar (~80-100 units/week) and hit a summer floor in June/July (~15-25 units/week). We are now entering mid-August, which typically marks the start of the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn transition in retail, where demand for long-sleeved items begins to recover from summer lows. Recent demand in Period 26 was 27 units, slightly above the summer average. However, the pipeline inventory (80 units) plus on-hand (22 units) totaling 102 units is relatively lean if a significant autumn ramp-up occurs (L=4 means we are covering demand through mid-September). I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand to capture the very start of this transition while maintaining the established lead time of 4. This balances the risk of holding too much summer-weighted inventory against the expected seasonal uptick.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. Demand for 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved top) has shown a sharp increase in the last two periods (P26: 27, P27: 56), marking an exit from the summer low (~20-25 units). This aligns with seasonal restocking for the autumn/back-to-school period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), with 79 units in-transit (P24: 31, P26: 13, P27: 35). To capture this seasonal shift, I will use a recent_N method for demand (N=5) to reflect the recent uptick, while setting Lead Time to the observed 4-period constant. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient for the upcoming higher-demand regime while accounting for the significant pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Autumn recovery started as demand rose from ~25 to 56 units/period, consistent with seasonal transition for long-sleeved items.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved jersey top) has officially entered the autumn recovery phase. Demand in Period 27 was 56 and Period 28 was 52, compared to the summer average of ~25. This pivot aligns with late August seasonal shifts. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) and missed 19 units of demand in Period 28. In-transit inventory is 104 units (ordered in Periods 26, 27, 28). With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to set parameters based on the new demand regime (recent_N=2) to quickly restock and cover the anticipated climb. The OR backend needs to recognize the higher mean (~54) to order enough to satisfy the (L+1) period window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand for long-sleeved items increased to ~54 units/period (average P27-P28), doubling from the summer floor of ~25.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) has entered its autumn recovery phase as expected. Demand in Period 27/28 jumped significantly (~54 units/period), although Period 29 saw a dip to 32 units. Historically, from Period 1 to Period 3 (Feb), demand surged from 67 to 123, suggesting that the seasonal ramp-up in autumn/winter can be very sharp. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 163 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29). A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P23 and P24 arrivals. For Period 30, the OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent autumn recovery average (~46.7 units/period) while allowing for the high volatility (sigma) observed during change periods. This positioning ensures that as we move into September, the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to service the seasonal climb while accounting for the current stock-out.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September transition (2019/9/9), where demand for long-sleeved jersey tops is aggressively recovering toward Q1 levels. Demand jumped to 80 units in Period 30, following the late-August recovery. However, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand = 0 for the last three periods) because summer inventory levels were insufficient for this autumn surge. A significant pipeline of 221 units is in transit, but near-term availability is critical. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have seen a clear shift from the summer floor (~25) to a new autumn regime (~55-80), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward trajectory (Periods 27-30). This ensures \u03bc\u0302 reflects the latest growth without being over-influenced by the summer lows or the extreme peak from Feb. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the current volatility during the seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 80 units, up from ~54 in late August, indicating a faster-than-expected return to peak Q1 demand levels for long-sleeved items.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is experiencing a powerful seasonal autumn surge. Demand has aggressively spiked from ~52-80 in late August to 152 in the most recent period (P31). This mirrors the high demand seen in early Q1. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) with significant lost sales in P31 (117 units lost). Pipeline inventory is 274, but given the lead time of 4 periods, we are in a stockout recovery phase. To capture the current momentum and prevent further stockouts as we enter peak autumn, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) which capture the surge (avg ~88, scaled by L+1). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility during this trend shift. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Radical demand surge confirmed. Weekly demand jumped from 80 (P30) to 152 (P31), exceeding previous Q1 peaks. Preparing for high autumn volume.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) is experiencing a massive autumn demand surge. Demand has escalated from ~50 units in August to 152 in Period 31 and 153 in Period 32, which is significantly higher than the peak demand seen in Q1 (approx 128). This indicates a strong seasonal shift as we enter late September. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand inventory = 0) despite continuous arrivals, confirming demand is currently far outpacing supply. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the new demand regime of ~150 units/week. Over 5 periods (L+1), this requires a base stock covering ~750 units. With 383 units in transit, the OR backend will order the difference to catch up, subject to the safety cap. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this new high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~152 units/period (avg P31-P32), exceeding the Feb peak of ~128. Product is in a high-velocity seasonal phase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Brittany LS' (fitted, long-sleeved top) has entered an extreme surge phase as of late September (Period 33 demand: 522). This is significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 150 units observed in Periods 31-32, likely driven by the seasonal transition to autumn/winter. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a recurring stockout situation despite arrivals. Total in-transit inventory is 543, but given the target base stock formula (L+1 period coverage), this is insufficient for a demand level exceeding 500 units/period with a 4-period lead time (Total 5 periods of demand to cover). To aggressive capture this peak while balancing the risk of a plateau, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to mirror the new demand level (period 33) and captured the higher volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P29 arrived in P33).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Radical surge in autumn demand for long-sleeved items, jumping from ~153 to 522 units/period (+240%). Confirming hyper-seasonal peak phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1349.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked massively to 522 units, but Period 34 showed a significant decrease to 192 units. While still much higher than early summer levels, this indicates the 'hyper-peak' may have been a one-time outlier or a very short-lived spike, stabilizing now at a high autumn level (avg. P31-P34 is ~255 units). We currently have 0 on-hand and 1326 units in-transit, largely driven by the massive order of 854 units placed last period (P34). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the volatility (192 vs 522), I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent average of ~255 units per period across the lead time plus review period (5 periods), which totals 1275. However, since we already have 1326 in transit, the OR backend's base-stock logic (capped by its own internal logic) will likely result in a small or zero order this period to avoid overstocking if demand continues at the 200-level rather than the 500-level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spike: After the Period 33 peak (522), demand in Period 34 (192) suggests a high-volume autumn level averaging ~255 units/period (P31-P34) rather than sustained hyper-growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season for long-sleeved items. Recent demand shows a major spike: P33 (522), P34 (192), and P35 (130). While the massive P33 value may have been a one-time peak or outlier, the average demand of the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 229 units/period. The current ending inventory is 0, and despite having 1779 units in-transit, the system has experienced stockouts for the last 8 periods due to demand outstripping the lead-time pipeline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the autumn regime) provides an average of 229.8 units per period, which aligns with the observed sustained volume. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen during this transition. This strategy ensures the OR backend attempts to build a sufficient base stock (targeting ~1150 units for L+1) to satisfy current demand and recover from the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand for long-sleeved items (P31-P35) averages ~230 units/period, marking a significant increase from summer levels (~25) and Q1 peaks (~120). Demand remains volatile but high-volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1935.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the October autumn/winter peak for long-sleeved items. Historical demand has been extremely volatile, featuring a massive spike of 522 (P33) followed by stabilization around 130-105 in the most recent two weeks. The 'in-transit' pipeline is currently very high (1614 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 34 and 35 (854 and 541 units respectively), which are expected to arrive in Periods 38 and 39. My goal is to prevent a massive overstock once these large orders arrive. On-hand inventory is 60, and we have a 165-unit arrival scheduled for Period 37 (from P33 order). Total current inventory (on-hand 60 + arrival 165 = 225) is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand (avg ~150). Given the massive inflow coming next period, I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-spike stabilization levels (~160 per week) using recent_N=6 to capture the volatile autumn phase (P31-P36). This will signal to the OR engine that the pipeline is already saturated, likely resulting in a zero order for this period to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter stabilization post-spike (P31-P36): Demand has settled from a peak of 522 to an average of ~209 units/period, but most recent two weeks (P35-P36) average ~117, suggesting the hyper-peak is passing into a steady high-volume phase.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (late October) shows demand has stabilized following the hyper-peak in September. Recent demand (P34-P37) has been 192, 130, 105, and 123, averaging approximately 137 units/period. This is significantly lower than the P33 spike (522) but higher than the P31-P32 levels (approx 152). On-hand inventory is 156, and there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 1,395 units (primarily from a large order of 854 in P34 and 541 in P35). Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, the P34 order (854 units) is expected to arrive in Period 38's resolution phase. Given the pipeline significantly exceeds any realistic demand forecast (approx 137 * 5 = 685 units for L+1), the OR backend should naturally stop ordering. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization level (~137 units) and allow the system to bleed off the excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-September hyper-peak: Period 34-37 average demand is ~137 units/period, significantly lower than the P33 peak (522) but confirming a high-volume Q4 baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), which remains a high-volume period for long-sleeved jersey tops. Although demand spiked significantly in late September (reaching 522), it has stabilized considerably over the last five weeks (P34-P38), averaging approximately 141 units/period (values: 192, 130, 105, 123, 156). On-hand inventory is currently high (854 units) due to the large order from Period 34 arriving in Period 38. With an additional 541 units in-transit (ordered in Period 35 and expected to arrive in Period 39/40), the current pipeline is substantial. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Given the stabilization of demand after the hyper-peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary post-spike regime while maintaining an explicit sigma_hat that accounts for the historical volatility observed during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed (P34-P38): Demand for long-sleeved items has settled into a steady high-volume regime averaging ~141 units/period after the late September hyper-peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 40 (Nov 11, 2019). The SKU, a fitted long-sleeved jersey top, is entering the late autumn/early winter season. Historically, demand peaked in September (Period 33 saw 522 units) and has since stabilized. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 79 units, following a sequence of 156, 123, 105, and 130. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 118 units/period. On-hand inventory is very high at 1,316 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the hyper-peak phase (P34 and P35). Since the pipeline is empty and on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover more than 10 weeks of current demand levels (1316 / ~118), the priority shifts from aggressive replenishment to inventory depletion to minimize holding costs. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 reflects the current post-peak stability, while sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed (P35-P39): Demand for long-sleeved items has averaged ~118 units/period, down from the September hyper-peak but significantly higher than summer floors. Inventory is currently in a surplus state.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered a post-peak stabilization phase following a massive demand spike in late September (Period 33). For the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 111.8 units/week, down from the hyper-peak but significantly higher than summer levels. Large orders placed in Periods 34 and 35 (854 and 541 units respectively) have now arrived, resulting in a substantial inventory surplus of 1,220 units on-hand. With the current average weekly demand around 112 units, this stock covers approximately 11 weeks of sales. Given we are at Period 41 of 47, no further orders are necessary to meet remaining demand for the duration of the game. I will set the lead time parameter 'L' to 'calculate' (stable at 4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current post-peak regime. The OR backend will see the high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock and correctly place zero further orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization (P36-P40): Demand for long-sleeved items consolidated at an average of ~112 units/period after the September hyper-peak. High inventory levels (1200+) currently exceed total remaining expected demand for the season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved jersey top) is in the late stages of its Q4 peak. Current period is 42, with only 5 periods remaining in the game (ends at 47). On-hand inventory is very high at 1146 units, which is significantly more than the total expected demand for the remaining duration (avg ~100 units/period * 5 periods = 500 units). Demand has stabilized at an average of ~112 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P37-P41). Given the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout (we have >10 weeks of supply on hand), no further orders should be placed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current stabilized demand regime while ensuring the OR engine does not trigger new orders by utilizing the default calculation methods, which will result in a base stock lower than current inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (Brittany LS jersey top) is entering its end-of-year seasonal phase (Early December). The current on-hand inventory is 836 units. Recent demand in Period 42 showed a significant spike to 310 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales events. Despite this spike, with only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P43) would only arrive in Period 47 resolution, which is the final step. Given the average demand post-peak has been ~112 units (excluding the holiday spike) and even accounting for higher December volume, the 836 units currently on hand are more than sufficient to cover the remaining simulation duration without further ordering. Ordering more would lead to excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period) and ending inventory penalties. I will maintain a zero-order strategy by setting parameters that reflect the current regime but keep target stock levels below current on-hand + pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in Period 42 (310 units), likely tied to late November promotional events. End-of-life simulation strategy initiated: on-hand inventory (836) is sufficient to cover remaining 5 periods of demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47. There are only 4 decision periods remaining (including this one). The current on-hand inventory is 787 units, plus 140 units in-transit (ordered in Period 43). The total available supply (927 units) must cover demand for the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47). Average demand post-September peak has been ~115 units/period (P35-P43 average: 111.3), with a single holiday spike of 310 in Period 42. Even assuming a high-end average of 150 units/period, the total remaining demand would be ~600 units. Since 927 > 600, we are in a significant inventory surplus. Ordering more would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales, as the stockout risk is effectively zero. I will set the lead time to the confirmed 4 periods and use the 'explicit' method with a value of 1 to signal to the OR backend that no further replenishment is required (by setting a base stock level far below current inventory).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-season phase (Period 45 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 729 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining demand for the last 3 periods (P45, P46, P47), considering the current post-holiday demand levels (~50-60 units/period). An additional 140 units are in-transit (ordered P43), arriving P47, which will only increase ending inventory and holding costs. According to the game rules, any inventory remaining at the end of the simulation incurs holding costs while not generating further profit. To maximize total reward, the objective is now to minimize ending inventory by placing no further orders. I am setting parameters to ensure the backend does not trigger a new order, given the massive surplus relative to the remaining time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Significant inventory surplus (729 units) confirmed for end-of-simulation. Total remaining demand for Periods 45-47 is estimated at ~150-200 units, ensuring no further procurement is necessary.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the simulation. The current state shows 674 units on-hand and 511 units in-transit. The game ends after Period 47's demand resolution. Even with the highest observed demand spike outside of the September hyper-peak (310 units in P42), the current stock of 674 units is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the remaining two periods (P46 and P47). Any additional orders placed now would arrive in Period 50 (based on a 4-period lead time), which is well beyond the simulation's end. To maximize reward, we must avoid further holding costs and maximize final inventory liquidation. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final decision period (Period 47) of the simulation. The current state shows 639 units on-hand and 511 units in-transit. Recent demand (P45-P46) has been 55 and 35 units respectively, following a post-holiday decline. Given that the simulation ends immediately following the resolution of Period 47, we have more than enough inventory (1,150 total available) to cover any conceivable demand for this single remaining period. There is no risk of stockout. The primary goal is to minimize further holding costs and avoid unnecessary procurement costs. I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend places a 0-unit order. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as it is stable at 4, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand to capture the current lower volume trend (~118 units/period excluding the P42 spike), though the specific values are academic given the massive inventory surplus.
