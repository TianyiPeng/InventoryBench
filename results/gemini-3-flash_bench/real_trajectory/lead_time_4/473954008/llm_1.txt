  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item 'OP Cheeky hipster 2p' is a basic women's lingerie item (microfibre hipster briefs). Demand for such staples is generally stable but can see modest lifts around Valentine's Day (Feb 14). b) Demand Analysis: Historical data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 shows demand ranging from 23 to 77, with an average of approximately 50.4 units per week. The current date is Feb 11, just before Valentine's Day, so a slight uptick might occur, though Feb 4 showed a lower 42. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With L=4, I need to cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the 4-period lead time window (P2-P5), totaling 5 periods of demand. d) Pipeline: On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. I am starting from a stockout position and must fill the pipeline immediately. e) Order Logic: Estimated weekly demand is ~50 units. To cover 5 periods (50 * 5 = 250 units) plus a small safety stock for the Valentine's period and initial uncertainty, I will order 300 units. Note: Since lead time is 4, these units won't arrive until Period 5 concludes, meaning they will be available for demand in Period 6.",

There is a shipment of 300 units in-transit (ordered P1). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+4) and be visible for decision-making in Period 6. This means demand for P3, P4, and P5 will likely be lost without further inventory. However, ordering more now would only arrive in P7 (P3+4), and there is already 300 units (roughly 5-6 weeks of stock) coming in P5. Adding more orders now risk high holding costs starting P7 if the 300 units are sufficient. However, I need to cover the lead-time pipeline. Calculating target inventory: Lead time (4) + Review Period (1) = 5 periods. At an average demand of 60, target pipeline should be ~300. Since 300 is already in-transit, I will not place an order this period to avoid overstocking, as the current in-transit covers the expected demand for the timeframe it will arrive in.",

My current inventory (138) almost exactly matches the target (140). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), and a sufficient stock to cover the next 4-5 periods at current demand rates, I will place a small order of 12 units to maintain a buffer and account for potential slight demand variance, ensuring the pipeline stays around 150 units.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 2-pack of microfibre cheeky hipster briefs, a basic lingerie item. We are currently at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Historically, demand for this item has shown two distinct peaks: a summer peak (Periods 15-24) and more recently, a pre-holiday ramp-up peaking in Period 37 (93 units). Recent demand (Periods 40-42) has leveled off to 32, 32, and 58 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 48.8 units. Given we are entering the December holiday season, demand for basic apparel often remains steady or sees a slight uptick. With a lead time of 4 periods, my current order must cover demand for Periods 43-47. Current inventory position: On-hand (105) + In-transit (210) = 315 units. Expected deliveries over the next 4 periods (based on past orders): P43: 70 units (from P39), P44: 70 units (from P40), P45: 70 units (from P41). I have 315 units to cover 5 periods (P43 to P47). At a forecast of ~60 units/period (accounting for holiday potential), total demand is 300. My pipeline (315) is sufficient to cover this. Since P47 is the final period of the game, I must avoid excess ending inventory to minimize holding costs, while ensuring I don't stock out. Current coverage is 5.25 periods at 60 units/period. Therefore, no additional order is needed this period.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 2-pack of microfibre cheeky hipster briefs, a basic lingerie item. We are currently at Period 44 (2019/12/09), which is the start of the holiday season peak. Historically, we saw a demand regime shift in late October/November (Period 38-41) but demand actually slowed down in late November (Periods 42-43: 58 and 24 units). However, given the proximity to Christmas and the 'basics' nature of the product, a mid-December spike (Periods 44-46) is likely. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The game ends at Period 47. Orders placed today (P44) will arrive in P48, which is after the game ends. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs (if any were modeled on order) or simply sit as in-transit without contributing to sales or reward. Current on-hand inventory is 151 units. Expected remaining demand for P44, P45, P46, and P47 is estimated at ~60 units/period (reflecting recent averages and seasonal potential). Total expected demand = 60 * 4 = 240 units. With 151 units on hand and 140 units in-transit (arriving in P44, P45, P46, and P47), the total pipeline is 291 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining periods and will likely result in a surplus (ending inventory) of ~50 units, which is a safe margin to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for the final periods.",

Demand analysis shows that following a summer peak and a pre-holiday ramp-up (Period 37 peak of 93), the current demand regime has cooled significantly.

Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's conclusion. Our current on-hand inventory is 182 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) given the recent average. Additionally, there are 70 units in-transit (ordered in P41) arriving in P45 resolution, which will further increase on-hand stock for the final two periods.

We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak holiday shopping week, followed by Period 47 (Dec 30), representing post-holiday/New Year demand. Historical demand in the recent regime (last 8 weeks) has averaged approximately 49 units, but with significant volatility (range 24-93). Period 45 saw a spike to 74 units, likely due to pre-holiday shopping. I expect demand for the next two periods to remain moderate to high (approx. 50-65 units) before potentially dipping in early January. Currently, on-hand inventory is 178 units with 0 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With an estimated avg demand of 50, I need approximately 250 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline (178 on-hand + 0 in-transit) is 178 units, leaving a deficit of 72 units. However, looking at the game's end condition (Period 47), any order placed now (Period 46) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive until Period 50, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, since there is more than enough on-hand inventory (178 units) to satisfy the expected demand for the remaining two periods (~100-130 units), no further orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs and ending inventory penalties.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 2-pack of microfibre hipster briefs (women's lingerie), which generally exhibits stable baseline demand with seasonal peaks. We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). Reviewing historical data for this time of year: late December and January (from the start of the game) show a gradual decline from holiday highs (P45 demand: 74, P46: 60) toward a mid-winter baseline that previously ranged from 23 to 77. The 'post-summer' stabilization regime was approximately 60 units, but recent weeks (P43-46) averaged 49 units, showing high volatility. With a 4-period lead time, an order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51. Inventory analysis: On-hand is 118, and there are 0 units in-transit (all orders up to P41 have arrived; P42 onward were zero orders). Since the lead time is 4, I need to cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51. Based on the 2019 early-year data (P1-P4 avg: ~50), I estimate demand at ~55 units/period for safety. Required inventory for 5 periods = 275. Current inventory (118) leaves a gap of 157 units to cover the pipeline until the next possible arrival. I will order 150 units to rebuild the pipeline and avoid stockouts in late January/early February.",
