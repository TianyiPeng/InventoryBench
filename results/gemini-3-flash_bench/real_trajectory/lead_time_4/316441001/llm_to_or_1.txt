Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 316441001 is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey.' Historically, demand has been stable but showing a slight upward trend in the last few weeks (from an average of ~93 in early January to 148 in the last two weeks of February). Since this is the first period of decision, there is no concluded history to adjust the lead time (promised L=4). I will use a conservative forecast based on the most recent 2-week demand spike (approx 148 units/week) to calculate mu_hat, rather than the lifetime average, to avoid understocking early on. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat target = 5 * 148 = 740. sigma_hat will be based on recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic long-sleeved jersey top, which is highly relevant for the February season. History shows a fairly stable demand over the last 5 weeks (102, 89, 87, 148, 148) and the most recent observation from Period 1 (82). The sudden increase to 148 in the two weeks prior might suggest a seasonal lift or promo, but Period 1 demand dropped back to 82. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 199 in-transit from the Period 1 order. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). I will use a recent window of 6 samples (including the live Period 1 data) to calculate demand. The 199 in-transit covers approximately 2 periods of recent average demand (~100/week), but since L=4, we need to ensure the pipeline covers L+1=5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) * mean demand - pipeline. I'll set L to default (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Looking at the historical demand (Jan: 102, 89, 87, 148; Feb: 148, 82, 138), there is a noticeable increase in demand starting late January/early February, likely corresponding to the seasonal transition as customers buy basic layering pieces like long-sleeved jersey tops. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in Period 3, orders from Period 1 and 2 haven't arrived yet (expected Period 5 and 6 respectively). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because we started with 0 inventory. To stabilize, I will use a 5-period window for demand forecasting (recent_N=5) to capture the higher recent mean (~120 units/week) compared to the full historical average. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a diversion.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). This SKU is a women's basic long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand data shows five samples before the game (102, 89, 87, 148, 148) and three periods during the game (82, 138, 106), indicating a mean demand of approximately 112.5 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, we have not yet reached the 'Arrival Resolution' phase for the first order (placed in Period 1). According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and becomes visible in Period 5's conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts (sold=0) because no arrivals have occurred yet. To manage this, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the total number of available demand samples) to capture the overall mean and variance. I will use the default lead time (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a drift.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, a staple item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory has been 0 for all periods, resulting in 100% lost sales despite consistent demand (average demand across P1-P4 is 96.5 units). This is because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (199 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Pipelines are currently full (563 units in transit: 199 from P1, 160 from P2, 176 from P3, 28 from P4). Total demand samples (including seed data) show a mean of ~114 units. Given the transition from winter to spring in March, demand for long-sleeved basics might remain steady or slightly decline, but the immediate priority is to maintain a base stock to stop lost sales once arrivals begin. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand seen during the actual game periods, which is slightly lower than the seed data, to avoid excessive holding costs once the 4-period lead time 'dam' breaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment of 199 units (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time. However, due to zero on-hand inventory from Periods 1-4, we missed significant demand (82, 138, 106, 60). The current on-hand inventory is 136, with 364 units in transit (expected arrivals in Periods 6, 7, and 8). Demand samples show high variability (82, 138, 106, 60, 63, plus the pre-game history: 102, 89, 87, 148, 148). The mean demand across all 10 available samples is approximately 102, while the standard deviation is approximately 32. Given the item is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' long-sleeved top and we are in mid-March, demand should remain relatively steady or slightly decline as weather warms, but we need to maintain a buffer to recover from the stockout phase. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture all relevant history and normalize the stock levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey basic. Current date is March 25. Historical demand analysis: initial samples (Jan/early Feb) were higher (avg ~115), but recent recorded demand (Periods 1-6) shows a stable lower regime (82, 138, 106, 60, 63, 64). The mean of the last 4 periods is 73.25, while the mean of the last 6 periods is 85.5. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to prioritize the latest stability. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 and the Period 2 order in Period 6. The current inventory state (232 on-hand + 216 in-transit) covers roughly 6 periods of recent demand (~450 total units). Setting N=6 for demand parameters to capture the post-initial-history behavior while maintaining some variance buffer for the earlier spikes in the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-11: Average demand stabilized at ~85 units/week compared to the pre-game history average of ~115. Lead time confirmed at promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-01. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, categorized as an everyday basic. Based on the historical demand since Period 1 (82, 138, 106, 60, 63, 64, 60), there was a shift around Period 4 where demand stabilized at a lower mean. The pre-game average was ~115, but the average of the last 4 periods is ~62. Period 5-7 shows very consistent demand (60-64 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (348 units) due to the arrival of early large orders (Periods 1-3) designed for the higher initial demand. With an expected (L+1) demand of ~310 units (5 periods * 62/week) and 348 units already on hand plus 40 in transit, we are overstocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~62) and high service level parameters to allow the backend to naturally pause ordering while the excess inventory clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 4 (2019-03-04): Mean demand decreased from ~110 to ~62 units/week (-44%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we have high on-hand inventory (315 units) relative to recent demand averages. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 4, dropping from a pre-game average of ~115 and an early-game average of ~85 to a very stable ~62 units per week over the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8: 60, 63, 64, 60, 61). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (arrived orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all showed L=4). With 315 units on hand and 12 in transit, the pipeline (327) covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~62 * 5 = 310), which is appropriate for L=4. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower, stable demand regime and default for L and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock levels without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~62 units/week over Periods 4-8, significantly lower than initial history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the demand for this 'Long-sleeved top' remains in a stable low-demand regime. Since Period 4 (early March), weekly demand has averaged 60.2 units (60, 63, 64, 60, 61, 50), which is significantly lower than the pre-game and early-game levels (~110+). This decrease aligns with the transition from winter into spring, reducing demand for long-sleeved jersey basics. Current inventory levels (265 units on-hand + 12 in-transit) are very high relative to this demand level, providing over 4.5 weeks of cover. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods. Since the current pipeline (277 units) already exceeds the required base stock for (L+1) periods (estimated at ~60 units/week * 5 periods = 300, minus the safety stock cushion already present in inventory), the OR backend will likely place zero or minimal orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this specific spring demand regime accurately.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory levels (243 on-hand, 22 in-transit) are significantly high relative to the detected demand regime. Over the last 7 periods (since Period 4), the mean demand has dropped to 56 units per week, with recent demand (Period 10) falling as low as 34 units. The product is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey,' which may be experiencing a seasonal decline as we move into late April. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the sustained lower demand since the regime shift in Period 4, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the current volatility. This will result in a lower base stock, preventing further accumulation of stock and minimizing holding costs while the backend OR engine digests the excess on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened: Periods 9 and 10 showed demand of 50 and 34, bringing the post-P4 average down from 62 to 56 units/week. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. Historical demand for this Jersey Basic long-sleeved top has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the initial pre-game samples. Since Period 4 (2019-03-04), demand has averaged approximately 54.1 units/week (60, 63, 64, 60, 61, 50, 34, 41), with a noticeable softening in the last 3 periods to ~41.6 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 202 units, which covers nearly 4-5 weeks of current demand. With 37 units in transit (ordered in Periods 10 and 11), the total pipeline inventory is 239. Given the base stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) for L=4 (covering 5 periods), and a profit-to-holding ratio of 1:1 (targeting a 50% service level, z=0), the target base stock is approximately 5 * 54 = 270 units. However, given the recent softening, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stable lower regime since Period 4, which helps prevent over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at a lower mean of ~54 units/week from Period 4 through Period 11, down from the initial pre-game average of 115 and the Period 1-3 average (~108).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. The product is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey.' Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand starting from Period 4 (early March), likely due to the seasonal transition from spring/winter to summer. Recent weekly demand (Periods 9-12) has averaged ~40 units, significantly lower than the ~62 units observed in the preceding regime. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to focus on the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to prevent overstocking of this seasonal item. I will use a recent_N method for demand (n=4) and lead time (n=4) to align with this current pattern. The high on-hand inventory (168 units) already covers roughly 4 weeks of demand, so the OR backend should naturally limit ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened starting Period 9 (2019-04-08): Average weekly demand decreased from ~62 to ~40 units (-35%), likely due to seasonality of long-sleeved items.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is experiencing a seasonal decline as we approach the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand has shifted significantly: from an initial ~108-115 units/week in February down to ~40 units/week recently (Periods 9-13: 50, 34, 41, 34, 43; Mean = 40.4). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10 arrivals all confirmed L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 125 and in-transit is 69, totaling 194 units. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~40, the required base stock is ~200 units. Since 194 is very close to 200, the inventory position is healthy. I will set mu_hat to the recent 5-period mean to reflect the current seasonal low, and use default calculation for L (which aligns with the observed 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~40 units/week (P9-P13) as seasonal demand for long-sleeved items continues to decline heading into summer.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, which is experiencing a seasonal decline in demand as the weather warms. Demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has averaged 41.5 units/week (50, 34, 41, 34, 43, 47), confirming the 'carry_over_insight' that the demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean compared to earlier in the spring. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (100 units) relative to recent demand, and a pipeline of 55 units (enough for nearly 4 weeks of demand), the OR backend needs to maintain a conservative base stock to minimize holding costs, which are equal to unit profit ($1.00). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this low-demand summer baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. The product is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is seasonally declining as summer approaches. Demand peaked in early spring and has stabilized at a lower level. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is approximately 44.5 units/week. While Period 15 saw a slight spike to 63, the overall trend since Period 9 remains significantly lower than the early-game average. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (consistently observed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P14, and P15). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend's base stock should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' given the high consistency, use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the seasonality-driven lower regime (averaging ~44.5 units/week), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current period's moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~45 units/week since Period 9 (2019-04-08), down from ~62 in the previous regime, reflecting summer seasonality for long-sleeved items. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which typically experiences lower demand as summer approaches. Demand has been stable around a lower mean since Period 9 (Apr 8). Over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), the demand mean is 44 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at a consistent 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 44 and in-transit at 123 (total 167), and expected weekly demand at 44, we have approximately 3.8 weeks of supply. Since L=4, the pipeline inventory is currently sufficient to cover the expected demand through the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods, requiring ~220 units). However, the OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the current pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period regime (N=8) to reflect the summer demand levels (approx 44 units * 5 weeks = 220), which will prompt the OR backend to place moderate orders to maintain the safety stock target for this lower demand period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Long-sleeved top) is exhibiting a seasonal demand shift as we move into summer (June). Demand in the last period (P17) dropped to 23 units, significantly below the P9-P16 average of ~45. The upcoming summer months are expected to keep demand low for long-sleeved items. Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Pipeline inventory is high at 176 units, with shipments of 8, 53, 62, and 53 units expected in Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21 respectively. The current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), considering the lower seasonal trend. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a lower level using the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture this downward trend (mean ~42), which will prevent over-ordering while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further as of Period 17 (2019-06-03): Demand dropped to 23 units, reflecting deepening summer seasonality for long-sleeved jersey tops. Recent 5-period average (P13-P17) is ~42 units/week, down from the P9-P13 average of ~45.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is experiencing lower demand as we head into summer (June). Period 18 saw demand drop to 16 units, following 23 units in Period 17, confirming a further softening of the demand regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 37.8 units, while the last 3 periods (P16-P18) average 26.3 units. Given the seasonality, I will use a conservative forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining enough stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With profit=1 and holding cost=1, the critical ratio q=0.5, meaning base_stock targets the median demand to minimize total costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further as of Period 18: Latest 3-period average (P16-P18) is ~26 units/week, down from the P13-P17 average of ~42, aligning with summer seasonality for long-sleeved items.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (316441001, Long-sleeved jersey top) is exhibiting a significant seasonal decline as it enters the peak summer season (June 24). Historical demand has dropped sharply from an average of ~45 to ~15 units over the last three weeks (23, 16, 5). The carrying-over insights confirm this softening regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by Period 14, 15, 16, and 19 concludes). Current inventory (On-hand: 61, In-transit: 134) is very high relative to this new demand level, especially given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00), which favors a cautious 0.5 service level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent seasonal drop and prevent further overstocking while waiting for existing in-transit units to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in sharp seasonal decline: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is ~15 units/week, down from ~45 in the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of summer (July). Demand has plummeted from ~45 units/week in late Spring to a very low average of ~6 units/week over the last two periods (P19-P20). With on-hand inventory at 117 units and an additional 72 units in-transit (ordered P17, P18), the current pipeline (189 units) is extremely excessive for the current demand regime. At 6-10 units/week, the current stock covers over 18 weeks of demand. We need to stop ordering immediately to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value of 35 (reflecting (1+L)*7 units) to ensure the base stock calculation stays well below our current inventory level, effectively halting new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~6 units/week (P19-P20), confirming deep summer trough for long-sleeved items.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the deep summer period (July 8). Demand has significantly dropped due to seasonality. The last three periods (P19-P21) show demand of 5, 6, and 18, respectively, averaging approximately 10 units/week. This remains much lower than the previous regimes. On-hand inventory is currently very high (152 units) relative to this low demand level, with an additional 19 units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high current inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period demand window (N=3) to reflect this seasonal trough and prevent further overstocking. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the height of summer (July 15). Demand has plummeted from a pre-game average of ~115 and a spring average of ~45 down to a recent 4-period average of ~12 units/week (P19-P22 demand: 5, 6, 18, 20). The slight uptick in the last two weeks (18, 20) may be a minor fluctuation or early indicators of demand stabilizing at a very low baseline, but overall inventory is extremely high (151 units on-hand) relative to current sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory covering over 12 weeks of current demand and the summer trough expected to continue for several more weeks, no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect this low-demand regime: L is set to 'default' (4), mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the summer shift, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the low but variable demand observed recently.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of summer (July 22). Demand has stayed low as expected for this seasonality, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 12.4 units per week. The system is currently overstocked with 138 units on-hand and zero units in-transit, which at current demand levels covers over 10 weeks of inventory. No shipments were expected to arrive in Period 23 as no orders were placed in Period 19. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low summer demand, I will use a very recent window (N=5) to reflect the current trough, which will cause the OR backend to continue placing zero orders until inventory levels normalize closer to the seasonal demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in deep summer trough for long-sleeved items (Average P19-P23: 12.4 units/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in its seasonal deep summer trough (late July). The demand regime has significantly softened, averaging approximately 13 units per week over the last 8 periods (P17-P24), with the most recent sample at 4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 134 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~13 units/week, represents over 10 weeks of stock. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and a profit of $1.0/unit, the optimal service level calculated by the OR backend (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) targets the median demand. With current stock levels significantly exceeding any reasonable base stock level (134 units on-hand vs. a total demand expectation over L+1 periods of roughly 65-75 units), no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (N=8) to reflect this low-demand summer regime, and keep lead time at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times remain consistent.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the deep summer seasonal trough (Northern Hemisphere). Recent demand (Periods 19-25) has consistently averaged 10.6 units/week, far below the initial pre-game average. Inventory is currently high (124 units on-hand), covering more than 10 weeks of current demand. With a holding cost equal to profit (Profit $1, Holding $1), the OR backend will prioritize minimizing inventory to avoid high holding costs during this low-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have a significant inventory surplus and demand is at a seasonal low, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the summer average (~10.6) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer trough (P19-P25): Average demand ~10.6 units/week. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved top) is currently in a deep summer demand trough, with demand appearing stable at a very low level. For Period 26, demand was 11, which aligns with the average of ~10.6 observed over the last 8 periods (P19-P26). On-hand inventory is currently 113 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At a demand rate of ~11 units/week, 113 units covers over 10 weeks of supply. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected demand over the lead time plus one period. With L=4, we need (1+L) * 11 = 55 units. Given we have 113 on-hand and 0 in-transit, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current low-demand regime and use default for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability while the overstock clears naturally.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved Jersey Top) is currently in a deep summer trough, with demand averaging approximately 10-12 units/week over the last 9 periods (P19-P27). As it is now late August (2019/8/19), we anticipate the start of a seasonal recovery as customers begin shopping for autumn/transition weather. Historically (P1-P3, Feb), demand was significantly higher (100+ units). Current on-hand inventory is 102 units, which covers about 8-10 weeks of the current low demand, or about 2-3 weeks if demand jumps back to pre-summer levels. Given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain sufficient stock for the transition. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the current trough while remaining sensitive to the low-demand regime, and keep sigma_hat default to account for potential volatility during the seasonal shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are reaching the end of the summer season for this long-sleeved jersey top. Historically, demand for such items begins to recover as the weather cools in late August and September. The recent data shows demand slightly ticking up (20 units in Period 28), although the average over the last 10 periods (P19-P28) remains low at approximately 11.8 units/week. Given the on-hand inventory of 82 units and the existing summer trough, no new orders are necessary yet. However, we must prepare for the autumn recovery. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (N=10) to reflect the low summer mean while allowing the backend to account for the current buffer. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods, which is applied via 'calculate'.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) has been 10, 11, 11, 20, 19, averaging 14.2 units/week. This suggests a slight recovery from the deep summer trough (where demand was <10) as we approach autumn, which typically sees increased demand for long-sleeved jersey tops. With 63 units on hand and 0 in transit, we have over 4 weeks of stock at current demand levels. Since lead time is 4 periods, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the trough and the recent slight uptick) to capture the trend of early seasonal recovery while avoiding over-ordering before the trend is fully solidified. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime showing early signs of seasonal recovery: Average demand increased to ~16.6 units/week over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) from the summer trough average of ~10.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 31 (2019-09-09). The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering its peak autumn/winter season. Historical demand from the start of the year (Feb/Mar) was significantly higher (~60-110 units) than the summer trough we just exited (~10 units). Over the last 4 weeks (P27-P30), demand has begun a steady recovery: 11, 20, 19, 17 (average ~17). Given the seasonal nature, I expect demand to continue climbing toward the ~60 units/week level seen in Spring. On-hand inventory is currently 46 units with 0 in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Periods 31-35. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the early recovery trend, but I will use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat with a higher value to ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to build stock for the upcoming seasonal surge, as 'recent_N' on sigma would be too low due to the stable summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from ~10 units/week (summer trough) to ~17 units/week over P27-P30. Expected to continue rising as autumn progresses for long-sleeved items.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey' is showing a clear seasonal recovery as we enter mid-September. Period 31 demand spiked to 41 units, a significant increase from the summer trough (avg ~10) and the early recovery phase (avg ~17). This aligns with expectations for autumn clothing. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 21.6 units/week, but the most recent observation of 41 indicates a rapid trend upward. Since the lead time is 4 periods and the product is a staple long-sleeved item, I am forecasting a mean demand of 45 units/week for the upcoming (L+1) window to ensure availability during this growth phase. Previous lead times have consistently been 4 periods; therefore, I will maintain L=4. Using recent_N=5 for sigma excludes the deep summer trough and captures the increasing volatility of the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery accelerating: Demand increased from summer average of ~10 to 41 units in Period 31 (2019-09-09). Demand regime shift confirmed from trough to growth phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved top, which is entering its peak seasonal recovery as we move into late September and autumn. Demand in Period 31 (41 units) and Period 32 (26 units) significantly exceeds the summer trough average (~10 units). In Period 32, we stocked out (ending on-hand=0, lost demand of 21 units), confirming that the seasonal upswing requires higher inventory levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high-growth demand and a stock-out, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 350 to cover (L+1=5) periods of demand, assuming a weekly mean of 70 (anticipating growth towards the early-year levels of ~85-110). sigma_hat is set to 80 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility observed during seasonal transitions. This aggressive stance aims to recover from the current stock-out and maintain service levels during the autumn climb.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery accelerating into autumn: Period 32 demand (including lost sales) reached 26 units with a stock-out, following a peak of 41 in Period 31. Current demand regime estimated at 40-70 units/week, up from summer trough of 10.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Long-sleeved top) is experiencing a rapid seasonal recovery as we enter October (Autumn). Period 33 demand spiked to 98 units, significantly exceeding the previous week's estimate and resulting in a total stock-out (0 on-hand). Although there are 221 units in-transit (ordered P31-P33), the first batch (28 units from P31) is not expected until Period 35 (L=4). To prevent prolonged lost sales during this high-growth phase, I am shifting to an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (98 units) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this new demand level across the lead time + review period (5 periods). Using 'recent_N' or 'default' would lag too far behind the current trend. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery accelerated sharply in Period 33 (2019-09-23) with demand hitting 98 units, confirming a return to (or exceeding) early-year demand levels (~100/week).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeved jersey top is in a sharp seasonal recovery as we enter October. Period 33 and 34 recorded demands of 98 and 93 respectively, following the autumn uptick. This confirms a return to the high-demand regime observed at the start of the year (approx. 100 units/week). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stock-outs while waiting for orders placed in Periods 31-34 (28, 64, 129, 161 units) to arrive. The first significant arrival (28 units from P31) is expected in Period 35's arrival phase (visible in P36 conclude), confirming the consistent 4-period lead time. To support this demand level and recover from the stock-out, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent two-week average of ~95 units/week. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat captures this specific high-demand peak, and I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during this transition. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at high autumn levels: Average demand for P33-P34 is 95.5 units/week, matching early-year peaks.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeved top has confirmed its seasonal recovery, stabilizing at a high autumn regime. Demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) was 98, 93, and 75, averaging approximately 89 units/week. This aligns with the 'high autumn levels' noted in the carry-over insights. Currently, the SKU is experiencing a stock-out (on-hand: 0) as seasonal demand outpaces recent arrivals, although a large pipeline (450 units) is in transit from orders placed in Periods 32-35. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P31 order arriving in P35. To navigate the growth phase and ensure high service levels (q=0.5 here since profit=1, holding=1, so q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5; OR will use the base stock as mean), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically. This will ensure the base stock levels are calculated based on the 85-95 units/week range rather than the annual average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high autumn levels: Average demand for P33-P35 is ~89 units/week, consistent with early-year performance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the high-demand autumn season (Oct 21). Historical demand has stabilized at a high level since Period 33, with recent demand samples of 98, 93, 75, and 77 (average ~86). Demand is consistently exceeding arrivals, leading to recurrent stock-outs (on-hand is currently 0). We are expecting the large order of 129 units from Period 33 to arrive during Period 37, but until then, inventory remains critical. To capture the current seasonal regime and ensure the base-stock calculation reflects the high autumn demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the summer trough. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top' has stabilized in a high autumn regime following the summer trough. Over the last five periods (P33-P37), demand has been 98, 93, 75, 77, and 79, averaging 84.4 units per week. This is consistent with early-year levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P33 order arrived in P37). On-hand inventory is 50, with 300 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, and P37). Given the current date (late October) and the product type (long-sleeved jersey), demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as winter approaches. I will use the recent 5 samples (P33-P37) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current 'high season' regime, which is significantly higher than the previous trough and growth phases. This ensures the base stock (covering 5 periods of demand) is sufficient to avoid stock-outs while reflecting the current seasonal mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn levels (P33-P37): Average demand ~84 units/week, significantly up from summer trough (~11) and growth phase (~30).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Long-sleeved top) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Since Period 33 (late September), demand has stabilized at high levels (P33-P38 average: ~85 units/week), consistent with the early-year performance (~82-138 range). The lead time remains highly reliable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38). With On-hand inventory at 121 and In-transit at 211, we have a total of 332 units to cover demand over the 5-period lead time cycle (L+1). Given current demand mean (~85), we expect total demand over the cycle to be ~425 units. The OR backend needs to maintain coverage. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering the stable autumn regime since Period 33) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this current high-demand state while accounting for moderate volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top' remains in its high autumn regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (P33-P39), average demand is 82.8 units per week. The last sample (P39: 68) is slightly lower than the previous four weeks (ranging 75-90), but this variation is typical for jersey basics. The pipeline is currently healthy with 210 units in transit and 149 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 35's order arriving in Period 39. I will continue to use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=7 to capture the full stabilized autumn regime while ignoring the previous summer trough and growth periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top' remains stabilized at high autumn/winter levels. The average demand from Period 33 through Period 40 is approximately 83.25 units per week, which is consistent with the established demand regime since late September. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, with arrivals for orders placed in Periods 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35 all concluding exactly at L=4. In Period 40, no units arrived because nothing was ordered in Period 36. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 266) is currently composed of orders from P37 (43), P38 (72), P39 (95), and P40 (56). Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (1+L=5 weeks). I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend responds to the current ~83 units/week average rather than the significantly lower summer trough data.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Long-sleeved top) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. From Period 33 to Period 41, demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 82 units per week (min 68, max 98). The most recent period (P41) saw demand of 71 units. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with the P37 order arriving exactly in P41. Inventory reconciliation: we have 35 units on hand and 311 units in transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). Since L=4, my parameters cover a 5-period window (L+1). With demand averaging ~82, we need approximately 410 units to cover the pipeline. Given 346 units total (oh + it), we are slightly under-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable autumn regime since P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn levels (P33-P41): Average demand ~82 units/week with standard deviation ~10. Lead time consistency at 4 periods reaffirmed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 spiked significantly to 182 units, more than double the stabilized autumn average (~82). This aligns with the start of the holiday shopping season (late November/early December). Recent demand (P33-P42) shows a mean of ~92 units, but the last period suggests a regime shift or a massive seasonal peak for women's basics. Despite the stock-out (ending on-hand: 0), 303 units are in-transit, with 95 units expected shortly (ordered P39). I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current autumn/winter volume, and using explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to account for the high volatility seen in the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed starting Period 42 (2019-11-25): Demand jumped to 182 units, suggesting a seasonal peak considerably higher than the stabilized autumn average (~82).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of high-volatility holiday demand. Period 42 saw a massive spike (182 units), while Period 43 dropped back to 42 units. This follows the pattern of 'Black Friday' spikes followed by a relative lull before a pre-Christmas surge. The target SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is highly relevant in December (winter). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44-P47), we need to ensure we don't stock out during the final Christmas rush but also avoid excess inventory at the very end. The average demand over the last 11 periods (since the autumn recovery in P33) is ~89 units. However, given the extreme 182-unit spike, 'default' or 'recent_N' might under- or over-react. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the high-regime mean (~89) and variance, but the OR backend's service level logic (profit check) will naturally set a high base stock to protect against spikes like the one seen in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (182 units), followed by a pullback in Period 43 (42 units). Calculated mean demand for the high-demand autumn/winter regime (P33-P43) is ~89 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (2019-12-16). The product is a seasonal long-sleeved jersey top. Recent history shows a significant holiday demand spike in Period 42 (182 units) followed by a return to normal autumn/winter levels (P43: 42, P44: 46). The average demand for the current high-demand regime (P33-P44) is approximately 84 units/week. As we approach the end of the game (47 periods total) and pass the peak holiday shopping season, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 63, and there is a significant pipeline of 328 units. To ensure coverage of the (L+1) period window without excessive over-ordering near the end of the simulation, I will set mu_hat based on the stable autumn/winter average (recent_N=12) and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility introduced by the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike peaked in Period 42 (182 units) and has since stabilized back to the autumn/winter baseline of ~45-85 units/week in Periods 43-44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-23 (Period 46). We are deep into the winter season for this long-sleeved top. Demand has stabilized after the late November/early December holiday peak (Period 42: 182 units). Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has averaged 48.6 units (42, 46, 58), which is significantly lower than the autumn baseline of ~82. This suggests a post-holiday cooling period. On-hand inventory is 93, and in-transit is 269, meaning pipeline inventory (362) is healthy relative to expected demand. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the recent drop from autumn levels (82 down to ~49), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture this lower post-peak demand regime while maintaining a standard volatility buffer. This will prevent over-ordering as we move past the winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening confirmed (P43-P45): Average demand decreased to ~49 units/week from the autumn/winter baseline of ~82.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top) has entered a post-holiday demand softening phase as confirmed in Period 46. Demand over the last four periods (P43-P46) has been 42, 46, 58, and 38 units, respectively, averaging ~46 units/week. This is a significant drop from the autumn/winter baseline of ~82 and the holiday spike of 182 in Period 42. Since it is now Dec 30 (Period 47), demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline or decrease further as winter inventory begins to clear. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 119 units on-hand and 205 in-transit (P43-P45 orders are still pending). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the post-holiday average (~46/week) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility to prevent over-ordering during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening confirmed (P43-P46): Average demand decreased to ~46 units/week from the autumn/winter baseline of ~82.
