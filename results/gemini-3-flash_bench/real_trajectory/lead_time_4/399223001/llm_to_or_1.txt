Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a staple denim item. There is no historical performance yet available in the 'conclude' messages, only the starting 5 weeks of demand history (avg \u2248 260.6). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. My strategy for Period 1 is to establish a baseline using all 5 historical samples to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 0, so the backend will place an initial order to fill the pipeline. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the most recent pre-start drift while using 'default' for L since no arrival data exists to adjust the promised estimate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a denim fashion item. Last period's demand (298) was consistent with the historical mean (~260-280). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because the order placed in Period 1 (308 units) is still in transit (promised lead time is 4). Based on the execution sequence, that shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. The historical demand samples (258, 233, 280, 234, 298) show a stable mean of approximately 260.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent baseline. I will set L to 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the (L+1) period window until units arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for 399223001 (Curvy Jeggings) has been consistent across the historical samples (avg ~261) and recent periods (P1: 298, P2: 272). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 631 units in transit (308 from P1, 323 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in P1 is not expected to arrive until P5. Since we have zero on-hand inventory, we have lost sales in P1 and P2. To cover future demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5 samples (mean ~263) and a lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1-period review plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods of demand coverage). I'll use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand variability while waiting for arrivals to bridge the stockout gap.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Curvy Jeggings HW Ankle' is a high-demand item with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect its arrival during the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales because demand occurred before any arrivals. The historical demand samples (258, 233, 280, 234, 298) and game history (298, 272, 199) show a mean demand of approximately 259. The recent drop to 199 in Period 3 might be a outlier or a slight cooling after a peak, but we should maintain a robust stock level to capture future sales once inventory arrives. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture recent mean demand (averaging roughly 255) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility. Lead time 'L' is kept at 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any completed delivery cycles to justify a change.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a denim staple. Historically (pre-game), demand was around 260. In the last 4 periods, demand was 298, 272, 199, and 177, showing a clear downward trend (avg ~236). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 (308 units) are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (this period). Because on-hand is currently 0 and we have 1283 units in-transit (P1-P4 orders), we are heavily reliant on the P1 order arriving now to satisfy demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the recent softening in demand while maintaining the default promised lead time (L=4) until arrivals confirm otherwise. The pipeline is currently full, so the OR backend will likely scale back the order volume to prevent overstocking once arrivals start hitting the shelves.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a staple denim item. Observed demand from the last five weeks (298, 272, 199, 177, 188) shows a clear downward shift after the first two weeks of February. The mean of the last three weeks is ~188, compared to an earlier average of ~260. The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 120, with 1087 units in transit. Given the lower recent demand, I will focus on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high initial spikes. This targets a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for sigma_hat also captures the lowered volatility in the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: average weekly demand decreased from ~260 to ~188 (-28%). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a denim staple for ladies. History from Period 3-6 shows a stable demand regime shift: demand has dropped from an early mean of ~265 to a current mean of approximately 191 (using last 4 periods: 199, 177, 188, 201). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). We have 242 units on hand and 764 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5 are expected to arrive in P7, P8, and P9 respectively). Given the consistent lower demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 191 average, matching the shift identified in Carry-over insights. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture current volatility. L remains default as the 4-period lead time is performing as expected.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product 'Curvy Jeggings' has shown a demand spike in Period 7 (343 units), significantly higher than the previous weeks' average (~188-201). This likely reflects a seasonal uptick as we enter spring (April). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory status: on-hand 219 and in-transit 444 (orders from P4 and P5). Since lead time L=4, we need to protect for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline of 444 includes P4 (332 units) and P5 (112 units). Given the recent demand surge to 343, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value (1100) to account for 5 periods of demand at a slightly higher forecasted average (~220/week) to capture spring seasonality. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in the transition from slow March to active April.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand uptick observed in Period 7 (343 units) as spring season begins in April.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', which is entering the spring peak. History shows a demand spike in Period 7 (343 units) and a moderate follow-up in Period 8 (237 units). Demand analysis: Pre-sample mean (Periods -4 to 2) was ~260. Period 3-6 mean was ~191. Period 7-8 mean is 290. The carry-over insight correctly identified the spring uptick. Pipeline status: On-hand (314) + In-transit (445) = 759 units. Orders from Period 5 (112), Period 8 (333), and any order from Period 6/7 (though history says ordered=0) make up the 'In-transit'. Specifically, the P5 order (112 units) is expected to arrive during this Period 9 (after decision) based on the consistent 4-period lead time observed for all concluded shipments. Parameters: L=4 (promised and confirmed). For mu_hat, the 'recent_N' method with N=2 (Periods 7-8) captures the current spring levels (avg 290 * (1+4) = 1450), which allows the OR backend to adjust to the higher seasonal demand while balancing the current high inventory (pipeline of 759). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=2 to reflect the high volatility (343 vs 237) seen during this seasonal transition.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 begins on 2019/4/15. Current on-hand is 267 with 747 in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across five consecutive arrivals (Periods 5-9). Demand history shows a shift: Periods 1-2 averaged ~285, followed by a lower regime in Periods 3-6 (~191), and extreme volatility in Periods 7-9 (343, 237, 159). The high demand in Period 7 (343) aligns with early April/spring seasonality for 'Curvy Jeggings', but the subsequent drop suggests this may have been a peak or that demand is stabilizing at a level higher than the March low but lower than the April peak. Given the holiday/seasonal context of mid-April, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the transition from March to the current April volatility (avg ~228 per week). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to account for the high standard deviation (approx 72) observed recently. These parameters ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while respecting the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lead time stability: confirmed at 4 periods for 5 consecutive shipments. High demand volatility in April: demand ranged from 159 to 343 units over the last 3 periods, requiring higher sigma_hat.

As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), we are in the middle of the spring season for Curvy Jeggings. Recent demand has shown high volatility (343 to 112 units), with a 10-period average of 218 units and a more recent 4-period average (post-Spring uptick) of 212 units. Period 10's significantly lower demand (112) suggests a cooling from the early April peak or high variance inherent in the category. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' qty (1090) includes orders from P8 (333), P9 (414), and P10 (343), but since P6/P7 had no orders, we are seeing the arrival gap now (arrived=0 in P10). P11 should see the arrival of 333 units ordered in P8. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat (N=8 covers since the demand drop in Period 3) to smooth the recent noise while respecting the lower baseline and spring variance. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (80) to account for the high standard deviation observed in the last few periods (range 112-343) and to prevent stockouts during the L=4 window.

Carry-over insight: High demand variance confirmed in April (Period 7-10 range: 112-343); average demand stabilized ~215 since Period 3 regime shift.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Examining the history, the promised lead time L=4 is strictly observed in all completed cycles (Periods 5-9). Period 10 and 11 correctly show 0 arrivals because the orders from Periods 6 and 7 were both 0, matching the lead time expectation. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but 1150 units are in transit, including orders from Periods 8 and 9 (333 and 414 units) expected to arrive in Periods 12 and 13 respectively. Demand analysis: Since the regime shift at Period 3, demand has been volatile, especially in April (ranging from 112 to 343). Period 11 demand was 178, and we sold out (155 available), indicating we are in a stockout position entering Period 12. Although demand has fluctuated, the mean since Period 3 is roughly 200. Given the high seasonality risk (End of April/Spring) and recent stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the Period 3 shift onwards) to set demand parameters, allowing the system to capture both the shifted mean and the heightened variance seen in recent weeks to ensure the safety stock covers the volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is Curvy Jeggings. Analysis of historical arrivals confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods (the last 6 arrivals all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand has entered a volatile phase in April/May ranging from 112 to 343. The average demand since Period 3 (when the first regime shift occurred) is approximately 200 units. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has been 112, 178, and 205, averaging 165. Given the seasonality of 'Ladies Denim' and 'Jeggings' in early May, demand typically stabilizes before potential summer shifts. Current on-hand is low (128), and although pipeline is high (898), Period 9 and 10 orders (totaling 757 units) are due in Period 13 and 14 respectively. Our objective is to cover (L+1) periods of demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the post-initial-drop regime which averages ~207, providing a conservative buffer against the recurring 300+ unit spikes seen in spring. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to account for the heightened volatility observed since late March.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product 'Curvy Jeggings' is in its post-spring season. Demand has stabilized but remains volatile. The recent 5-period demand average (Periods 9-13) is approximately 161 units (159, 112, 178, 205, 149), which is lower than the long-term average but consistent with the post-April trend. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods (orders from P8 and P9 arrived in P12 and P13 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory (393) and in-transit units (706: from P10, P11, P12, P13) total 1,099 units. This pipeline covers roughly 6.8 periods of current demand (1,099 / 161). To prevent overstocking as the spring peak subsides, I am using a recent window for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=7) to capture current demand levels and volatility, while keeping L at default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower mean (~160 units/week) in May following the April peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), the demand for Curvy Jeggings has stabilized at a lower level following the April peak. Over the last three weeks (P12-P14), demand has been 205, 149, and 172, averaging approximately 175 units. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 14 regarding a stabilized mean around 160-180 units in May. On-hand inventory is currently high (564 units) due to recent large arrivals from April orders. Combined with 363 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient responsiveness. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility compared to the high-variance April period. The OR backend will use these parameters to manage the high on-hand stock and likely reduce new orders to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean following the April peak, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) showing an average demand of 168.4 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P13-P15) show even lower demand (149, 172, 138), averaging 153 units. Product is Curvy Jeggings, which may see slightly reduced demand as the weather warms into late May/June compared to the early spring peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4), confirmed by the last 9 arrivals. On-hand inventory (486) + In-transit (321) = 807 units. To set parameters for Period 16, I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock from the recent high-variance period using recent_N=9 for sigma_hat (encompassing the volatile April/May transition). This balances the high service level requirement (95% critical ratio) against the current high on-hand levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the product 'Curvy Jeggings' has moved past the spring peak (April) and is showing a stabilized, lower demand mean in May through early June. The last four periods (Periods 13-16) show demand of 149, 172, 138, and 122 units, respectively. This gives a 4-period average of 145 units, which is a significant drop from the ~215 average observed in April. Lead time remains very stable at exactly 4 periods. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 445 units on-hand and 522 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower May/June stabilization, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the high-variance April period. I will stick with the 'calculate' method for Lead Time given its high historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in June (Periods 13-16): average weekly demand decreased to ~145 units (-33% from the April average shift), reflecting post-spring seasonality for denim leggings.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Reviewing recent demand history, a significant downward shift occurred starting in May (Period 13), stabilizing in June. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 137 units per week, which is a -33% drop from the previous April peak. Actual lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). Currently, there is high on-hand inventory (565 units) and 300 units in transit (expected arrivals in P19 and P21). Given the lower demand profile (L=4 implies a target period of 5 weeks, or roughly 685 units for base stock), the existing inventory and pipeline are sufficient. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower June demand regime and capture the current volatility while avoiding overstocking as we move further into the summer season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the item (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is in a low-demand regime following the spring peak. The historical demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) has been: 172, 138, 122, 102, 109, showing a clear stabilization at a lower mean compared to April. The average demand over these last 5 periods is approximately 128.6 units/week. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. With 456 units on-hand and 300 units in-transit (ordered in Period 16), the total pipeline of 756 units is significant relative to current demand (~128/week). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (promised 4) as there is no evidence of deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late June (P14-P18) with a mean of ~129 units, confirming a post-spring seasonal decline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). We are in a summer low-demand regime for denim jeggings. Carry-over insights and recent history show a consistent decline in demand since the April peak. Demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has been: 138, 122, 102, 109, 85, resulting in a mean of 111.2 units per week. The L+1 (5-period) forecasted mu_hat is 556. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 389 and in-transit is 282, totaling 671 units. Since total pipeline inventory (671) already exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (556) plus a safety buffer, the OR backend will likely minimize new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent decline while maintaining a small buffer for variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer lows (P15-P19): average weekly demand decreased further to ~111 units (-14% from late June average). High inventory relative to current low demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the peak summer period. Historically, demand for denim leggings has shown a consistent downward trend since the spring peak in April. The most recent demand (P20) was just 48 units, following a sequence of 102, 109, 85, and 48 (P17-P20). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 93 units, a significant decrease from earlier regimes. On-hand inventory is currently high (623 units), which is roughly 6-7 weeks of supply at current demand rates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the clear summer seasonal decline for this product category, the OR backend needs to avoid over-ordering. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime (~93 * 5 = 465) and maintaining a standard variance estimate. This will likely result in zero or very small orders until the inventory levels align with the seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer lows (P16-P20): average weekly demand decreased to ~93 units, confirming a deep seasonal trough for denim leggings.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Curvy Jeggings) is experiencing a deep seasonal trough during the summer (July), with recent demand (P17-P21) averaging 91 units/week. This follows a clear downward trend from April's peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P12, P13, P15, and P16 arrived exactly at L=4; the gap in P18 and P21 is due to no orders being placed in P14 or P17). Current on-hand inventory (512) is extremely high relative to current demand, representing over 5 weeks of stock at the current rate (91 * 5 = 455). To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the summer demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to minimize orders until the inventory levels normalize.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (mid-July). Demand for denim jeggings is in a seasonal trough. Historically, demand from Period 17 to 22 has been significantly lower than spring levels, though Period 22 saw a slight uptick to 146 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is roughly 100 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 366 units, which is approximately 3.6 weeks of cover at current sales rates. With 49 units in-transit (due around Period 24), our total pipeline is 415 units. Given that (L+1) = 5, the base stock targets should be calibrated to this lower summer regime to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand behavior and keep L at default as lead times remain stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer lows (P18-P22): average weekly demand ~100 units. Slight uptick in P22 (146 units) needs monitoring but overall trend remains low compared to spring peaks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in a summer trough for denim leggings, with recent demand (P19-P23) averaging 107 units per week, despite a slight uptick to 146 in the last two periods. On-hand inventory is 220 and in-transit is 209 (Total=429). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). However, current total inventory (429) already covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the recent mean. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the subtle uptick while acknowledging the summer low, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen throughout late spring and summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in summer (P19-P23) with a mean of ~107 units, showing high volatility (85 to 146 range).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a summer seasonal low for the 'Curvy Jeggings' product. Analysis of recent demand (Period 20-24) shows values of 48, 111, 146, 146, and 60. This reflects a low-volume but highly volatile regime (mean ~102, std ~44). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P20 order arrived P24). With on-hand inventory at 209 and in-transit at 326 (total 535) against a 5-period demand window (L+1), the current pipeline is healthy relative to the summer mean. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current summer trough while acknowledging the volatility. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance observed over the last five weeks to prevent stockouts if demand spikes again like in P22-23.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand for these jeggings shows a clear seasonal patterns: a spring peak in April followed by a steady decline through the summer (July/August). In the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the demand has averaged approximately 115 units/week (range: 60-146). The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 97 and a substantial pipeline of 473 units (from orders in P23, P24, and P25), our total coverage is 570 units. At current demand rates, this covers nearly 5 weeks of demand, aligning well with the L+1 (5 period) requirement. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-summer stabilized demand regime and avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late summer (P21-P25) with a mean of ~115 units, following the summer trough; inventory pipeline is currently sufficient to cover expected lead-time demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (August 12), we are entering the mid-to-late August retail period. Demand in Period 26 spiked to 182 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (~107), signaling a transition out of the summer trough and potentially into the back-to-school or early autumn demand phase for denim jeggings. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 26. Pipeline inventory is 608 units, but no arrivals occurred in the last two periods. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods, which implies the orders from Period 23 (160 units) should arrive during this Period 27. To address the demand spike and replenish the stockout, I am increasing \u03bc\u0302 using a recent_N of 5 periods (which captures the recent upward trend including the 182-unit peak) while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 60 to 182 units). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 26 (182 units), signaling an exit from the summer trough and potential start of an autumn/back-to-school demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 (mid-August). The demand has clearly shifted from the summer trough (Period 21-25 average ~115) to a higher autumn/back-to-school regime. Period 26 demand was 182 and Period 27 was 193. This represents a ~60% increase over the summer baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 653 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 24 (166 units), 25 (147 units), and 26 (135 units) over the next three periods. To avoid stockouts during this autumn uptick, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 samples (N=2) to capture the new average of ~188 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to the recent_N (N=5) to account for the increasing volatility observed during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed: Period 26-27 average demand is 187.5 units, up from the summer average of ~115 (+63%). This likely marks the start of back-to-school/fall seasonality for denim jeggings.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). Demand has clearly shifted into an autumn/back-to-school regime. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand of 182, 193, and 200, respectively, indicating a sustained upward trend from the summer low (~115). Period 28 saw 200 units of demand despite a stockout, confirming a mean shift to approximately 190-200 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (764 units) is primarily composed of orders placed during shorter/lower demand periods. To protect against lost sales during this growth phase, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 periods (P26-P28) to capture the new mean (~192) and set sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility. This will ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: P26-P28 demand (182, 193, 200) shows a sustained increase to a mean of ~192 units, up from the summer mean of ~115.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September). The 'Autumn/Back-to-school' regime identified in Period 26-28 (demand mean ~192) has softened slightly with Period 29 demand at 137. However, historical samples from early 2019 (January/February) showed demand levels in the 230-290 range. As we move further into the autumn season for denim jeggings, demand is expected to remain robust. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 178 units. Given the inventory context (On-hand: 10, In-transit: 824), our pipeline is significant. While lead time remains stable at 4 periods, we must ensure the backend covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a 4-period window to capture the recent autumn shift while smoothing the recent P29 dip. Sigma_hat will also be set based on this recent high-volatility window to ensure a sufficient service level during regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime refined: Period 26-29 mean demand is 178 units, significantly higher than summer lows (~100-115), despite single-period dip in Period 29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned into a clear Autumn/Back-to-school regime. In Period 30, demand hit 225, confirming the uptrend mentioned in previous insights. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 187 units (182, 193, 200, 137, 225), which is a significant increase from the summer mean of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P26 order arrived in P30). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (850 units) is serving a demand that is both high and volatile. To ensure the OR backend captures this new mean and the associated volatility, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5), covering the start of the Autumn shift through the most recent peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Period 26-30 mean demand is ~187 units, a 70% increase over summer lows. High volatility remains present (137 to 225 range).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for denim jeggings has entered a significantly higher autumn/back-to-school regime. In Period 31, demand reached 328 units, the highest since Period 7, continuing a clear upward trend from the summer trough. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31: 182, 193, 200, 137, 225, 328) is ~211 units, but the most recent two weeks (P30-P31) average 276 units, suggesting momentum. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 851 units in-transit. To avoid further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent 6-period window to capture the upward autumn shift while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the recent weeks (ranging from 137 to 328).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Period 31 demand (328 units) represents the highest volume since the spring peak; average demand for the last 2 periods is ~276, significantly exceeding the early autumn average of ~180. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September autumn peak (Back-to-School/Fall transition). Period 32 demand reached 356 units, continuing a significant upward trend from 328 in Period 31. The autumn regime (P26-P32) shows a clear shift with a mean of 231.5 units and high volatility. Specifically, the last two periods (P31-P32) average 342 units. Given the seasonality of Curvy Jeggings, this peak likely represents the peak of autumn demand before stabilizing. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 896 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high demand volatility and growth, I will use a recent N=7 for mu_hat (covering the autumn regime) and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the recent high variance. Using N=7 for mu_hat yields a base forecast of ~232 units per week, while N=2 for the last two weeks would be ~342. To be safe given the stockouts in the last 3 periods, I will explicitly set mu_hat closer to the most recent elevated mean to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 31-32 average demand is 342 units, a 48% increase over the early autumn average (P26-P30: ~180). Strong stockout pressure requires higher base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3933.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn peak for 'Curvy Jeggings'. Demand over the last three periods has risen from 328 to 356 and now 401, a 22% increase in the last period alone. This confirms the autumn peak shift noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 33). On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite the arrival of 207 units from Period 29, as demand (401) significantly outpaced supply. The pipeline inventory (1053 units) includes orders from Period 30 (161), 31 (206), 32 (322), and 33 (364). My target is to cover (L+Review) = 5 periods of demand. Given the sharp upward trend, a mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~362) represents the current regime better than longer-term averages. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks of growth.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand growth: Period 31-33 mean demand is 362 units, a 100% increase over the early autumn mean (~180). Stockout conditions persist despite increased ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a strong autumn/back-to-school demand regime for denim jeggings. Current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand over the last 4 periods (P31-P34) has been exceptionally high: 328, 356, 401, and 284 units respectively (mean = 342.25). Despite the slight dip in P34, the trend remains significantly elevated compared to the early autumn mean of ~180. On-hand inventory is 0, indicating a stockout at the start of Period 35. The pipeline (in-transit) is 1430 units, with 206 units expected to arrive during Period 35 (ordered P31, L=4). However, with demand running near 350+ units, we are still under-inventoried relative to the lead-time demand of ~(1+4)*350 = 1750 units. I will use the last 4 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and protect against further stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high autumn demand (P31-P34): Mean demand has increased to ~342 units, a ~90% increase over the \ucd08\uae30 autumn mean of ~180. Stockouts persist.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a sustained high autumn demand regime for SKU 399223001 (Curvy Jeggings), which correlates with back-to-school and fall seasonality. Since Period 31, demand has surged significantly, with samples of 328, 356, 401, 284, and 262 (Mean \u2248 326). Although the last two periods show a slight cooling from the extreme peak (401), demand remains substantially higher than the early autumn average (~180). Stockouts have been persistent (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for 6 of the last 7 periods), indicating that the pipeline is struggling to catch up. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. To address the stockout risk while acknowledging the slight recent dip, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume autumn regime (roughly 326 units/week). This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) during this peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) is in an autumn demand peak, characterized by high volatility and consistent stockouts. Current date is Oct 21, moving further into the fall/winter denim season. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has fluctuated significantly: 328, 356, 401, 284, 262, and 322 (Mean \u2248 325). While demand dropped slightly in P34-P35, P36 showed a return to the mean (~322). Stockouts occurred in every period from P26 to P36 except P29, meaning TRUE demand is likely higher than sold units and even slightly higher than observed demand due to lost sales impact on the supply chain ecosystem. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods; 5 * 325 = 1625). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility observed in this peak (range 262-401). Pipeline is 1514 against an expected lead-time demand of ~1625, justifying continued aggressive ordering to prevent further stockouts as we enter late October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed (P31-P36): demand has stabilized at a high mean of ~325 units/week with persistent stockout pressure. Evidence: 6-period mean of 325.5 vs previous early-autumn mean of 180.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6916.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the Curvy Jeggings are in a sustained autumn peak regime. The demand average for the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 331 units per week (328, 356, 401, 284, 262, 322, 367), despite significant stockouts in almost every period due to on-hand inventory being exhausted by demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (1447 units) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, the target base stock must reflect the current high mean and high volatility of this autumn peak. Using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat captures this specific regime effectively while sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility (range 262 to 401).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5222.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39 (early November). Recent demand (Periods 31-38) has fluctuated between 262 and 401, with a mean of ~326 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 288, slightly below the peak but still within the high autumn plateau. After several periods of stockouts, the arrival of 538 units from P34 has finally provided an on-hand cushion of 250 units. The pipeline is very full (1297 units), covering approximately 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given we are approaching mid-November, we should monitor for a potential late-season taper, but for now, the 'autumn peak plateau' remains the most reliable regime (N=8 includes the start of the leap in P31). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this specific high-demand plateau for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain high service levels while respecting the large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-November period (2019/11/11). Historical demand data suggests the product (Curvy Jeggings) experienced a significant autumn peak between Periods 31 and 37, where weekly demand averaged ~325 units. Since Period 38, demand has slightly moderated, with the last two periods recording 288 and 245 units (mean ~266). This likely indicates we have passed the absolute peak of the autumn/back-to-school season but remain in a high-demand regime relative to summer. Inventory is currently healthy: 429 units on-hand and 1130 in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the slight downward shift from the peak while maintaining sufficient stock for the remaining autumn/winter demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to account for the volatility seen throughout the high-demand autumn cycle (ranging from 245 to 401).

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated post-autumn peak (P38-P39 mean ~266), trending lower than the peak plateau of ~325. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are exiting the peak autumn demand period (which saw a mean of ~325 units/week) and entering a moderation phase. Demand for the last three concluded periods (P38-P40) has been 288, 245, and 216 units, averaging ~250 units. This suggests a tapering off as we move toward winter. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (401) and in-transit (1058) are high, intended to cover the previous peak but now potentially exceeding the moderated demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_3 to capture this downward trend (mean ~250), helping the OR backend adjust base stock levels downward to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for high-profit margins ($19). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand moderation confirmed (P38-P40): average weekly demand decreased to ~250 units from the peak plateau of ~325 (-23%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a post-autumn demand moderation phase for jeans/jeggings. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P38-P41: 288, 245, 216, 241) to a mean of approximately 247.5 units, down from the peak plateau of ~325 units. This matches the 'Post-autumn demand moderation' insight. Inventory levels are currently healthy (On-hand: 457, In-transit: 761), totaling 1218 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains very stable at exactly 4 periods. Since we have seen 4 consecutive periods of stable demand around the 240-250 range, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new regime while maintaining a buffer for the remaining 6 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand stabilization confirmed (P38-P41): average weekly demand is approximately 248 units (-24% from peak plateau).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). After a sustained autumn peak of ~325 units/week (P31-P37), demand moderated to a stable level of approximately 248 units/week between Periods 38 and 41. However, Period 42 saw a significant demand surge to 447 units. This likely represents 'Black Friday' or 'Cyber Monday' promotional activity, typical for early December in retail. While this spike is sharp, it is likely a transient seasonal event rather than a permanent regime shift to a higher mean. To balance inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the stable post-autumn mean (N=5: P38-P42, excludes the extreme peak but includes the moderation) to avoid overreacting to the single-period spike, while using an explicit sigma_hat to account for this seasonal volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently 503 units with 398 on-hand, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 weeks of moderate demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand spike observed in Period 42 (447 units), likely seasonal promotional activity (Black Friday). Previous stable post-peak mean was ~248 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2425.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (447 units) confirmed a Black Friday/early December spike. However, Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 154 units, suggesting the promotional peak has passed or we are between holiday peaks. We are now heading into mid-December (2019/12/9). Historically, for 'Curvy Jeggings', we expect a pre-Christmas lull or stabilization before any late-season clearance. The current on-hand (501) and in-transit (615) total 1,116 units, which is high relative to the post-spike demand. I will use a recent demand window (N=6, covering the Black Friday spike and the subsequent drop) to calculate mu_hat, balancing the extreme 447 and the 154. This averages to approximately 242 units/week, which is consistent with the pre-spike stabilization mean (~248). Sigma_hat will be set using the same window to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (range 154-447). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand drop observed in Period 43 (154 units) following the Period 42 spike (447 units), suggesting a return to the pre-holiday mean of approximately 240-250 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3663.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned from the late November/early December holiday peak (Period 42: 447 units) back toward its post-autumn mean of approximately 215-250 units (Period 43-44: 154 and 214 units). Given the date is December 16, we are entering the mid-December period where demand often stabilizes or slightly softens before potential end-of-year activity. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods based on the last 30+ arrivals. With 403 units on-hand and 928 units in-transit (covering multiple previous high-volume orders), the pipeline is healthy. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture the trend since the start of November, which averages approximately 243 units per period. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect recent volatility including the Black Friday spike, ensuring the backend maintains an appropriate safety stock for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Period 43-44 demand (avg 184) confirms an exit from the late-November peak, returning toward the late-autumn baseline of ~240 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46). Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at a mean of approximately 210 units (Periods 43-45 mean is 208.6). The period 42 spike (447) was an outlier related to holiday promotions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals from P34-P40. Pipeline inventory (1228) plus on-hand (145) is 1373, which is significantly high relative to the (L+1)=5 week lead-time demand (5 * 210 = 1050), suggesting we have sufficient stock for the short term. For OR parameters, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat of 8 periods (P38-P45) to capture the post-autumn peak stabilization (~234 units) while smoothing out the Black Friday volatility. L is set to 'calculate' given the long history of stable 4-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization (P43-P45): Mean demand has stabilized at ~210 units, returning to post-autumn levels after the Black Friday spike of Period 42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3585.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 coincides with late December (2019/12/30). Historically, demand for this SKU surged in early spring (April) and autumn (September-October), with a localized spike in late November (Black Friday). Current demand (P43-P46: 154, 214, 258, 193) shows a normalized mean of ~205 units, consistent with the post-autumn/post-holiday stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. A potential lead time issue is noted: the order from Period 41 (0 units, but still a tracked placement event in certain logic) and more importantly, the order from Period 43 (369 units) should arrive in Period 47. Since the Period 46 conclude showed the P42 order arriving correctly at L=4, lead time remains stable. On-hand inventory is 82, with 1331 units in transit (including large orders from Periods 43, 44, and 45). Given the proximity to the January/February historical data (samples 233-298), I expect demand to rise slightly in the coming weeks. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the post-holiday normalization for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure responsiveness to the recent volatility (range 154-258).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization (P43-P46): Demand mean has stabilized at ~205 units after the Period 42 Black Friday spike, aligning with early 2019 historical baseline.
