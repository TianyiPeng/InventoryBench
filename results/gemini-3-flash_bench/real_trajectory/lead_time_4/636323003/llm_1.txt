Historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85 over the last 5 weeks (~42% average weekly growth). This buildup aligns with early spring fashion seasonality as the date moves into mid-February. I anticipate demand continuing to rise or stabilizing at a high level (est. 90-110 units). Promised lead time is 4 periods. With L=4, I must cover demand for the current period plus the 4 periods until the order arrives (P1 to P5). Total periods to cover: 5. Forecasted demand for P1-P5: P1(90) + P2(100) + P3(110) + P4(115) + P5(115) = 530 units. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0.

March and April typically see higher demand for 'Ankle-length' jeans as spring weather arrives in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the actual game periods, demand jumped to 67 in P1 (Feb 11) and surged to 173 in P2 (Feb 18).

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Ladies Denim Skinny Ankle-length jeans'. We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), moving deep into the winter season. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in early autumn (Aug-Sept, ~120 units) followed by a steady decline. Recent demand patterns (P39-P43) have stabilized around 40-50 units, with a temporary spike in P42 (85 units) attributed to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activity. The subsequent P43 demand (47 units) confirms a return to the lower winter baseline. With an on-hand inventory of 212 units and demand expected to remain around 40-50 units per period, the current stock provides coverage for 4-5 periods, which matches the lead time of 4. Given that we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 47) and holding costs are relatively high ($1.00) compared to profit ($4.00), I will avoid new orders to minimize ending inventory and maximize profit from current stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Black Friday demand (P43: 47 units) confirms a return to the winter baseline regime of ~40-50 units after the seasonal autumn peak and holiday spikes.",

  "rationale": "The SKU '636323003' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a low-demand winter regime following its seasonal autumn peak. Period 44 demand was 29 units, continuing the downward trend from the winter baseline established in early November (~40 units). The date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45), with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive at the start of Period 50 (P45 + 4 lead + 1 delay = P50), which is after the game ends. Therefore, ordering more stock is counterproductive as it would only increase holding costs without any opportunity for additional sales. On-hand inventory is 183 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (estimated at ~30-40 units per period, totaling ~120 units). No further orders are required.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a ladies' skinny high-waist denim ankle jean. Historical data shows two major demand peaks: a spring peak (Feb-March) and a late-summer/autumn back-to-school peak (July-Sept). Currently, we are in late December (Period 46). Demand has stabilized at a low winter regime, with the last two periods (P44-P45) averaging 27.5 units, down from the minor holiday boost in late November. World knowledge suggests that after the Christmas/Boxing Day period, retail demand for apparel often transitions into a pre-spring clearance or a slow January before the spring refresh. Given that on-hand inventory is 157 units and current demand is ~27 units/week, the current stock covers approximately 5.8 weeks of demand. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 50. Since inventory is sufficient to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods) at current consumption rates (5 * 27 = 135 < 157) and we want to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit) during the low-demand January period, no new order is necessary. We will monitor for the start of the spring demand surge, which historically began in early February (Period 1 in the previous cycle).",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a ladies' denim trouser, which exhibits strong seasonal patterns. Currently, for the Period 47 decision (dated Dec 30, 2019), we are in a deep winter regime. Historically, demand for this SKU dropped significantly in December, with recent demand falling from 29 (P44) to 26 (P45) and finally 13 (P46). The 3-period average is approximately 22.6 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 (late January/early February). Looking at the early history from Feb 2019, demand was initially around 50-70 units before surging into the spring peak. On-hand inventory is currently 144 units with zero in-transit. At the current low-demand rate (~20 units/period), the 144 units on hand are sufficient to cover at least 6-7 periods of demand, which safely spans the lead time plus several weeks into the potential spring recovery. Ordering now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit) for a product with a relatively low profit margin ($4/unit), especially as winter demand is at its floor. Therefore, the optimal strategy for this period is to maintain zero new orders and deplete the current stock.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Winter demand floor confirmed at the end of December (P46 demand: 13 units), completing the seasonal cycle from the autumn peak. Starting on-hand inventory of 144 units allows for a 6+ week runway at current consumption levels.",
