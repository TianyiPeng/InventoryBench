Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 679853001 (Knitwear/Sweater). Historical demand from the previous 5 weeks shows an increasing trend (69 to 126) followed by a slight dip to 92. The average demand per period is approximately 101.8. Given it is mid-February, we are still in the sweater season, but might see a gradual decline as Spring approaches. The promised lead time is 4 periods. With on-hand and in-transit inventory at 0, we need to establish a baseline order. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat to utilize all available history for stability, but use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand levels compared to the very beginning of the history. This will set a base stock level roughly covering (4+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic soft knit sweater. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend in January (69, 89, 133, 126, 92) with an average of 101.8. In Period 1, demand was 45, which is lower than the January average but aligns with a post-winter-clearance lull. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (147 units) is still in transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we have no completed lead-time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 (the 5 historical samples + the Period 1 observation) to capture the recent mean of 92.33. This results in mu_hat being (1+4)*92.33 = 461.65, accounting for the lead time and current period demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for periods 1 and 2 was 45 and 46 units respectively, which is lower than the initial historical samples from January (average 101.8). The product is a basic sweater from H&M's 'Divided' collection. As we move from February into March, demand for knitwear typically begins to soften as spring approaches. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant amount (295 units) in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. Following the lead-time timeline: the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 (conclude P5, visible P6). Since P1 and P2 concluded with 0 arrivals, this is consistent with L=4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to better capture the recent downward shift from the January peak, while keeping L at the promised default of 4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is a 'soft knit jumper', which is a transition/spring season item. Examining the history, we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 305 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, order arrivals from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) are not expected to be visible in 'conclude' messages until the start of Period 6 (arriving during Period 5). Thus, observing 0 arrivals so far is perfectly consistent with the 4-period lead time. Demand has averaged 58.6 over the 8 available data points (5 historical + 3 game history), though recent game history shows a slight dip (45, 46, 25). Given the product type, demand should remain steady or slightly decline as we move away from winter. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 72.8 units/period including the last historical samples) to ensure we cover the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. L remains at the promised 4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' sweater. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) showed a mean of ~101, but the last four periods show a significant drop (45, 46, 25, 24), suggesting a seasonal transition out of peak winter knitwear demand. No units have been sold yet because on-hand inventory remains 0; orders have not arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (147 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (arrived = 147 should appear in the Period 5 conclude message seen at Period 6). Current pipeline inventory is 334 units. Given the recent demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to adjust to the lower demand regime (avg ~35) while maintaining the default lead time for now. This will help prevent over-ordering as we await the first arrival.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since then, we have established on-hand inventory (114 units) and have 187 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand samples [69, 89, 133, 126, 92] and recent game performance [45, 46, 25, 24, 33] show a downward trend or stabilization compared to January. The average demand across these 10 samples is roughly 68.2. With a lead time of 4 periods, (L+1) is 5. Using recent_N=5 for demand to capture the recent lower volume (average ~34.6 per period) while maintaining a buffer. Sigma is set to default to handle the earlier volatility seen in January until more consistent local variance is established.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a soft knit jumper from the Divided collection. Demand history shows a significant drop from January levels (avg ~100) to current levels (avg ~30 since mid-February). This suggests the peak season for this specific knitwear item is passing. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals matched P1 and P2 orders). On-hand inventory is currently high (234) due to large orders placed in P1 and P2 arriving, while demand has remained low. Pipeline inventory consists of 39 units (orders from P3 and P4). Given the current holding cost equals profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalized as understocking. I will use the last 5 samples to represent the current lower-demand regime (avg ~31) and trust the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after 2019-02-04: Average weekly demand dropped from ~100 to ~30 (-70%), likely due to seasonal transition out of peak knitwear weather.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a knitwear sweater, which is transitioning into a low-demand season as spring begins. Previous carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift after the initial sample data: demand has dropped from an average of ~100 to ~29 over the last 7 periods (45, 46, 25, 24, 33, 28, 13). Specifically, the last 3 periods (Periods 5-7) show a further decline to an average of ~25. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is currently high (231 units) due to the arrival of large initial orders, while only 29 units remain in-transit (expected in Period 8 conclude). Given the low demand and high holding cost (equal to unit profit), we need to avoid further accumulation. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (the 'post-peak' regime) to align the base stock with current reality, using N=7 for mu and sigma to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a knitwear sweater (SKU 679853001), which has shown a clear decline in demand as we move deeper into spring. As noted in the carry-over insights, the demand regime shifted from an average of ~100 units/week to ~28.6 units/week over the last 8 periods (last 4 periods: 33, 28, 13, 25). Current on-hand inventory is 235 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage), our current stock level of 235 units is sufficient to cover approximately 8.2 periods of demand (235 / 28.6), which is far beyond the 5-period requirement. This high inventory relative to demand will result in significant holding costs if we order more. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to capture the lower spring demand levels accurately. The OR backend will see that on-hand (235) is greater than the calculated base_stock, resulting in an order of 0 units, which is appropriate to bleed off excess inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019-04-15). The item is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' knitwear jumper. Historical data from early 2019 showed demand around 100 units/week, but since early February, demand has dropped significantly. Since Period 1, the average demand is approximately 25.6 units/week (total demand 231 over 9 periods). Recent performance from Period 5 onwards (when stock became available) shows an even lower average of ~20 units/week. As we are moving further into spring/summer, demand for knitwear is expected to remain low or continue to decline. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by 4 consecutive arrivals (P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 223 units with 0 in-transit. With a weekly demand of ~20-25 units, the current stock covers approximately 9-11 weeks of demand, which far exceeds the L+1 (5 weeks) requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (N=9, covering the game history) and L to default to the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' knitwear jumper. Historical demand shows a significant drop from an average of ~101 (pre-regime shift) to ~22 (Periods 1-10). The last three periods (Periods 8-10) alone averaged only 13 units. As we move further into spring, demand for heavy knitwear continues to decline, evidenced by the demand of only 3 units in Period 10. We have 220 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and demand is very low/declining, our current inventory covers us for approximately 10-15+ periods. No new orders have been placed recently, and none are needed. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the low-demand spring regime (averaging ~13 units/period) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on the high initial samples (69-133 range). L is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the low-volume post-winter regime; last 3 weeks average <15 units/period compared to pre-Feb average of ~100.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a sweater (knitwear), which is in its low-demand season as spring transitions into summer. Historical demand has plummeted from ~100 units/period in January to an average of 18.2 units/period since the regime shift in Period 1 (post Feb 4th), and even lower recently, averaging just 6.6 units over the last 5 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 215 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current low demand, 215 units are more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future. My goal is to prevent any additional ordering to avoid incurring unnecessary holding costs for this seasonal item. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current very low demand regime (avg ~6.7/period). This will keep the base stock level well below the current on-hand inventory + pipeline level, triggering zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-winter low demand regime further solidified: last 5 weeks demand (Periods 7-11) average 11.6 units, while last 3 weeks average only 6.7 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 is a knitwear jumper, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in May (Period 13), well past the peak winter/early spring demand. Historical data for the last 6 periods show a very low and stable demand regime (13, 25, 12, 3, 5, 10). The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) is 11 units. Our current on-hand inventory is 205 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods (approx. 55 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which yields a service level target of 50%, we are currently overstocked. No new orders are needed. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods in all observed arrivals. For the OR parameters, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the low post-winter demand specifically, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility of this regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. The product is a soft knit jumper, which is highly seasonal and currently in a low-demand phase following the winter/early spring peak. Demand has significantly decelerated: the average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) is only 8 units per week, compared to the initial samples which averaged ~100. We currently have 195 units on-hand, which at the current consumption rate is over 24 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalized. We have no in-transit inventory, and given the massive overstock, we do not want to place any new orders. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised. I will set the lead time to default and adjust mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the last 5 periods (N=5) to prevent the OR backend from seeing the earlier high-demand samples and ordering more.

Carry-over insight: Post-winter low demand regime further solidified: average demand for last 5 completed periods (P9-P13) is 8.0 units per period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The product is a knitwear jumper, a category experiencing very low seasonal demand. Demand in the last 5 completed periods (P10-P14) has been minimal (3, 5, 10, 10, 1 units respectively), averaging 5.8 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 194 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (L+1=5), and the current demand rate, we have enough stock to cover over 30 periods. Our objective is to minimize holding costs while demand is low. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more stock, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low demand regime, ensuring the base stock level remains significantly below our current 194 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear Jumper) is in a deep post-winter seasonal slump. Current date is late May (2019/5/27), and demand has consistently dropped as temperatures rise. For the last 5 periods (P11-P15), actual demand was [5, 10, 10, 1, 9], averaging 7.0 units per period. Meanwhile, we have 185 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should hold only about (L+1) * mean demand. With a promised lead time of 4, our targets should roughly equate to 5 * 7 = 35 units. Our current inventory (185) is significantly higher than required. Therefore, I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=5) to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders while we liquidiate the excess on-hand stock. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, and the product (a soft knit jumper) is in a clear summer off-season demand regime. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), demand has averaged 8.2 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 6.8 units. The on-hand inventory of 181 units is extremely high relative to this demand (covering over 20 weeks of sales), resulting in significant holding costs. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in P5-P8), so L is set to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the low-demand post-winter regime while smoothing out the noise from very low weekly counts (ranging from 1 to 13 units). My goal is to prevent any new orders until the existing stock is significantly reduced, as the current stock already far exceeds the necessary base stock level for this low-demand period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The product is a sweater (knitwear), a highly seasonal item. Historical demand from February (P1-P4) averaged ~35 units/period, but demand has dropped significantly following a regime shift identified in Period 7. For the most recent 5 completed periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 5.0 units per period (10, 1, 9, 4, 1), and for the last 10 periods (P8-P17), it is 5.5 units. With 180 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, there is more than enough inventory to cover the current low-demand summer season, as the stock-to-demand ratio is roughly 36:1. Holding costs match profit ($1.0), requiring a balanced approach to minimize inventory while maintaining some service level. Lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as promised. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-winter low-demand regime while maintaining a small buffer for variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in extreme low-volume summer phase: Periods 8-17 (10 weeks) average 5.5 units/period, compared to spring average of ~11.6 in Periods 7-11.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is mid-summer for this knitwear SKU (Sweater). Demand is extremely low and stable. In the last 10 periods (P9-P18), the total demand was 54 units, averaging 5.4 units per period. In the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has dropped even further to a total of 16 units, averaging 3.2 units per period. The inventory on-hand (179 units) is massively excessive given the current run rate (enough to cover ~50+ periods of current demand). Lead times are stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the absolute minimum demand level, ensuring the OR backend sees no need to order more while holding cost equals profit ($1.00).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The item (679853001) is a basic soft knit sweater, which is currently in its deepest seasonal low during the summer months. Demand has plummeted to near-zero levels: the last 5 completed periods (P15-P19) show demand values of 9, 4, 1, 1, and 0, averaging 3.0 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 179 units, which is extremely high (approximately 60 weeks of cover at the current demand rate). Since the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, and the priority is to avoid ordering any more units while depleting the current surplus inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P1-P4). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed stability. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I am using recent_N with N=12 (covering the low-volume regime since early April) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the extremely low demand environment and suppresses new orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand for the last 5 weeks (Periods 15-19) averaged only 3.0 units/period, down from the spring average of ~11.6.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a knitwear sweater, which is in its seasonal demand trough during the summer months. Historical demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is extremely low, averaging 1.4 units per period (4, 1, 1, 0, 1). The current on-hand inventory is 178 units, which is significantly overstocked relative to current demand and the high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period). With no in-transit orders and a promised lead time of 4 periods, current stock levels cover over 120 periods of demand at current rates. I am setting parameters to cease any new ordering by using a 'recent_N' approach for demand that captures this low-volume regime (N=5) and using the promised lead time of 4, ensuring the OR backend's calculated base stock is far below the existing inventory levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, the peak of the summer season for this knitwear SKU ('Jumper in a soft knit'). Demand has remained extremely low, consistent with previous 'Carry-over Insights', averaging just 0.8 units per period over the last five weeks (P17-P21: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 177 units, and given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), any additional ordering would be detrimental to R_t. To ensure the OR backend does not place an order, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this ultra-low demand regime, and using the 'default' lead time (4 periods). The high on-hand stock far exceeds the base stock level calculated from these low-demand parameters, resulting in an order of 0 as desired.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has dropped further to 0.8 units per period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product 'Sirpa Basic TVP' is a knitwear sweater, which is highly seasonal and currently in a deep demand trough. Historical demand for the last five periods (P18-P22) has been extremely low, averaging 1.4 units per period (1, 0, 1, 1, 4). On-hand inventory is 173 units, with zero in-transit. This stock is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5. Given the excessive on-hand inventory relative to the single-digit weekly demand, the primary goal is to avoid ordering any additional units to minimize further holding costs. I will set the parameters to reflect the most recent low-demand regime to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand inventory levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is mid-summer. The product is 'Knitwear / Jumper', which is highly seasonal. As reflected in the carry-over insights and historical data, demand dropped significantly after the winter/early spring peak (Feb/Mar). In the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23), the total demand was 13 units, averaging 2.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 166 units, which is extremely high given the low summer movement (covering many months of demand at the current rate). With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to hold only meat demand, not build excess. Since on-hand inventory is massively higher than the safety stock or base stock required for the next (L+1) periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime (N=10) to reflect the summer trough. Lead time L is set to default as there are no recent shipments to suggest a change from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists: Average demand for the last 5 completed periods (P19-P23) is 2.6 units per period, consistently below 10 units since Period 14.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the height of summer for this 'Knitwear / Jumper' SKU. Demand remains extremely low as expected for a heavy garment in summer. For the last 5 completed periods (P20-P24), demand were 1, 1, 4, 7, 7, averaging 4.0 units per period. While there is a slight uptick in the last two weeks, the absolute volume is still negligible compared to the on-hand inventory of 159 units. No orders are required as the inventory coverage is more than enough for the foreseeable future. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current summer trough behavior while allowing for the slight observed increase in volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and the product is a knitwear jumper. Historically, demand for this item crashed in February and has remained at a summer trough (averaging < 5 units/period). However, Period 25 shows an uptick to 16 units, which likely signals the very beginning of 'back-to-school' or early autumn interest, as August is a transitional month for apparel. Despite this slight increase, we still have a massive on-hand inventory of 143 units, which is significantly higher than any foreseeable demand given the current regime (the summer average was ~2.6, and even the late-winter peak was only ~45). With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. a profit of $1.0, and a service level q=0.5, the OR backend will target the median demand. We must ensure the OR parameters prevent any new ordering by keeping the base stock below our current inventory (143 + 0 in-transit). I will use a conservative recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent slight increase (averaging ~10 units/period) while still ensuring total system stock is not triggered, as we are already overstocked for this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Potential early autumn transition detected; P25 demand (16 units) is the highest since P8 (April), suggesting a slow exit from the summer trough.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Historical demand for this 'Knitwear / Jumper' SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in winter (Period 1-4, ~100/week), a sharp decline in spring, and a trough during summer (May-July). Recently, demand has begun to rise again as we approach the autumn season, with Period 25 and 26 recording 16 and 17 units respectively, compared to the summer average of <5. This confirms the start of an early autumn transition. On-hand inventory is currently high at 126 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the (L+1) demand window based on current rates (approx 17 units/week * 5 weeks = 85 units). Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite high on-hand levels, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the current upward trend while maintaining a 'default' L. Given that profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the service level target is 0.5, meaning we want exactly enough stock to meet mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Autumn transition confirmed; demand for the last 2 weeks (P25-P26) averaged 16.5 units, more than double the summer average of approx 4 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (knitwear) is entering its autumn peak. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 59 units, confirming a significant upward shift from the summer trough (avg ~4) and the early autumn transition (avg ~16.5). The current period date is 2019/8/19, which aligns with the start of high-season demand for sweaters. My current inventory is 67 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, I must ensure inventory covers the next 5 periods (L+1). If the new regime averages ~40-60 units/week, I am at risk of a stockout soon. I will shift to 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent sharp acceleration (avg: 16, 17, 59 = 30.6/week) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. This will signal the OR backend to place a restocking order now.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Seasonal peak transition confirmed; demand jumped to 59 units in P27, following P25-26 avg of 16.5 units. Weekly demand regime has shifted from <10 units (summer) to >30 units (early autumn peak).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Sirpa Basic TVP sweater) has definitively entered its autumn peak season. Demand in the last two periods (P27: 59, P28: 58) has stabilized at a much higher level compared to the summer trough (<5) and the early August transition (~16). As we are now in late August, this elevated demand is expected to persist or increase as temperatures drop. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the optimal service level is 50% (the median), though the system's stock-out penalties are high. On-hand inventory is very low (9 units) with 72 units in-transit (ordered P28, expected P32). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2-period average (approx 58.5) to capture the current peak, or use explicit forecasting. Given that L=4, we need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods. 5 * 58.5 = 292.5. Current inventory position is 9 + 72 = 81. I will set mu_hat to 300 to trigger a significant restock order and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this seasonal jump.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand for P27-P28 stabilized at ~58.5 units/period, roughly 15x the summer average, following the seasonal transition identified in P25-P26.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'soft knit jumper', which is highly seasonal. We are now in early September (2019-09-02), entering the peak autumn/winter demand regime. Historical demand for the last three periods (P27-P29) has been 59, 58, and 47 units (average 54.7), marking a massive shift from the summer trough. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 164 units in-transit (ordered in P28 and P29). Since the lead time is 4 periods, these orders will not arrive until P32 and P33 respectively, meaning we will face stockouts in P30 and P31. To maximize recovery, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new high-demand regime. Using N=3 for the recent surge (P27-P29) captures the current average of ~55 units per period. I am maintaining the promised lead time of 4 until actual arrival data suggests otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand for P27-P29 averaged 54.7 units/period, confirming a high-volume seasonal regime for this knitwear SKU.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 679853001 (knitwear) has entered a high-volume seasonal peak as expected for September. The most recent demand (Period 30) surged to 117 units, significantly higher than the previous three-week average of ~55 units. Given that we are currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) and the lead time is 4 periods, we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (230 units). The orders placed in Periods 28, 29, and 30 (72, 92, and 66 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 32, 33, and 34 respectively. To capture this sudden spike and prevent further lost sales during the autumn peak, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to reflect the most recent regime shift (last 4 periods: P27-P30), where demand averaged 70.25 units. Although the historical average is much lower due to the summer trough, the current seasonal context (September) warrants using a higher forecast. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to project this peak demand across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30 demand (117 units) indicates a significant upward shift from the previous average of ~55 units/period (P27-P29). Demand regime is now highly volatile and peaking for the winter season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak seasonal transition. Demand has consistently accelerated: P27 (59), P28 (58), P29 (47), P30 (117), and P31 (139). Calculating the mean for the 'Autumn/Winter Peak' regime (P27-P31) results in 84 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 352 units in-transit (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Based on the promised lead time of 4, the first significant arrival (P28 order of 72 units) is expected to arrive during the upcoming Period 32 resolution, becoming observable at the start of Period 33. Until then, the stockout persists. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as arrivals from P1-P4 were exactly 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P27-P31) to capture the high-volume seasonal demand while smoothing the recent jump to ~130. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~41) observed during this peak to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for these high-value weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak regime confirmed: Demand from P27-P31 averaged 84 units/period, a massive increase from the summer trough (<5 units). The last 2 weeks (P30-P31) specifically show a jump to ~128 units/period, indicating high seasonal volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Knitwear Jumper', currently entering its peak Autumn/Winter season (late September). Demand has surged significantly: the last five periods (P28-P32) show demand of 58, 47, 117, 139, and 123 units, averaging approximately 96.8 units/period. The most recent three weeks (P30-P32) show an even higher average of 126.3 units/period, reflecting the intensify seasonal peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 348 units in transit (ordered P29-P32). An order of 92 units from P29 is expected to arrive during the current period (P33), but won't be visible until P34. Given the high demand and stockout situation, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current peak volume (~126 units/period), and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the seasonal transition. Lead time L is maintained at the default promised 4 periods, which has been consistent in recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensify: Demand for P30-P32 averaged 126.3 units/period, up from 54.7 in P27-P29. The SKU is now in its maximum seasonal volume phase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear/Jumper) is currently in its peak autumn/winter seasonal phase, with Period 33 demand surging to 264 units. The recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is approximately 138 units/period, but given the massive jump in the most recent period, the regime is clearly still accelerating. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 451 units in-transit. An order of 66 units (from P30) is expected to arrive in Period 34, and 122 units (from P31) in Period 35. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent peak and anticipated continued growth. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (approx 136 units/period * 5 periods for L+1), and use a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (demand ranging from 47 to 264 in the last 5 weeks). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: SKU enters maximum seasonal peak; Period 33 demand (264) is 2x the previous 3-week average (126.3), indicating high seasonal acceleration and volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear Jumper) is in its maximum seasonal peak. Demand over the last two periods (P33 and P34) has surged significantly to an average of 261 units/period, compared to the previous three-week average of ~126. This confirms a massive acceleration into the winter season. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in P32, P33, and P34), so L remains at 'default'. To capture the current hyper-peak and high volatility while avoiding under-ordering during this critical window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of data (N=2) to reflect the 250+ unit demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the spike in variance. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1) = 5 period risk horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme seasonal peak confirmed; demand for P33-P34 averaged 261 units/period, a 100% increase from the early-September peak average of ~126 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak seasonal phase (October). Demand in the last three periods (P33-P35) has been extremely high and volatile: 264, 258, and 228 units, averaging 250 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand far exceeding past arrivals (P35 arrived 122 units against 228 demand). Pipeline inventory is 814 units, but given the 4-period lead time and the current demand rate (~250/week), the system needs to maintain a very high base stock to avoid stockouts in the upcoming winter months. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current hyper-peak regime and ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently to cover the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Peak winter demand confirmed and sustained for 3 weeks (P33-P35) averaging 250 units/period, roughly double the early-September average of ~126 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak winter demand phase (October). Demand for the last 4 periods (P33-P36) has been extremely high, averaging 236.25 units per period (264, 258, 228, 195). While P36 showed a slight dip to 195, this remains significantly elevated compared to the September average of ~126. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a high volume of backlogged demand (stockouts have occurred every period since P29). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk and seasonal peak, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current ~236 units/week average across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Sustained peak winter demand confirmed; last 4 weeks (P33-P36) averaged 236 units/period, establishing a high-volume regime significantly above the early autumn average of 126.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its peak winter demand phase. The demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37: 264, 258, 228, 195, 206) has stabilized at a high volume, averaging approximately 230 units per period. Despite significant arrivals (195 units in P37), the on-hand inventory remains at 0 because demand continues to exceed or match incoming stock, indicating a persistent stockout situation and high unmet seasonal demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the heavy seasonal volume and ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to cover the (L+1) window, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-volume regime (approx 230 * 5 = 1150). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current high volatility of the winter peak. L remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Winter peak demand stabilized at a high volume; demand for the last 5 completed periods (P33-P37) averaged 230.2 units/period, maintaining a consistently high-volume regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak winter demand phase for this knitwear SKU. Demand has stabilized at high levels, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 224.8 units. The last observed demand (P38) was 237 units. On-hand inventory is currently 46 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 868 units (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). Shipments have consistently arrived with a 4-period lead time. To maintain service levels during this high-volume peak while accounting for high volatility (std dev for P34-P38 is approx 24), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized winter peak regime accurately. This N covers the period since the volume shift to >200 units/period became consistent.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak winter demand season for this knitwear SKU. Demand for the last 5 completed periods (P35-P39) averaged 207.8 units/period, down slightly from the absolute peak of ~230 units observed earlier, but still very high volume. Inventory management is critical here as holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5. However, since the SKU is in a high-demand seasonal window with high volatility (\u03c3), we need to maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts. Currently, we have 141 units on-hand and 810 units in pipeline. The pipeline includes orders from P36 (282), P37 (154), P38 (164), and P39 (210). Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the 282 units from P36 to arrive 'during' Period 40. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized peak demand level (avg ~208) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std dev is significant in this regime). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Winter peak demand remains high but shows signs of stabilization; demand for P35-P39 (last 5 weeks) averaged 207.8 units/period, compared to the previously observed peak of 230 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its peak winter demand phase. For the last 5 completed periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 200.0 units per period (195, 206, 237, 173, 189). While there is a slight decrease from the absolute peak seen in late September/early October (avg ~250), demand remains high and stable. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. With 234 units on hand and 616 units in the pipeline (ordered in P37, P38, P39, P40), and the game nearing its conclusion at Period 47, the current inventory strategy should focus on covering the approximately 1,000 units of demand expected between now and the end of the lead-time horizon (P41 to P45) while being mindful of the 47-period limit. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current stable-high demand regime and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to account for current volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear/Jumper) is currently in its peak winter demand phase. As of Period 42 (Nov 25), we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47). Demand has stabilized around a lower high-volume plateau; the average demand for the last 5 completed periods (P37-P41) is 194 units, compared to the earlier peak average of ~230. The most recent demand (P41: 165) suggests a slight cooling or stabilization. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 223, and in-transit is 612 (consisting of orders from P38: 164, P39: 210, P40: 88, P41: 150). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. To avoid overstocking as we approach the final periods of the game (P47), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the L+1 window) to capture the current plateau of ~194 units/period, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Winter peak plateau identified; demand for P37-P41 averaged 194 units/period, showing a slight decrease from the mid-October peak of 230.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear/Jumper) experienced a massive 'Black Friday' demand spike in Period 42 (661 units compared to the previous 5-week average of ~194). This has depleted all on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. While Period 42's demand is likely an outlier driven by the late November sales event, demand in early December (Period 43) usually remains significantly higher than autumn averages but lower than the Black Friday peak. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the need to restore service levels, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=5) to capture the high-volume winter regime while partially moderating the influence of the single 661-unit spike. mu_hat will use the last 5 completed periods (P38-P42: 237, 173, 189, 165, 661; mean=285) to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining winter weeks, while sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect the extreme volatility (std \u2248 211). The OR backend will balance the high volatility against the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (661 units). This represents a 240% increase over the previous 5-week plateau of ~194 units. High volatility expected to continue through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its peak winter demand phase. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (661 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, which resulted in a stockout. Period 43 demand dropped to 118 units, but this follows a significant stockout and may be partially suppressed or represent a return to the previous peak plateau (avg ~194 units observed in P37-P41). Given the current date (Dec 9), we are in the heart of the December holiday season. The OR engine needs to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L=4 + 1 review period). I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the pre-Black Friday plateau of ~200 units per period to ensure adequate stock for the remainder of December, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods which has been consistent in all concluding orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand stabilized at 118 units following the Black Friday spike, though this remains elevated above autumn levels and is consistent with a high-volume winter plateau.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Demand has stabilized from the Period 42 spike (661 units) to 118 units (P43) and 101 units (P44). This SKU (knitwear) is in its peak winter season. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 79 units, with 919 units in-transit (reflecting the large order of 634 units placed in Period 43 to cover the spike residue and seasonal demand). With 4 periods of lead time remaining in the game (ending Period 47), we must ensure we cover the remaining high-demand weeks without over-ordering as the simulation concludes. I will use the last 2 weeks (P43-P44) as the most representative recent demand regime (avg ~110), rather than including the extreme outlier of Black Friday.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization: Demand in P43-P44 averaged 109.5 units, significantly lower than the P42 spike (661) but consistent with the pre-spike winter plateau of ~190 units, suggesting a return to seasonal norms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak winter demand phase. Current date is 2019-12-23, which is the week of Christmas. While Period 42 showed a massive Black Friday spike (661 units), the subsequent weeks (P43-P45) have stabilized with demand between 101 and 124, averaging 114.3 units. This suggests the holiday rush is tapering but will likely remain elevated through early January due to post-Christmas sales and cold weather. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 105. In-transit is 769 units (composed of P42 order: 135 arriving P46, P43 order: 634 arriving P47). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the expected seasonal drop-off after New Year's, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent post-spike average (last 3 weeks, N=3) to avoid over-ordering as the season late-peaks and begins its transition towards spring.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) has settled into a high-winter regime of ~114 units/period, significantly lower than the P42 spike but consistent with non-promotional seasonal peak expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, right at the end of the holiday season and entering the New Year. Demand in the last three periods (P44-P46) has stabilized at a high winter volume, with an average of 120 units per period (101, 124, 135). This is significantly lower than the extreme October/November peaks but represents a solid winter plateau. Actual lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P42 order arrived in P46). On-hand inventory is 105, and there is a massive in-transit order of 634 units from P43 (designed to recover from the Black Friday stockout) which is expected to arrive in P47. Since total pipeline inventory (739 units) already covers roughly 6 weeks of demand at the current 120 units/period rate, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or minimal new orders. To maintain stability, I am using a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the post-Black Friday stabilization (P43-P46) while ignoring the extreme outlier in P42.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P46) has stabilized into a high-winter plateau averaging 119.5 units/period, roughly 50% of the mid-October peak volume.
