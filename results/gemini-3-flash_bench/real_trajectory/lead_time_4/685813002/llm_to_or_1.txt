Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Petar Sweatshirt' for men. The initial on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [64, 36, 45, 52, 56], with a mean of 50.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 10.4. Because this is the first period and we have no history of actual lead times or stockouts yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and the mean of all available historical samples to set the base stock level. The OR engine will calculate the order to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. mu_hat should reflect the total expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (5 periods * 50.6 = 253). sigma_hat will be sqrt(5) * 10.4 \u2248 23.25. Since no changepoints are detected in the initial data, 'default' or 'recent_N' with N=5 is appropriate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), currently in the late winter season where demand should be stable. The historical demand samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) show a mean of 50.6. Period 1 demand was 54, aligning with this average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (69 units) was placed in Period 1 and the promised lead time is 4 periods. We expect that order to arrive in Period 5. With a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using the mean of the last 6 samples (50.6 * 5 = 253) as a baseline for mu_hat. For volatility, the samples have a standard deviation of approximately 10.3; sqrt(5)*10.3 \u2248 23. Since holding cost is equal to profit ($1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which means the base stock will likely be centered on the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the available history including Period 1 demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a Men's Jersey Sweatshirt. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of 50.6 units/week. Periods 1 and 2 showed demands of 54 and 68, indicating a slight upward trend. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 (137 units total) are in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and 6 respectively. We are currently out of stock. Since we are in late February moving into March, there is no immediate seasonal spike expected for basic jersey sweatshirts, but we should prepare for consistent demand. I will use the last 5 demand samples (including the 2 from the game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use the default promised lead time of 4 until actual arrivals provide evidence for a different L.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a Men's \u2018PETAR SWEATSHIRT\u2019. Historically, demand for the last five known weeks (provided in the prompt) was [64, 36, 45, 52, 56], averaging 50.6 units. Since the simulation started, recorded demand has been [54, 68, 57], averaging 59.7. This indicates a slightly higher demand regime than the initial historical data. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 206 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (69 units), Period 2 (68 units), and Period 3 (69 units) are still in transit as per the lead time definition (P1 order arrives P5, P2 arrives P6, etc.). At this stage, no arrivals have occurred, and no shipments are confirmed lost or delayed as we haven't reached Period 5 yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~60) and 'default' for sigma and lead time to maintain stability while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand (including the provided seed data) averages approximately 52.6 units per week (min 36, max 68). Our on-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, the first order placed in Period 1 (69 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase. This arrival will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 278 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4), which aligns with the total ordered quantity (69+68+69+72). Since actual lead time hasn't been confirmed via a 'conclude' message yet, I will use the promised L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the average of all available data (5 seed + 4 historical = 9 samples) is roughly 52 units/period. Over (1+L)=5 periods, this equals 260. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this mean. For volatility (sigma_hat), the standard deviation across all samples is approximately 11.5; over 5 periods, this scales to about 25.7.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a soft sweatshirt, a basic garment usually seeing steady demand but sensitive to early spring transitions. Historical demand (10 samples) shows mean=50.7, std=11.37. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 36, 37, 37) suggests a slight stabilization or dip below the early Jan/Feb levels. In Period 5, we saw our first arrival from the Period 1 order, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Currently, on-hand is 32 units with 209 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period mean (approx 44.4) for mu_hat gives a base stock target around 222 units. Since in-transit(209) + on-hand(32) = 241, we are currently well-covered against near-term demand. The parameter settings use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (last 5 periods) compared to the higher Jan start.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a soft sweatshirt, which typically sees higher demand in colder months. Historical demand samples (Early Jan: 64, 36, 45, 52, 56) and early game history (Feb: 54, 68, 57; March: 36, 37, 28) show a clear downward trend as spring approaches. Specifically, demand has dropped from an average of ~55 units/period to ~33 units/period over the last three periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 72 units on hand and 152 in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given the declining seasonal demand (L+1 = 5 periods), the pipeline of 152 units already covers over 4.5 periods of demand at the recent rate of 33. I will use the last 5 demand samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this cooling demand while maintaining service levels, and use the promised lead time (default) which is consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 4: Mean demand decreased from ~60 to ~33 (-45%) as seasonality transitions from winter to spring.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which is seeing a seasonal decline in demand as winter ends. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 50.6, but the 'recent regime' (observed since Period 4/March 4th) has stabilized at a significantly lower mean: 36, 37, 28, and 35 (mean ~34). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed consistently by arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving exactly in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Currently, we have 106 units on hand and 85 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 4, 6, and 7). Pipeline inventory is 106 (on-hand) + 85 (in-transit) = 191 units. With a lead time of 4, we need base stock to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. At a mean of 34, expected demand is ~170. Since our pipeline (191) exceeds this, the OR engine will likely order 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the lower spring demand and calculate for L since the 4-period lead time is now proven.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a soft sweatshirt, typically a winter/early spring item. Period 8 saw an unexpected demand spike to 55, up from the previously established spring regime mean of approx. 33. This could be due to late spring cold periods or clearing sales. However, looking at periods 4-7, demand was 36, 37, 28, 35 (mean ~34). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent for the first 4 orders. My on-hand inventory (123) is high relative to current demand, covering nearly 4 periods of demand at the recent average. Pipeline inventory is low (13), with orders from P6 (11 units) and P7 (2 units) expected to arrive in Periods 10 and 11 respectively. Because on-hand is high and profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock will likely be lower than on-hand, leading to zero orders from the OR backend. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower spring demand regime (Periods 4-8) while acknowledging the recent spike in the mean and variance calculation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which exhibits seasonality shifts as we move from winter toward late spring. The carry-over insight from Period 7 noted a demand regime shift starting around Period 4, where average demand dropped from ~60 to ~33. Since then, demand has averaged 37.8 units (Periods 5-9: 37, 28, 35, 55, 34), though Period 8 showed a brief spike (55). The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Currently, we have 89 units on-hand and 68 in-transit (orders from Period 6, 7, and 9). The orders from Period 6 (11 units) and Period 7 (2 units) are due to arrive in Period 10 and 11 respectively. To set parameters, I will focus on the recent demand regime (last 6 periods, including Period 4 where the drop began) to capture the lower spring demand level. L remains at the promised 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=6) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates rather than the high early-period winter demand.

Current date is 2019/4/22. Demand context: The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a low-demand spring/summer season. Since Period 4, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Looking at the last 7 periods (P4-P10), demand values are [36, 37, 28, 35, 55, 34, 24], averaging ~35.6 units/period. The spike in P8 (55) appears to be an outlier or minor fluctuation rather than a trend reversal given the drop to 34 and 24 thereafter. Lead time analysis: Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The P5 order was a quantity of 0, and the P7 order (2 units) is expected to arrive in Period 11 (this period). Inventory state: On-hand is 76. In-transit consists of orders from P7 (2), P9 (55), and P10 (31), totaling 88 units. Total pipeline is 164. Given L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~35, required stock is roughly 175. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu and sigma to capture this lower spring demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which has moved out of its peak winter season. Since Period 4, demand has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of approximately 35.6 units per period (last 8 periods: 36, 37, 28, 35, 55, 34, 24, 39). The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Current inventory status reflects 39 units on-hand and 100 units in-transit (orders from Period 9, 10, and 11). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My parameters aim to maintain a stock level around 178 units (5 * 35.6). With 139 units already in the system, the OR backend will calculate the appropriate replenishment based on these settings. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-winter demand regime shift identified in Period 7.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a sweatshirt (warm garment), and demand has stabilized into a lower spring regime as documented in Carry-over Insights. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 24, 39, 35, and 33.8 avg) remains consistent with the post-winter drop. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Inventory check: On-hand is low (4 units). In-transit is high (141 units), consisting of orders from P9 (55), P10 (31), P11 (14), and P12 (41). The P9 order (55 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P13), which will replenish the stockpile before demand resolution. Given profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the lower demand regime since P4) to estimate mean demand and volatility, as this captures the current seasonal reality without being overly influenced by the initial high-demand winter weeks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Based on the product description (Petar Sweatshirt, soft brushed inside) and the carry-over insights, the demand has settled into a lower-volume spring regime. Since Period 4, demand has averaged approximately 34.7 units per period, a significant drop from the pre-Period 4 average of ~55. Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P13). There is no evidence of lost shipments; the orders from P10, P11, and P12 are currently in transit and within the expected lead time window. Given the current on-hand inventory (35) and the pipeline inventory (121), the total current coverage is 156 units. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~35, we need approximately 175 units. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 35 * 5 = 175). For variability, I'll use the same window to reflect the reduced volatility in the spring season. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is a cold-weather garment. Current date is May 20th (Period 15). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the early periods (Feb/March). Analysis of samples from Period 6 to 14 (N=9) shows an average demand of approximately 33.2 units per week, consistent with the shift identified in the carry-over insights. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly lower (24, 25, 35), averaging around 28. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory posture: On-hand is 41 with 108 in transit. The pipeline includes orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and low profit margin ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this stabilized spring demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it is stable.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27) shows a continuation of the spring/summer low-demand regime for the sweatshirt SKU. Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 12 periods (P4-P15) with an average of 32.3 units per week, compared to the initial winter average of ~56 units. Lead times are consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5-P8, P10-P11, and P13-P15). I will use N=12 for demand to capture this entire post-winter regime, providing a stable baseline. This ensures the base stock calculation targets (L+1) * 32.3 units while accounting for current on-hand (35) and in-transit (112) inventory. The holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), so the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will naturally target using these parameters.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt. Historical data and seasonal context confirm a demand regime shift occurred around Period 4 (March). In the 'winter' phase (Periods 1-4), mean demand was ~54; in the 'spring/early summer' phase (Periods 5-16), demand dropped and stabilized. For the last 12 periods, mean demand is ~28.25 units with a standard deviation of ~9.7 units. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). On-hand inventory is 56, and pipeline inventory is 88 (orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Total stock/pipeline is 144 units. At the current demand rate (~28.25/period), this covers roughly 5.1 periods, which is close to the L+1 target of 5. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-winter regime and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (June 10). The product is a sweatshirt, which is seasonally low-demand during the summer months in the northern hemisphere. Historical demand from Period 1 to 4 averaged 53.75 units, but since Period 5, demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 28.5 units over the last 13 periods (P5-P17). The last 5 periods (P13-P17) show an even lower average of 22.2 units, indicating a continued seasonal decline. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods for all 10 concluded shipments. On-hand inventory (69) plus in-transit stock (66) totals 135 units, which covers over 6 periods of demand at current rates. Given the seasonal nature of 'soft brushed' sweatshirts in June, I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower summer regime while smoothing out weekly noise. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N 10 to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state. Lead time L is set to calculate as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized at lower summer levels: mean demand decreased to ~22 units/week starting Period 13.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), managing the PETAR SWEATSHIRT. The product description\u2014a 'top in soft sweatshirt fabric' with 'soft brushed inside'\u2014indicates a cold-weather garment. Moving from spring into summer (June), demand has consistently declined. As noted in the Carry-over Insights, a regime shift occurred around Period 13, where demand stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 22 units/week (last 6 periods: 24, 25, 20, 20, 22, 24). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all recent arrivals had an actual lead time of 4). Currently, we have 63 units on-hand and 62 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand summer period, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6-period regime (N=6). This will lead to a base stock calculation reflecting the current average of ~22.5 units per week across L+1 periods, helping to reduce the current inventory surplus.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a PETAR SWEATSHIRT, which naturally experiences lower demand during the summer months (current date: June 24). Historical demand data and carry-over insights confirm two significant downtrends: from ~60 units to ~33 units starting in Period 4, and a further stabilization to ~22 units/week starting in Period 13. Looking at the most recent seven periods (P13-P19), demand has averaged 20.57 units (24, 25, 20, 20, 22, 24, 9). The very low demand in Period 19 (9 units) suggests we should remain conservative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 72 and in-transit at 44 (total coverage 116 units), and expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5) being approximately 110 units (5 * 22), our current position is well-balanced but slightly high on inventory relative to the holding cost ($1.0/unit). I will use the recent 7-period window to capture the current summer low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing SKU 685813002 (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), a seasonal item that has entered a low-demand summer phase. The current date is early July, confirming the mid-summer demand trough. Looking at the demand history since Period 13 (early May), mean demand has dropped significantly. Specifically, the last two periods (P19, P20) showed demand of only 9 and 10 units respectively, further confirming the downward shift noted in the Carry-over Insights (mean ~22). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at exactly 4 periods (as seen in all arrival messages from P5 through P20). Our on-hand inventory (79) plus in-transit stock (27) equals 106 pipeline units. Given the low summer demand, this is more than sufficient for the next (L+1) = 5 periods (expected requirement \u2248 5 * 22 = 110 at the previous mean, or closer to 5 * 13 = 65 at the very recent rate). Because Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering data since Period 13) to capture the stabilized summer mean (~19 units), and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 periods is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further downward in mid-summer: Periods 19-20 showed a drop below 10 units/period, suggesting a July low-point mean of ~15 units vs previous summer estimate of 22.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a soft sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), a category traditionally facing its lowest demand during the peak summer months. We have observed a significant and sustained downward shift in demand over the last three periods (P19-P21), with weekly demand dropping to 9, 10, and 11 respectively. This confirms the earlier insight that mid-summer demand has stabilized around ~10 units per period. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (81 units) and a holding cost equal to profit ($1/unit), our primary objective is to stop ordering until inventory levels align with this much lower demand regime. Setting L to 'calculate' uses the established 4-period history; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 targets the most recent summer demand trough (approx 10 units/week), which effectively signals the OR backend to restrict ordering in the face of excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed mid-summer demand trough for sweatshirts starting P19: average weekly demand dropped to ~10 units (Periods 19-21), significantly lower than the previous summer estimate of 22.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Petar Sweatshirt, which is currently in its mid-summer seasonal trough (July). Evidence from Periods 19-22 shows a significant drop in demand, with weekly values of 9, 10, 11, and 17. The mean demand for this mid-summer period is approximately 11.75 units. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods. My on-hand inventory is currently 78 units with no units in transit. Given that L=4, the base stock targets the demand for L+1 (5) periods. At a mean of ~12 units/period, the total expected demand over the next 5 periods is approximately 60 units. Since on-hand inventory (78) already exceeds this coverage requirement and holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), the system should avoid further ordering to minimize inventory carrying costs. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the recent 4-period average (5 * 11.75 = 58.75) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime. Setting L to default (4) as lead times are stable.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, the peak of summer. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a cool-weather item now in its deep mid-summer demand trough. Recent weekly demand (Periods 19-23) has been 9, 10, 11, 17, 17, averaging roughly 12.8 units/period. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. With on-hand inventory at 61 and no units in transit, and assuming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, my total pipeline coverage (L+1 = 5 periods) requires approximately 5 * 12.8 = 64 units. Since on-hand is 61, the OR backend will calculate a minimal or zero order. Given Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0, the desired service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the current low-demand summer regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Historically, the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (a fall/winter garment) saw a demand trough during July (Periods 19-24, averaging ~12.5 units). However, most retail environments see the beginning of fall-winter collection interest and early back-to-school preparation in August. Recent demand in Period 25 was 16 units, up slightly from the July lows, signaling the start of a seasonal recovery. The lead time has been exceptionally stable at 4 periods. The OR engine needs to begin building inventory for the upcoming autumn peak, which usually ramps up significantly in September/October. I will set mu_hat to reflect a mean demand of approximately 20 units/week for the next 5-week coverage window (Lead 4 + Review 1), anticipating a moderate seasonal increase from the summer low. sigma_hat is set to capture the volatility seen during transitions. On-hand + In-transit (34 + 65 = 99) is currently sufficient for ~5 weeks at 20 units/period, but higher base stock is needed to prepare for the inevitable volume increase in autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery started Period 25: July trough (~12.5) transitioning into August early-autumn prep; forecasting a rise to 20+ units/week for the upcoming cycle.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are exiting the summer demand trough (approx. 10-15 units/week) and entering the pre-autumn phase for this sweatshirt SKU. Historically, demand in February/March was ~50-60 units. As of Period 25 and 26, demand is showing signs of recovery (16 and 15 units respectively). I previousy identified a demand recovery trend in 'Carry-over Insights'. To prepare for the autumn ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect a mean of 35 units per week across the lead time + review period (1+L = 5), resulting in a value of 175. This is a bridge between summer lows (~12) and late-winter highs (~55). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture recent volatility during the transition. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4) as arrivals have been consistently appearing 4 periods after ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are entering the late-August period, which marks the start of the autumn retail season for 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. Historical demand has shown a summer trough (Periods 19-24, mean ~12) and a slight recovery in recent weeks (Periods 25-27, mean ~16.3). As temperatures traditionally drop pathing into September, demand for sweatshirts is expected to rise. I am forecasting a mean demand of 25 units per week for the upcoming cycle (Lead time 4 + 1 review period = 5 periods), which is a conservative step up from the mid-summer low but below the spring peak (~33). Pipeline inventory is high (107 units), mostly due to large orders placed in Period 25 (62 units) and Period 27 (41 units). The order from P24 (3 units) is expected to arrive this period (P28), and the large P25 order (62 units) next period (P29). My goal is to ensure the base stock covers a 5-period horizon at ~25 units/week (total ~125), but the OR engine's cap and existing pipeline will likely limit new ordering this week. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to signal this expected seasonal uptick.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand recovery post-July trough: Periods 25-27 showing mean of 16.3 units, trending upwards toward autumn seasonal levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), we are entering the peak autumn demand cycle for sweatshirts. Historical demand data from the start of the year (late winter) showed levels around 50-60 units. While the July trough averaged ~12 units, the last period (P28) saw a sharp spike to 31 units, confirming the anticipated seasonal recovery. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the trend change from 15-18 units up to 31, and using an explicit lead time of 4. Although the OR backend's inventory balancing will consider the 121 units in transit, the current stockout requires parameters that support aggressive replenishment for the returning high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P28 demand reached 31 units, up from P25-P27 mean of 16.3. Transitioning parameter focus to higher seasonal baseline (targeting 30+ units/week).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. As we transition into September, we are entering the peak autumn demand season for sweatshirts. Period 28 saw a spike to 31 units, followed by a low of 9 units in Period 29. This fluctuation is likely noise or a minor timing shift in consumer behavior as the weather cools. Looking at the broader seasonal context (and historical data from Year 1), early autumn demand typically stabilizes significantly higher than summer levels (~15-20), moving toward 30-45 units. The Period 29 drop (9 units) followed a stockout in Period 28 (where demand was 31 but sales were only 4), which may have temporarily displaced customer traffic. I will maintain a forecast mean of 30 units per period to ensure adequate stock for the seasonal ramp-up. Pipeline inventory (59) and on-hand (53) totaling 112 units covers approximately 3.7 periods at 30 units/period, which is slightly below the L+1 (5 period) target. I will use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility increase (18, 31, 9) while setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the expected seasonal shift.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand transition phase as we move into September (autumn). Period 30 showed a significant spike in demand to 59 units, which exhausted our on-hand inventory (ending at 0). This confirms the 'Autumn demand surge' identified in Period 29. Historically, January/February demand for this sweatshirt was in the 50-60 range, and we are returning to those levels. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 96 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 27, 28, and 30), we need to set parameters to ensure we cover the (L+1) period demand window (5 weeks). Given the recent demand jump from ~30 to ~60, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward momentum (P28: 31, P29: 9, P30: 59). Mu_hat will target a mean of approximately 33 units per week (multiplied by 1+L=5), resulting in a base stock level roughly around 165. This balances the risk of stockouts during the surge against the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 59 units, matching early-year high-season levels (Jan/Feb). The transition from the August mean of ~16 units to September levels of 50+ is now clearly evidenced.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019). The data confirms a massive autumn demand surge for the sweatshirt SKU. Demand in Period 30 was 59 units and Period 31 reached 85 units. This matches or exceeds the high-season levels seen in Jan/Feb (approx 50-70 units). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 124 units in transit (expected arrivals from Period 28, 30, and 31 orders). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must set our demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this high-demand regime to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect a weekly demand of 70 units (70 * 5 = 350) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand intensified: Period 31 demand reached 85 units, surpassing early-year highs. Mean demand for Sept-Oct cycle is now estimated at 70+ units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant autumn demand surge for the sweatshirt SKU. Last period (P32) demand was 71 units, following high points of 85 and 59. The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is 71.6 units, but given the stockouts in these periods, the actual latent demand likely exceeds this. The carry-over insights suggest an autumn peak of 70+ units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to consecutive stockouts (P30, P31, P32). Total pipeline inventory is 211 units (orders from P30, P31, P32). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, these orders will arrive in P34, P35, and P36. For the current Period 33, we need to order to cover demand through P37 (L+1 periods). Using an explicit mu_hat of 375 (based on a mean of 75 units/week across 5 periods) to ensure the OR backend places a robust order to replenish stock and meet the heightened seasonal demand. N=3 for sigma_hat captures the recent high volatility observed during the surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge has stabilized at a high level: periods 30-32 show an average demand of ~72 units/week, with stockouts suggesting latent demand may be higher (~75-80).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn/winter demand season for sweatshirts (Product: PETAR SWEATSHIRT). Demand has surged significantly from summer lows (~10-15 units) to recent highs of 116 units in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 308 units and a promised lead time of 4 periods. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 82.75 units. Period 33 demand reached 116 units, but given the stockout, actual demand may be even higher. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method at 400 units, which reflects a weekly forecast of 80 units across the 5-period cycle (L+1, where L=4). This aligns with the recent 4-week average and anticipates sustained peak-season demand. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (explicit) to account for high volatility and ensure a high service level, which is optimal given that Profit ($1) is equal to Holding Cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand surged to 116 units in Period 33, significantly higher than the previous estimate of 70+. New demand regime mean for peak season estimated at 80+ units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019, which is peak autumn/early winter season for sweatshirts. Historical data and recent carry-over insights confirm a significant demand regime shift. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has surged significantly (59, 85, 71, 116, 95), averaging 85.2 units per week. This is a massive increase from the summer trough (~12 units) and even significantly higher than the beginning of the year (~55 units). Despite orders arriving on a consistent 4-period lead time, we have experienced stockouts in the last 5 periods (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for five consecutive periods), indicating that our inventory levels are lagging behind the intensified seasonal demand. The in-transit inventory is 362 units (from orders in P31, P32, P33, P34), with an expected arrival of 69 units (ordered P31) during Period 35's resolution. To capture the full latent demand and stop the stockout cycle, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current autumn peak (approx 85 units/week across the L+1 window) and L to calculate to maintain the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand regime (P30-P34) confirmed: mean weekly demand has increased to ~85 units, surpassing the previous estimate of 70+ and matching high-season behavior for the 'Top in soft sweatshirt fabric' product.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is firmly in a high-season regime as we enter mid-October. Recent demand samples (P30-P35) are: 59, 85, 71, 116, 95, 69. The mean across these last 6 periods is 82.5 units/week. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 6 of the last 6 periods) indicate that actual demand often exceeds observed sales and inventory availability. For Period 36, I am targeting a base demand of approximately 85 units per week to account for this latent demand. Using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat will capture this high-season average (~82.5) and project it across the lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen during the autumn surge compared to the summer trough. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late October (Period 37), which is peak season for the 'Top in soft sweatshirt fabric'. Recent demand has been high but volatile: P33 (116), P34 (95), P35 (69), and P36 (43). The lower P36 demand (43) might be a temporary fluctuation or a slight cooling from the extreme P33-P34 peak, but it remains significantly higher than the summer trough. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 77 units/week. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 61, with 309 in-transit. Given the high season, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the autumn/winter regime (~77 units) while accounting for the recent variance. This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock (targeting ~385 units total pipeline) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 30-35 as the weather stays cold.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn/winter (P30-P36) with an average of ~77 units/week. While P36 showed a drop to 43, the overall trend since September remains high-season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for sweatshirts. Historical demand since September (Period 30) has averaged approximately 75 units/week (59, 85, 71, 116, 95, 69, 43, 87), though it fluctuates significantly. Period 36 was an outlier low (43) but Period 37 rebounded to 87 units. Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 71, and pipeline inventory is 227 (orders from P34: 92, P35: 64, P36: 56, P37: 15). We need to maintain a high base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5). Total pipeline + on-hand is currently 298. If we assume a mean of 75, 5 weeks of demand is 375. The current total (298) is slightly low. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 375 (75 * 5) and use a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in peak season demand (individual weeks ranging from 43 to 116).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (sweatshirt) is in its peak demand season (Autumn/Winter). Over the most recent 9 periods (P30-P38), demand has averaged 79.2 units, significantly higher than the summer trough. The last two periods (P37, P38) showed stable high demand at 87 and 88 units respectively, confirming that the high-season regime is sustained. Inventory is currently recovering: 75 units are on-hand and 212 units are in-transit (expected arrivals from P35, P36, P37, and P38 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent delivery history. To prevent stockouts during this peak while balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to account for the volatility seen during the autumn surge (e.g., the spike to 116 units).

Carry-over insight: Peak demand regime (P30-P38) remains stable at ~80 units/week, with the last two cycles showing very low variance (87, 88).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a men's sweatshirt, currently in the peak autumn/winter demand regime (P30-P39). Demand has stabilized at a high level with a mean of approximately 80 units per week over the last 10 periods. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P36-P39) have shown consistent demand levels (43, 87, 88, 76), averaging ~74 units, but including the full peak period since P30, the average is ~83. Given we are in mid-November, I expect this peak to continue. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory position: On-hand (63) + In-transit (258) = 321. With L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At 80 units/period, target inventory is ~400 units. Current pipeline (321) is slightly below this target. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the full autumn/winter peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time (4).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for sweatshirts (Top in soft sweatshirt fabric). Since Period 30, demand has been consistently high, with an average of approximately 80 units/week (P30-P40 mean \u2248 78.4). Recent periods (P37-P40) show very stable demand at 87, 88, 76, and 73 units respectively. As we approach late November and December, demand is expected to remain high or potentially increase further due to holiday shopping. On-hand inventory is 46, with a healthy pipeline of 276 units (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (P30-P40) to capture this specific peak regime while maintaining a high service level through sigma_hat, as stockouts in this period are costly in terms of lost profit.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand (Sept-Nov) has stabilized at a mean of ~78 units/week with moderate variance. The transition from autumn to winter has maintained these high levels consistently for 11 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is deep into the winter peak for sweatshirts. Demand has remained consistently high since Period 30 (September), with a mean of approximately 78 units over the last 11 periods. Period 41 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a small arrival (15 units) failing to meet demand (72 units). However, there are 331 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly reliable. To prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation focusing on the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this sustained high-demand regime (Sept-Nov). This will set a base stock level that accounts for roughly 78 units per week over the lead time + review period (5 weeks total).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike to 212 units, coinciding with late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), which significantly exceeded the previous 'high-season' mean of ~78 units. This resulted in a complete stockout. We are now in Period 43 (early December), where demand usually remains elevated due to holiday shopping but may moderate from the extreme Black Friday peak. The in-transit pipeline of 313 units covers roughly 4 weeks of demand at the previous high-season mean, but only about 1.5 weeks if the 212-unit spike represents a new temporary regime. Given the product is a 'soft sweatshirt', high demand is expected through December. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the entire autumn/winter high-season (starting P30) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will naturally weigh the recent spike into the forecast while maintaining the baseline for the holiday season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme seasonal demand spike observed in Period 42 (212 units), coinciding with Black Friday week. This is nearly 3x the previous high-season mean of 78.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday (P42 demand: 212) period, heading into the peak December holiday shopping season. Historical peak-season demand (Sept-Nov) averaged ~78 units/week. While demand in Period 43 returned to a 'normal' high-season level of 72, we must anticipate sustained elevated demand through December. Total lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the stable peak-season mean (~78), but slightly elevated to account for potential late-December surges and recent stockouts. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 14 periods (P30-P43) which define the current high-demand regime, excluding the abnormal Black Friday outlier if possible, but the OR backend's recent_N will include it, providing a healthy safety buffer for the holidays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the final weeks of the year, following a massive Black Friday spike (P42: 212 units). Historically, for this 'Top in soft sweatshirt fabric', high demand continues through December as winter intensifies. Recent demand (P44) was 105 units. Period 43 demand was 72. Excluding the extreme Black Friday outlier, the current high-season mean (P30-P44) is approximately 82 units. Since we are approaching the 'end of season' for the game (Period 47 concludes soon), inventory management must balance the high current demand against the risk of leftover stock at the end. Currently, on-hand is low (7), but 323 units are in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while including the recent volatility, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in November/December.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) remains elevated at ~90 units/week, consistent with peak winter seasonality for sweatshirts. Total in-transit (323) is high relative to the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 50, which is outside the game's horizon. The objective is to maximize profit minus holding cost for the remaining periods (46 and 47). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P44-P45) has been high (~108 units) following the holiday season. In-transit inventory is 375 units, consisting of orders from P42 (59), P43 (128), P44 (66), and P45 (122). Based on the 4-period lead time, the P42 order (59 units) will arrive during P46, and the P43 order (128 units) will arrive during P47. This total of 187 units arriving in the next two periods is expected to cover demand for this sweatshirt (estimated at ~80-110 units/period) while minimizing ending inventory. Since further orders will not arrive before the game ends, I will set parameters to stop new orders and rely on the existing pipeline to satisfy final demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, which is the final decision period of the simulation. Orders placed now arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4 lead time), but the game ends after Period 50 arrivals are resolved. Therefore, any order placed today will not affect sales performance within the scope of this simulation. With an on-hand inventory of 13 and a large pipeline (423 units) arriving in the next four periods (P48-P51), the objective shifts to minimizing terminal holding costs while ensuring enough stock is available for the very last demands. Historically, Period 48 and P49 will be the only remaining selling windows reachable by current stock or in-transit units. Given the pipeline is already over 400 units, the ending inventory will likely be very high. No further units are required.
