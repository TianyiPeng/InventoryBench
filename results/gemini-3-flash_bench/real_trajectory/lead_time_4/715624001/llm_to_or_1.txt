Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The Becka hoodie shows a significant demand surge in the last two weeks of historical data (January 28: 215 units, February 4: 302 units), up from an average of ~37 units in early January. This suggests a seasonal or trend-based regime shift. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand trend (53, 215, 302) while smoothing slightly. Promised lead time is 4; no history of arrivals yet to suggest deviations, so L='default'. Sigma will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Becka hoodie', a basic jersey item. Historical demand showed a significant upward trend from ~37 in early Jan to 302 on Feb 4. The demand in Period 1 (Feb 11) was 131, which is a drop from the previous week but still indicates a much higher regime than the initial Jan samples. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning demand went unmet in Period 1. There are 398 units in transit (ordered in P1) with a promised lead time of 4. Given the sharp increase in demand recently (moving from a mean of ~37 to ~302), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04), as the backend will include the latest demand of 131 in its calculation. This balances the recent peak with the moderate Period 1 result.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) is experiencing a significant demand surge. Historical data shows demand increasing from low double digits in early January (37, 22, 53) to much higher levels in late January and February (215, 302). Most recently, Periods 1 and 2 recorded a consistent demand of 131 units each, which is lower than the early February peak but substantially higher than the 2019-01-07/14 period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 4. Given the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (398 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and become observable in the Period 6 start message. To address the demand shift, I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the trend of the last three data points (302, 131, 131), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the sudden rise and the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected vs. early Jan: demand moved from avg ~37 to avg ~188 across the last 5 samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/04 (Period 4). The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time (L=4) means the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently in a stock-out phase as we wait for the pipeline to land. Demand history shows a significant shift from the low 30-50s in early January to a much higher level in late January and February (averaging ~163 over the last 5 historical samples: 215, 302, 131, 131, 76). However, the last three periods (after game start) show demand of 131, 131, and 76, suggesting the initial spike to 300 might have been an outlier or a short-lived peak. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~171) which balances the high late-January demand with the more moderate February levels. Lead time is kept at 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from L=4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The Becka hoodie (jersey basic/sweatshirt fabric) is entering the spring season. Historical demand shows a significant jump starting in late January (Period 27/28 in full context, specifically samples showing 215 and 302). Since game start, the recent 4 demand samples in history (concludes) are 131, 131, 76, 48. This suggests the initial spike from Jan/Feb is cooling off but remains significantly higher than the early Jan baseline (~37). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,181 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (398 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (current period), as Period 5 is P1 + L=4. However, we won't see this arrival in the 'conclude' message until Period 6. Based on the demand history provided (including the 302 in the final week of the provided samples), I will use logic that accounts for the higher recent demand regime. I will set L to 'default' (4) as we have seen zero concludes yet to prove otherwise. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the 2019-02-04 sample of 302 and the four game-conclude demands of 131, 131, 76, 48) to capture the current mean while smoothing the recent volatility. This ensures we maintain a safety buffer without over-ordering after the initial surge.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Becka hoodie', which typically sees strong demand in late winter and early spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 349 units, with 783 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Cumulative demand samples show a significant increase starting late Jan/early Feb. Recent weekly demand has stabilized around ~50 units (P3: 76, P4: 48, P5: 49) following a very high spike in Jan (P-2: 215, P-1: 302). Using a recent window (N=5) for demand captures this moderate level (average ~101 units) better than the long-term history which is skewed by the Jan outlier. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized after a Jan peak; current weekly demand is averaging ~60 units over the last 3 periods, down from the Jan surge (~250+). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The Becka hoodie (Jersey Basic sweatshirt) experienced a significant demand spike in late January/early February (peaking at ~302) but has settled into a lower, stable regime as we enter spring. Over the last three concluded periods (P4, P5, P6), demand has been 48, 49, and 51 units respectively (Average ~49). Current inventory is high: 655 on-hand plus 426 in-transit (ordered P3 and P4), totaling 1,081 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 arrival of P1 order, P6 arrival of P2 order). Given the stable demand around 50 units/week and the large inventory coverage (approx. 20 weeks), I will set \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this current regime using recent_N (N=3) to prevent over-ordering while the pipeline clears. This will naturally signal the OR backend to stop ordering since current pipeline (1,081) far exceeds the base stock target for a 49-unit/week demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~50 units/week for 3 consecutive periods following the Q1 surge. Inventory levels are now in a surplus state until the pipeline clears.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical data and recent game history show that after a significant surge in demand during late January and February (likely a seasonal peak for hoodies), demand has stabilized at a much lower level. For the last 4 periods (P4-P7), demand has consistently hovered around 50 units (48, 49, 51, 49). Current on-hand inventory is 957 units, which is extremely high relative to the current demand rate of ~50/week. Additionally, 75 units (ordered in P4) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P8, bringing total availability to over 1000 units. Given that the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through P1, P2, and P3 arrivals, and our current stock covers approximately 20 weeks of demand, the goal for the OR backend is to stop ordering. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 4-5 samples will accurately reflect the low-demand regime and prevent unnecessary replenishment while we bleed off the current surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. The 'Becka hoodie' (a sweatshirt/jersey item) saw a significant surge in late January/early February, but demand has consistently stabilized at approximately 50 units per week over the last five periods (P4-P8 demand: 48, 49, 51, 49, 52). Lead time is confirmed and stable at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of all four orders placed between P1 and P4. Current on-hand inventory is 980 units, which represents approximately 19-20 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There are no units in-transit. Given the high stock level relative to the steady demand of ~50/week and the holding cost of $1/unit/period, the focus is on preventing further overstocking. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current stable regime (N=5) and L to 4. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively halting new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~50 units/week (last 5 periods avg: 49.8) following the initial Q1 surge. Inventory levels are high (980 units), providing nearly 20 weeks of coverage.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The 'Becka hoodie' is a basic jersey item that experienced a significant demand surge in late January (orders placed in P1-P3 reached over 300 units). However, demand has since stabilized and remains extremely consistent. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has been 49, 51, 49, 52, and 51 units respectively (Average: 50.4, Standard Deviation: 1.3). The current on-hand inventory is 929 units, which at the current burn rate of ~50 units/period, provides approximately 18 weeks of coverage. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and stable demand, the priority is to avoid further ordering while maintaining a realistic forecast for the OR backend. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this new stable regime for both mean and variance, and use the calculate method for lead time as it has proven to be consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has significantly cooled following the Q1 surge. The last demand observation (Period 10) was 19 units, significantly lower than the previous 5-period average of ~50. hoodies typically see lower demand as spring transitions into summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Current on-hand inventory is 910 units, which at the current stabilized demand rate (~40-50 units/week) provides over 18 weeks of coverage. No new orders are needed as we are in a heavy surplus state. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent post-surge stabilization and the recent dip (Periods 7-10), ensuring the base_stock calculation remains low to prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease shift detected at Period 10: demand dropped to 19 units, bringing the 4-period average to ~43, down from the previous ~50 unit baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is the Becka hoodie. Demand has shown a recent shift: after stabilizing around 50 units/week, we saw a dip to 19 (Period 10) followed by a spike to 87 (Period 11). The average of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 51.6 units, which is consistent with the long-term post-Jan stabilization. On-hand inventory is very high at 823 units, while weekly demand is ~50 units, meaning we have approximately 16 weeks of coverage. There are no units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To prevent further unnecessary stock accumulation while high inventory is cleared, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime, and maintain the default lead time (4) and sigma_hat calculations. The OR backend will naturally order 0 units because the current inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) is entering May (Period 13). Recent demand has shown a significant upward trend (Period 11: 87 units, Period 12: 129 units), moving away from the April low of 19. The last 4 periods average ~71.5 units, but the most recent 2 periods average 108 units. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is very high at 694 units, which covers approximately 6-10 weeks of demand at current rates. No shipments are in transit. I am setting L to default (4 periods) as lead times have been consistent. To reflect the recent demand surge and prevent the OR engine from being too conservative based on the April lull, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (avg ~78), which balances the sudden jump with the previous data. Sigma_hat is set to the last 5 samples to capture the increased volatility (19 to 129). Given the high on-hand stock, the OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate for reducing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April/early May: demand jumped from 19 to 129 over 3 periods, suggesting a potential late-spring spike or promotion effect.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is the 'Becka hoodie', which saw a significant late-spring demand increase starting around Period 11 (moving from an average of ~50 to an average of ~88.5 over the last 4 periods). The most recent demand was 70. On-hand inventory is 556 units with 77 units in-transit (total 633). Given the lead time (L=4) and next review period, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. At the current 4-period average of ~88.5, expected demand over the lead time is ~442 units. Our current inventory position (633) provides sufficient coverage for roughly 7 periods at this rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P1, P2, P3, P4 all arrived with L=4). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the increased demand trend of the last month, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility (19 to 129 jump).

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand lift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~50 to ~88 over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), a roughly 75% increase vs. the March/April baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing the 'Becka hoodie'. Current on-hand inventory is 474 units with 77 units in-transit. Demand has transitioned from a stable spring baseline (~50 units/week) into a higher late-spring regime. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 87, 129, 68, 70, and 82, averaging 87.2 units per week. This aligns with the 'late-spring demand lift' noted in the Period 15 carry-over insight. Given the current inventory (474 units) and recent average (87.2), we have approximately 5.4 weeks of coverage. With a promised and confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory (OH+IT = 551) covers roughly 6.3 weeks of demand. To capture this recent shift while smoothing for the volatility (e.g., the P12 spike to 129), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the new regime) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance in the new demand pattern. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~87 unit/week level rather than the previous ~50 unit/week period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is the Becka hoodie, which has recently seen a sustained lift in demand compared to the March/April baseline of ~50 units. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the demand has averaged approximately 83.3 units (87, 129, 68, 70, 82, 64), confirming the 'late-spring demand lift' identified in Period 15. The current on-hand inventory is 410 units, and there are 77 units in-transit (ordered in P14, expected to arrive in P18 based on the stable lead time of 4 periods). This total pipeline of 487 units provides approximately 5.8 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate of ~83 units/week. Since the decision for Period 17 must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and the pipeline of 487 covers the expected 415 units (5 * 83), the current inventory position is adequate but nearing the point where new orders will be triggered by the OR backend. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility while ignoring the early-year stock-out and surge phases.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we are managing the 'Becka hoodie'. Demand has softened from the late-spring peak (approx. 88 units/week) back to a lower level (last 5 periods avg: 66.4). The most recent period (P17) showed a demand of 48. On-hand inventory is 362 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate, and there are 96 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the product type (hoodie) and the date (mid-June), we expect demand to remain low or continue to decrease as summer begins. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining service level (profit $19/unit), I will set the demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current cooling trend. Lead time and sigma will remain on recent and calculated settings respectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: demand has cooled from the late-spring surge (~88 units) back to a lower level, averaging ~66 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), the SKU 'Becka hoodie' is experiencing a post-spring cooling phase. Recent demand samples (P15-P18: 82, 64, 48, 58) show a mean of 63, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 18 stating a cooling trend to ~66 units. This is a significant drop from the May surge (~88 units). On-hand inventory is 381 units with 19 units in-transit (total 400). Given the current demand mean of ~63, the 400 units provide approximately 6.3 weeks of coverage, which is greater than the necessary (L+1) window of 5 weeks. Since inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time plus review period, the OR backend will naturally order very little or zero, but I will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime to ensure the safety stock calculation is accurate should a deficit occur. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current cooling trend.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we observe that demand for the Becka hoodie has slowed significantly. The most recent demand was 18 units, following a cooling trend noted in the Carry-over Insights (averaging ~66 units in P13-P17). The last 3 periods (P17-P19) show demand of 48, 58, and 18, averaging 41.3 units/period. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. With 363 units on-hand and only 19 in-transit, we current have nearly 9 periods of coverage at current demand levels. I will set mu_hat to capture the last 5 periods (P15-P19) to reflect this cooling trend while accounting for recent volatility (mean ~54 for N=5). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current variability. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to demand, the OR engine is unlikely to place a new order this period, which is appropriate for managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand cooling confirmed in late June: 3-period average dropped to ~41 units (P17-P19), down from the late-spring surge of ~88 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has significantly cooled over the last three periods (P18-P20), with weekly readings of 58, 18, and 19 units, bringing the 3-period average to 31.7 units. This follows a late-spring surge and confirms a downward shift as we enter the summer season, which is seasonally expected for sweatshirt products. On-hand inventory is currently 344 units, with 19 units in-transit (due to arrive in Period 21). Total inventory (363) covers approximately 11 weeks of current demand, well above the 5-period (L+1) planning horizon. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory surplus and the low-demand summer season, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling (averaging the last 4 periods, which include the start of the decline) to prevent unnecessary ordering and allow inventory levels to naturally deplete.

The Becka Hoodie is currently in a seasonally low-demand period (summer), though Period 21 saw a significant spike to 104 units, likely due to a July 4th related promotion or early 'back-to-school' interest. Looking at the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand averaged 49.4 units, maintaining the general stability around 50 units despite some high volatility (\u03c3 is high due to the 104 and 18/19 unit swings). The current on-hand inventory is 259 units, which covers over 5 periods of average demand (approx. 5.2 periods), aligning closely with the L+1 (5 period) requirement for lead time coverage. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent spike without over-adjusting, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P17 order arriving in P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Becka hoodie (long-sleeved sweatshirt) is experiencing a significant demand surge in July (Period 21: 104, Period 22: 201). This pattern likely reflects a 'back-to-school' early-season build or a summer clearance event, contrasting sharply with the June average of ~41. The last 3 periods (P20-P22) average 108 units/week, while the last 5 periods average 89 units/week. Given the trend's verticality (19 -> 104 -> 201), I will use the last 3 samples to forecast near-term demand to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. On-hand inventory is low (58) and the pipeline (108 units from P22) won't arrive until Period 26 (L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P17 order arriving in P21. Parameters are set to capture this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected in July: demand increased from an average of ~41 in June to 152 over the last two weeks (P21-P22), representing a ~270% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24 (July 22). The 'Becka hoodie' is experiencing a sharp July surge. Demand in Period 22 was 201 and Period 23 was 199, averaging 200 units/week over the last two weeks. This is a massive increase from the June average of ~41. We ran out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) and lost significant sales in Period 23 (demand 199, sales 58). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 21 arrival. Since the current demand surge is significant (regime shift), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current weekly average of ~168 (including the transition) rather than the long-term average, ensuring the base stock level targets the current high-demand environment (~840 units for L+1). This will trigger orders to replenish the pipeline and address the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average demand for July (P21-P23) is ~168 units/week, a ~300% increase compared to June (~41 units/week). Stockout occurred in Period 23 due to this rapid shift.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (hoodie) is experiencing a significant mid-summer demand surge starting in Period 22 (~200 units/week), likely due to back-to-school preparations or early autumn transitions. There was a stockout in Period 23 and Period 24 as the previous low-demand regime (~40 units/week) was insufficient. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand dropped to 66 in Period 24, but this is likely an outlier within the surge regime or reflecting limited sales potential while stock was zero. To recover and prevent further lost sales during the lead time (4 periods), I am setting mu_hat to capture the recent surge. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to incorporate the surge levels (201, 199, 66) plus the period just before it (104), resulting in an average mu close to the high-demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed starting Period 22: Demand shifted from ~40 to ~160+ units/week, likely seasonal (Back-to-School).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Becka hoodie', which is experiencing a significant demand surge in July and early August, likely due to a 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak. Demand spiked from ~40 units/week in June to an average of ~144 units/week over the last 4 periods (P22-P25: 201, 199, 66, 110). Although there was a dip in P24 (66), the overall trend remains elevated compared to the spring baseline. We are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory, while 881 units are in-transit. These in-transit units include large orders from P22 (108), P23 (258), P24 (260), and P25 (255). The first large arrival (from P22) is expected in Period 26. Since the demand regime has shifted to a higher state, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the summer surge. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this period. Lead time remains stable at the default 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Becka hoodie', which is currently entering its peak seasonal window (August/September) as part of the 'Back-to-School' and 'Fall' transition. We are currently experiencing a significant stockout phase because demand surged from ~40 units in June to an average of ~150+ units in July and August (P21-P26: 104, 201, 199, 66, 110, 208). The low demand in P24-P25 was due to stockouts affecting visibility, but P26 saw a demand of 208 when 108 units arrived, resulting in immediate depletion. To handle this, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the high-regime demand (~138 units/period, or ~690 for the 1+L window). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P22 order arriving in P26.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Fall demand surge confirmed: Demand has shifted from a ~40/week baseline to a ~150/week baseline starting mid-July (P22). Stockouts have occurred consistently since P23 due to this rapid shift.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand for SKU 715624001 (Becka Hoodie) shows a significant seasonal surge starting in July (Period 22), coinciding with the Back-to-School season. Recent demand samples are 201(P22), 199(P23), 66(P24), 110(P25), 208(P26), and 322(P27). The drop in Periods 24-25 was likely due to stockouts masking true demand (sold=0), but the arrivals in P26 and P27 confirm high activity (demand=208 and 322 respectively). The 3-period average of demand (P25-P27) is ~213 units, but P27 alone was 322. Given the product category (Hoodie) and the late August date, we are entering peak Fall seasonality. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to catch this momentum, while acknowledging that Period 24-25 demand might be understated due to stockout-related data noise. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 765, the OR engine needs to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand (~1000-1100 units).

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-School demand peak intensified in mid-August: Period 27 demand reached 322 units, a 50% increase over the previous July peak (~200 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) is experiencing a Fall/Back-to-School demand surge. Current date is late August (2019/8/26). While demand peaked at 322 units in Period 27, it dropped to 83 units in Period 28. However, historical samples from earlier in the year (Jan/Feb) and the nature of hoodies suggest sustained high demand as cooler weather approaches. The last 7 periods (P22-P28) show a mean demand of ~170 units, but with significant volatility (std ~95). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline currently has 865 units in transit, and on-hand is 177. To prevent further stockouts seen in P23-P27 while accounting for the recent high volatility and the hoodie's seasonal relevance, I will use a 7-period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while the OR backend calculates the appropriate safety stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge volatility: demand fluctuated from 322 (P27) to 83 (P28), averaging ~170 units/week over the last 7 weeks. Seasonal relevance (hoodie) suggests sustained interest into September.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. The product (hoodie) is entering its core seasonal period (Fall). Demand over the last 8 periods (since P22) has averaged 146.5 units, though it has been volatile with a peak of 322 (P27) and lower values of 83 (P28) and 63 (P29). The recent dips in P28-P29 likely reflect stabilization after the initial Back-to-School rush rather than a collapse in demand, as weather typically cools in September/October, favoring hoodie sales. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this 'elevated fall' regime while smoothing out the extreme P27 peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand plus pipeline (369 + 748 = 1117) currently covers approximately 7.6 weeks of demand at the 146.5 rate; the OR backend will calculate the necessary replenishment to maintain service levels for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-School demand regime (P22-P29) averaging ~146 units/week, characterized by high volatility (std dev ~95).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences high demand during the Fall/Back-to-School season. We have observed a significant demand regime since Period 22 (~mid-July), averaging approximately 146 units/week with considerable volatility (ranging from 63 to 322 units). The last three weeks show demand of 83, 63, and 97, suggesting the initial August peak of 322 may have leveled off, but seasonal relevance remains high as we enter September. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 358 units with 664 units in-transit. I will use a recent N (N=9, covering the shift since P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility Fall regime without being overly skewed by the single massive spike in Period 27 or the low June baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) is entering mid-September (2019/09/16). Historically, we saw a massive surge in demand starting mid-July (P22) peaking at 322 units in P27. However, the last four periods (P28-P31) have shown a significant downward trend: 83, 63, 97, and 17 units respectively (mean = 65.0). This suggests the 'Back-to-School' peak has passed, and we are entering a post-peak autumn regime. Currently, we have 505 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit (orders from P28-P31), totaling 1055 units of pipeline inventory. Given the local average of ~65 units/week, this covers over 16 weeks of demand. To prevent excessive holding costs as demand cools, I am lowering mu_hat using a recent_N (N=4) approach to reflect the recent deceleration while maintaining the default lead time (confirmed at 4 periods). This will likely result in zero or minimal new orders until the existing stock is absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling detected at Period 32: Demand has dropped from a peak of 322 (P27) to an average of 65 units/week over the last 4 periods (P28-P31), indicating the end of the Back-to-School surge.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Becka hoodie has clearly entered a post-peak cooling phase following the Back-to-School surge (late July - August). Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged approximately 58.8 units (83, 63, 97, 17, 34), a significant reduction from the earlier peak of 322. Current on-hand inventory is high at 831 units, with an additional 190 units in transit (138 from P29, 2 from P30, and 50 from P31). Total pipeline and on-hand inventory (1021 units) covers more than 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (~60/week), leading to a surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the post-peak trend) and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the recent volatility drop. This will signal the OR engine to pause ordering until the inventory position normalizes against the new lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from a peak of 322 (P27) to an average of ~59 units/week over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). Inventory is currently in a surplus state (1000+ units vs ~60/week demand).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Becka hoodie, which saw a significant demand surge during the mid-July to August 'Back-to-School' period (peaking at 322 units in Period 27). However, demand has cooled significantly in September. The last six periods (P28-P33) show demand values of 83, 63, 97, 17, 34, and 84, averaging approximately 63 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 885 units, which provides over 14 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the surplus inventory and high holding costs relative to current sales, the OR parameters should reflect this lower demand regime to prevent unnecessary ordering. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this post-peak stabilization.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has transitioned out of the significant Back-to-School/Late-Summer peak (which reached 322 units in Period 27/mid-August) into a post-peak cooling phase. Over the last 7 periods (P28-P34), demand has averaged 68.4 units, with the most recent sample at 98 units. Inventory is currently high (789 on-hand + 50 in-transit = 839 total), providing approximately 12 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. There is a clear regime shift from the volatile August peak (~146 units/week average) to a more moderate Fall level (~68 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory surplus and lower current demand, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization, ensuring the OR backend avoids over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for the Fall season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling regime confirmed (P28-P34): Mean demand dropped from ~146 to ~68 units/week (-53%) following the Back-to-School surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1781.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences a secondary demand surge during the fall and winter months. While previous insights noted a post-back-to-school cooling (averaging ~68 units between P28-P34), demand in P35 jumped to 131, suggesting the onset of colder-weather demand. On-hand inventory is currently high at 708 units, which covers approximately 5-7 weeks of demand at the new observed level (131). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand balance and the OR engine's objective to balance service levels against holding costs, I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect the recent uptick (N=4 to capture the shift from the ~60s toward the 100+ range) and use standard calculations for lead time and sigma. Since pipeline inventory is now 0 and on-hand is 708, the OR engine will naturally suppress ordering until the surplus is consumed, while the higher mu_hat will protect the service level as we head deeper into Q4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand cooling from Back-to-School ended; Period 35 demand (131) indicates the start of a late-autumn cold-weather regime (up from ~68 average).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has transitioned from a post-Back-to-School cooling phase into a late-autumn cold-weather regime. Demand in the last two periods (P35: 131, P36: 117) shows a clear and sustained increase from the previous baseline of ~68. This align with seasonal expectations for hoodies in late October. The current average over the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is approximately 115 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 591, and there is no pipeline inventory remaining. Given a total review+lead time of 5 periods (L=4), 591 units provide approximately 5.1 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. While inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time window, the OR backend's base-stock target (balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) will likely trigger a small replenishment order to maintain the desired service level as we head deeper into the autumn/winter season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this new sustained demand level (avg ~115), and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the transitioning volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: mean demand increased from ~68 to ~115 units/week (+69%) over the last 3 samples, consistent with seasonal hoodie demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) is in a late-autumn demand regime. As specifically noted in carry-over insights for Periods 36 and 37, demand has shifted upwards from the post-back-to-school slump (~68 units) to a higher level. The most recent three periods (P35-P37) show demands of 131, 117, and 160, averaging approximately 136 units per week. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a hoodie as temperatures drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 431 units, and 154 units are in transit (ordered P37), totaling 585 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 680 units). Our current pipeline (585) is slightly below the required base stock for this regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent seasonal lift (136 * 5 = 680), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn hoodie demand regime is sustained: the 3-period average (P35-P37) is ~136 units/week, significantly higher than the previous September baseline of ~68 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a late-autumn cold-weather regime for the Becka hoodie. Over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has been 131, 117, 160, and 93, averaging approximately 125 units per week. This is significantly higher than the September post-Back-to-School lull (~68 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31-P35 results confirm L=4). Although on-hand inventory (338) and in-transit (327) provide some coverage, current demand trajectories (125/week) suggest a requirement of ~625 units for a 5-period horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this sustained autumn lift, while maintaining a default lead time of 4. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will allow the OR engine to account for the current volatility (std dev ~28) in this seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn hoodie demand regime (started P35) confirmed stable: 4-period average (P35-P38) is 125 units/week vs 68 units/week in Sept/early Oct.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late-autumn season for the 'Becka hoodie'. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 35 (early October), with the last 5 periods (P35-P39) showing an average demand of 116.4 units/week. This aligns with seasonal expectations for cold-weather apparel. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P31 order arriving P35). We have 257 units on-hand and 392 in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39). Using a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this seasonal elevated demand while smoothing recent weekly fluctuations (range 81-160). The OR backend's inventory target will account for the current pipeline and ensure we maintain stock through the remainder of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn hoodie demand regime (P35-P39) stabilized at an average of ~116 units/week, up significantly from the September average of ~68.

This align with the product category (hoodie) and the mid-November date. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 153 and 441 units in-transit (ordered P37-P40), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized higher demand baseline, while maintaining the default sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in this product category.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. The product is a hoodie, which enters a peak seasonal demand period in late autumn/early winter. Recent demand (P35-P41) has averaged 111.5 units per week, significantly higher than the September average of ~68. The current on-hand inventory is 212, with 516 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). To prepare for potential December/Holiday demand increases for this 'Jersey Basic' hoodie, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current late-autumn regime. L is set to calculate and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to account for recent demand volatility (~25 units). The OR engine will use these to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 560 units (5 * 112) of pipeline demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn hoodie demand regime (starting P35) confirmed sustained through November: 7-period average (P35-P41) is ~112 units/week, up from ~68 in September (+65%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. The product is a hoodie, entering the peak winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has been stable in a 'Late-autumn' regime since Period 35, with recent demand averaging 112 units/week (P35-P42). However, looking at the last 3 periods (P40-P42), demand is 104, 95, and 148, showing a slight upward tick as December begins. Historically, we saw a massive surge in late January (P4), but current seasonal context suggests sustained or increasing demand through the holiday season. The pipeline is healthy with 343 units in transit, following a consistent 4-period lead time. To maintain high service levels (Target Service Level ~95% given Profit $19/Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (the 'hoodie season' starting P35) to capture the current mean of ~112 units/week. sigma_hat is also set to the recent 8-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: December/Winter regime shift: Starting P42 (late Nov/early Dec), demand increased to 148 (+32% vs previous 7-period avg), likely reflecting holiday season demand for winter apparel.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). The current demand context reflects a transition into the peak winter/holiday season for this hoodie product. Period 43 demand was 65, which is lower than the previous week's 148, but the general trend since Period 35 shows a sustained late-autumn/winter regime. The 4-period average (P40-P43) is approximately 103 units. Given the seasonal nature of a hoodie in December, I anticipate demand will remain elevated or potentially spike further as the holiday peak approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 237, with 382 units in transit (orders from P40, P41, and P43). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current December regime (avg ~103) while maintaining a buffer for volatility. I will use the default lead time (4) as it has been consistent.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday shopping period (2019/12/16). Demand for the Becka hoodie, a seasonal sweatshirt product, is currently in a sustained 'winter regime' that began around Period 42. Over the last three periods (P42-P44), demand has averaged approximately 101 units per week (148, 65, 90). While the most recent week saw 90 units, the overall winter baseline remains higher than the early autumn average of ~68. Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently healthy with 196 units on-hand and 382 units in-transit. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the winter shift while buffering against holiday volatility, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the moderate seasonal variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4235.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The product is a hoodie, which is in peak seasonal demand during winter. Period 45 demand spiked significantly to 233 units (up from ~90 the previous week), confirming a late-December/Holiday surge. This surge has depleted the on-hand inventory to 192 units. There is an in-transit pipeline of 189 units (orders from P42 to P45). With the promised lead time of 4 periods consistently being met, I need to ensure the base stock covers a 5-period window (Review + Lead Time). I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this high-demand holiday regime, using a forecast of approximately 160 units per week (blending the recent spike with the December trend), and keep sigma_hat high to protect against the observed volatility (233 units peak). Lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Winter Peak Surge: Demand spiked significantly in Period 45 to 233 units, following a stable Dec average of ~90. This indicates a high-intensity seasonal peak for hoodies in late December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the end-of-year holiday peak into Jan. Demand in P45 (233) and P46 (214) confirmed a major seasonal surge for single-SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie). We are currently stocked out on-hand (0 units) but have a healthy pipeline of 460 units (104 ordered P43, 49 P44, 36 P45, and 271 P46). Expected arrivals for P47 are the 104 units ordered in P43 (L=4). Demand typically cools slightly in January after the Christmas/New Year peak but remains significant due to the cold season. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P44-P46, avg ~179) to capture the high-intensity winter demand while expecting the OR logic to cover the L+1 period lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same recent period to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~77). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak intensity confirmed: P45-P46 demand averaged 223.5 units (+100% vs early Dec baseline). Stockout occurred in P46 due to this surge.
