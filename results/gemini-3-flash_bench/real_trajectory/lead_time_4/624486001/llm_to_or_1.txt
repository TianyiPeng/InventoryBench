Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory for SKU 624486001 (Brit Baby Tee). The product is a short, fitted cotton tee, which typically sees rising demand as we move into the spring months. The historical data (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows a clear upward trend: 55, 60, 66, 88, 108. This suggests a transition from winter to spring demand regimes. The mean of these 5 samples is 75.4, but the most recent sample is 108, indicating we should weight recent observations more heavily. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent acceleration (mean of last 3: 87.3) while allowing the OR engine to calculate the safety stock based on recent volatility. Promised lead time is 4, so planning horizon is 5 periods. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the OR engine, though the capping mechanism will assist in inventory control.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a seasonal fashion item. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 55, 60, 66, 88, 108, and most recently 98 in Period 1 (total 6 samples). The average demand over the last 3 weeks is 98 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no shipments arrived yet (as expected given L=4), I will use the promised lead time for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~98) while the OR backend multiplies this by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand is showing a strong upward trend: 55, 60, 66, 88, 108 in pre-game samples, followed by 98 and 162 in Periods 1 and 2. This represents a significant demand acceleration, likely due to the product (Brit Baby Tee/Short fitted top) entering the spring season. Current inventory is 0 with 237 units in transit (122 from P1, 115 from P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5. Based on the recent samples (88, 108, 98, 162), the average demand is approximately 114 units/period. To avoid stockouts once lead-time arrivals begin, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this higher demand regime. Given the high volatility (162 vs 98), I am using a recent_N=4 for sigma_hat as well to provide a higher safety stock buffer.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are selling a 'Brit Baby Tee', which is a 'Short, fitted top'\u2014a classic early-spring seasonal item. Demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical samples (which averaged ~75 units), showing a clear regime shift: P1=98, P2=162, P3=134 (mean ~131). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (Resolution Phase), so we haven't seen any arrivals yet. Currently, we have 406 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, leading to 100% lost sales so far. To capture the current upward trend and seasonal nature, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility calculation. L will stay at the promised default of 4. Since the OR engine calculates base stock as (1+L)*mu, using N=3 will target approximately (1+4)*131 = 655 units of total pipeline inventory, which is appropriate given the current 406 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: average weekly demand increased from historical ~75 to ~131 units (+75%) as spring seasonality begins for short-sleeved tops.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', which is a short-sleeved top, naturally seeing increased demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (late Jan/early Feb) averaged ~75, but since Period 1, observed demand has been 98, 162, 134, and 111, averaging ~126.25 units per week. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift. Regarding lead time, the promised L=4. We placed our first order in Period 1; per the logic, an order with L=4 placed in P1 arrives during P5 (now) and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message seen at the start of P6. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 591 units in-transit (P1: 122, P2: 115, P3: 169, P4: 185). Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we stick to the promised Lead Time (L=4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher spring demand (average 126.25) across the review and lead period (1+4=5 weeks). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the current volatility (std dev ~26.6).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', which is a short-sleeved top showing clear upward demand trends as we approach spring. Historical demand since Period 1 has averaged 125.6 units (98, 162, 134, 111, 123), significantly higher than the pre-period samples (avg ~75). Period 5 confirms the promised lead time (L=4) as the Period 1 order arrived exactly in 4 periods. However, we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) despite the Period 5 arrival, indicating we are under-ordered for this new demand regime. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 510 units, consisting of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. We need to maintain a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.5, but biased towards available stock as demand is rising). I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current spring regime and default for lead time (L=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th (Period 7). The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Since Period 1, demand has averaged 135 units/period (98, 162, 134, 111, 123, 182), significantly higher than the pre-February historical average (~75). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in P5 and P6 exceeded available stock, resulting in lost sales. Total in-transit inventory is 513 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), with P3's order (169 units) expected to arrive during P7. To capture the full demand and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods' mean (~135 * 5 = 675) and maintaining recent volatility (sigma_hat) for a better safety stock buffer. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods align with observations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee', which is seeing a seasonal demand increase as we enter spring. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 111, 123, 182, 205) shows a clear upward trend, with the average of the last 4 periods being 155.25. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 506 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). To account for the accelerating demand and the high risk of stockouts (ending on-hand has been 0 for 3 consecutive periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~155 units/week across 5 periods = 776). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead times have been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Mean weekly demand increased from ~120 in early March to ~193 in late March (+60%) as spring seasonality for short-sleeved tops intensifies.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved top), which is currently in a strong upward seasonal trend as spring progresses. Demand has accelerated significantly: early samples (Period 1-4) averaged ~126, while the most recent 4 periods (Period 5-8) averaged ~183, with the latest period hitting 221. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand is consistently exceeding supply arrivals. Shipments (P1-P4) have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since L=4, the base stock must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) reflects the current higher-demand regime (~183/week * 5 weeks = 915). Given the accelerating trend and seasonality, I will keep sigma_hat based on the same recent regime to account for increased volatility at higher volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a short-sleeved top, which is seeing peak spring demand. Demand analysis: Demand has significantly increased, averaging 198 units/period over the last 4 periods (P6-P9: 182, 205, 221, 186). Our inventory position is extremely tight; we have 0 on-hand and have been consistently selling out our entire arrival volume. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 4-week average of ~198, the target mu_hat should be approximately 990. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand spring regime while maintaining the promised lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved top), which is currently in its peak spring season (late April). Historical demand data and carry-over insights show a significant shift: from roughly 75 units/week pre-Period 1 to ~131 units (Periods 1-4) and then accelerating to an average of ~200 units/week from Period 7 onwards. The demand in the last four periods (Periods 7, 8, 9, 10) was 205, 221, 186, and 206, yielding an average of 204.5 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10). With current on-hand inventory at 0 and a high demand regime, I am setting L to default (4) and using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current weekly average of ~205. For sigma_hat, N=4 will also be used to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (1+L) = 5 periods of this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~205 units/week starting Period 7 (evidence: P7-P10 avg = 204.5), confirming sustained peak spring interest for short-sleeved tops.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is a baby tee (short-sleeved top), which is seeing peak seasonal demand. Historical demand has transitioned from ~130 in early March to ~205 in late March/early April, and the most recent demand (Period 11) spiked to 267. This suggests a continued upward trend as late spring/early summer approaches. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 861 units in-transit. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (arrived as scheduled). To capture the recent spike and seasonal momentum, I will use a recent_N window for both demand and lead time. For mu_hat, N=4 covers the transition to the current higher demand level (Avg P8-P11 = 220). For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the recent volatility. The L parameter remains 'default' (4) which matches observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in late April (Period 11: 267 units), suggesting a transition from the previous stable ~205 level to a higher peak summer regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/05/06), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved top). Historical demand shows a transition from ~205 units/week in late March/early April to an average of ~248 units/week over the last two periods (P11-P12). The most recent demand (P12) was 229, following a spike of 267. Actual lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P8 order arrived on P12). On-hand inventory is nearly zero (1 unit), but there are 870 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12), which is consistent with our pipeline covering the L+1 window. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this high-demand summer regime (approx. 235 units/week), and set sigma_hat using the same window to capture the increased volatility seen in the transition (267 to 229). Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 4 as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted to peak summer levels starting Period 11, with mean weekly demand rising to approximately 240 units (+17% from the previous 205 level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows significant volatility: Period 11 saw a peak of 267 units, while Period 13 dropped sharply to 128 units. However, this drop may be an anomaly compared to the established summer trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is roughly 208, while the average since the transition to peak summer (P11) is 240. I will prioritize the more recent data (N=3) to set mu_hat, reflecting the possible cooling from the April spike while staying above historical lows. Lead time is stable at 4 periods across all concluded orders (P5-P13). On-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 901 (covering Period 10, 11, 12, 13 orders). The total pipeline plus on-hand (1028) is being checked against demand for the (L+1)=5 period window. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the current volatility best.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a short-sleeved top in jersey cotton, which is highly seasonal for the spring and summer months (May/June). Current date is May 20th. Historical demand shows a significant increase from ~75 units in February to over 200 units in April/May. However, the last two periods (P13: 128, P14: 171) show a cooling off from the late-April peak (P11: 267). This suggests the initial spring surge has stabilized into a summer baseline. Given on-hand inventory of 185 and in-transit units of 684 (covering orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), the pipeline is quite full. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by all previous arrivals (P1 through P10 orders). I will use a recent window (N=4) to set mu_hat, capturing the transition from the peak (267) to the recent moderation (171), resulting in a mean weekly forecast of ~199 units. Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5 * 199 = 995. Sigma_hat will also use the recent N=4 window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in mid-May (P13-14 avg: 149.5) compared to the late-April peak (P11-12 avg: 248), suggesting the summer baseline for this SKU is lower than the initial seasonal surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed cotton jersey) is currently in a post-peak summer regime. After a demand surge at the end of April (reaching 267 units), demand moderated and stabilized in May. The last three periods (P13, P14, P15) recorded demand of 128, 171, and 178 respectively, averaging ~159 units per week. This represents a significant drop from the peak levels of 220-260 units. I am setting N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this most recent baseline (avg ~159, std ~27) and avoid over-ordering based on the April peak. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P11 arrived P15). Pipeline is currently full (661 units), which at current demand levels (~159/week) covers over 4 weeks of inventory, so the OR backend should naturally moderate new orders to reduce holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a post-peak baseline in late May (P13-P15 avg: 159), significantly lower than the April peak (~240).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed top) is now in the early summer period (June 3). Demand has stabilized at a post-peak level. Recent demand history shows: P13=128, P14=171, P15=178, P16=239. The average of the last 4 periods is 179 units. While P16 saw a jump to 239, this aligns with the start of warmer June weather, but is still significantly lower than the April peak of 267. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (50%), favoring lean inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-spring moderation while acknowledging the recent uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved top) has moved from its peak spring demand (April) into a more stabilized early summer regime. Recent weekly demand samples (P13-P17) are 128, 171, 178, 239, and 199. This yields a recent 5-period average of 183 units/week. While the previous carry-over insight noted a stabilization around 159, the last two weeks (239 and 199) suggest the summer 'floor' is slightly higher, centered around 180-200. Lead times remain perfectly stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 241 and a pipeline (in-transit) of 392, total coverage is 633 units. Against a projected demand of 183 units/week over the L+1 window (5 periods), the total requirement is approximately 915 units. To bridge this gap, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current summer baseline and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the recent rise in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized into a summer baseline starting Period 13: mean weekly demand is approximately 183 units (based on P13-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is in its peak summer season. I have identified a stable summer demand regime since Period 13 (mid-May). The demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) has been [171, 178, 239, 199, 151], resulting in an average of 187.6 units per week. This aligns with the previous core insight of ~183 units/week. Lead times remain consistent at the promised 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 102 and a large pipeline (630 units in-transit), I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of the identified summer baseline (starting P13) while smoothing recent volatility. The parameters will target approximately 938 units (5 * 187.6) as the base stock level, moderated by the OR backend's safety stock calculation z*sigma.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The item is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved top), currently in its peak summer season. Looking at the demand history since Period 13 (the identified post-peak regime start), demand has been: 128, 171, 178, 239, 199, 151, 197. The average for these 7 periods is approximately 180.4. Recent demand (P16-P19) has consistently been near or above 190 (except for P18). I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized summer baseline (approx 180 units/week). Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods (P5-P19), so I will use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 662) plus On-hand (30) equals 692, which covers roughly 3.8 weeks of demand at the 180 rate; given the 4-period lead time, the OR backend will likely place a replenishment order to maintain the desired service level (calculated as q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, though the backend applies a z-score which generally ensures higher availability).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21 (2019/7/1). Analyzing the history, Period 20 conclude shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory is now 0. Looking at the ordering history, Period 16 was a 'skip' (ordered=0). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the shipment from Period 16 (0 units) would have arrived in Period 20, explaining the zero arrival. The next shipment (from Period 17, 255 units) is expected to arrive during Period 21. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 13; the average demand from Period 13 to Period 20 is approximately 186.6 units per week. The current date (July 1st) is peak summer, which aligns with sustained demand for a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed top). Since on-hand is 0 and we faced a stockout in Period 20 (sold 30 of 196 demand), I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable regime (N=8, covering P13-P20) to ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the ~187 unit/week average. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: Average weekly demand from Period 13 to Period 20 is 186 units, representing a stable post-spring regime for this SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (2019/7/8), managing a short-sleeved baby tee. Analysis of the game history from Period 13 through Period 21 shows a stable summer demand regime with an average of approximately 186 units per week (P13-P21 avg = 186.1). The most recent observation (Period 21) shows demand of 172 units, consistent with this baseline. Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals on Periods 17, 18, 19, and 21). Note that Period 20's conclusion message did not show an arrival because the order from Period 16 was for 0 units. Substantial in-transit inventory (657 units) exists, which the OR backend will subtract from the calculated base stock to determine the current order. Given the stability of the current summer regime, I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P13-P21) to capture the current mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the arrivals have been consistently following the promised 4-period window.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed cotton t-shirt), which is currently in its peak summer season. Historically, demand has stabilized in a 'summer baseline' regime since Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 22 is ~175 units per week (128, 171, 178, 239, 199, 151, 197, 196, 172, 154). While there was a stockout in Period 20, the arrivals in Period 21 and 22 have replenished on-hand inventory to 179 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as seen in Period 22's arrival of the Period 18 order). Given the stable summer demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand (approx 875-900 units) minus current pipeline inventory to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this $1 profit/$1 holding cost item.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed top), currently in late July (Period 24). Historical demand data and carry-over insights show that demand peaked in April/May (~240 units) and settled into a summer baseline (~186 units) through June and July. Recent demand (P21-P23) has shown a moderation (172, 154, 120), suggesting a late-summer slowdown as the season progresses. However, the last 8 periods (P16-P23) still average 179 units. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking from Period 13) to capture the stabilized summer regime while acknowledging the recent slight dip. For L, lead times have been consistent at the promised 4 periods (except for an missing P16 order which might be an OR backend decision of 0, or a loss; however, P17-P19 orders have arrived or are arriving on schedule). Current pipeline (in-transit: 557) plus on-hand (216) equals 773 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~170-180 and lead time of 4, the target inventory (L+1 weeks) should be around 850-900. I will maintain L=4 and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the summer regime to prevent stockouts while the OR backend manages the holding cost balance.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand moderation: Average demand for Period 21-23 decreased to 148.6 units, compared to the summer baseline of 186 units identified in Period 21.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'short-sleeved fitted tops' has entered a late-summer cooling phase. Average demand across the last four periods (P21-P24) is 144 units, a significant drop from the mid-summer baseline of ~186. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend (144 * (1+4) = 720). The actual lead time has stabilized at the promised 4 periods (observed in P21, P22, P23, and P24). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 297, In-transit: 439), totaling 736 units. Given the projected demand (mu_hat), we are well-covered for the lead-time window, and the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a very small or zero order this period to avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand decline confirmed: Average weekly demand for P21-P24 fell to 144 units, a 22% decrease from the previous 186-unit summer baseline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Carry-over insights and recent data confirm a sustained decline in demand for this short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee' as the peak summer season concludes. Average demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) is 132.4 units, significantly lower than the June/July summer baseline of ~186. Specifically, the last two periods recorded demand of 130 and 86, suggesting a further downward trend as we move towards autumn. With 250 units on-hand and 400 units in-transit (total pipeline of 650), we are currently overstocked relative to the projected demand for the 5-period window (L+1). Specifically, 5 periods of demand at the current average of ~132 would be 660 units, but at the most recent rate of ~86 units, it would only be 430 units. To prevent ballooning holding costs during this seasonal transition, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to reflect the recent demand drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved t-shirt) is entering mid-August, a period where summer demand typically tapers off as consumers shift focus toward fall merchandise. Recent history confirms a significant and sustained downward trend: demand dropped from the stable summer baseline of ~186 (P13-P20) to 144 (P21-P24), and further plummeted in the last two weeks (P25: 86, P26: 54). Current on-hand inventory (363) plus in-transit (245) equals 608 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of ~54-86 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs as the season ends, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) to capture this sharp deceleration. No additional ordering is likely necessary given the current stock levels, but recent_N allows the backend to adjust the base stock downward.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed: Weekly demand dropped from ~144 (late July) to an average of 70 units in early August (P25-P26), signalling the end of the peak selling season for this short-sleeved SKU.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for this short-sleeved baby tee is in a significant end-of-season decline. The last three periods (P25-P27) show demand values of 86, 54, and 56 units, averaging 65.3 units. This confirms the 'end-of-summer collapse' identified in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 447 units and 105 units in-transit (from P24 and P26), the total pipeline of 552 units already covers over 8 weeks of current demand levels (552 / 65.3 \u2248 8.4 periods). Since the decision lead time plus review is 5 periods (L+1), and there are already enough units to last through October, the OR backend should be set to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking and high holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this late-August floor.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved, ribbed cotton top), which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late August (Period 29), and demand has dropped significantly from the summer baseline of ~186 to an average of ~64 units over the last four periods (P25-P28: 86, 54, 56, 59). This confirms the 'End-of-summer demand collapse' noted in the Carry-over Insights. With 481 units on-hand and only ~60 units of weekly demand, we have approximately 8 weeks of stock, which far exceeds the lead time and the remaining peak season. Any further ordering would significantly increase holding costs without providing additional sales benefit. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=4) to prevent the OR engine from ordering more, while keeping L at default as the supply chain remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand regime stabilized: Average weekly demand for P25-P28 is 63.75 units, confirming a permanent decline from summer heights as the season transitions to autumn.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved tee) is in a clear end-of-season decline as of early September. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level: the average demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 63.2 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 420 units, and there are 12 additional units in transit. Given the current average demand, the 432 units total inventory covers approximately 6.8 weeks of demand, which exceeds the required coverage for the lead time (L+1 = 5 weeks). With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we should aim for a slimmer inventory profile to avoid excessive holding costs during the off-season. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime will ensure no new orders are placed until the on-hand inventory is depleted to safer levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in early September (Period 31), and historical demand shows a clear and sustained decline as summer ends. The latest demand in Period 30 was only 29 units, continuing the trend identified in the Carry-Over Insights (Period 27/29) of an end-of-summer collapse. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 403 units, which is more than enough to cover several weeks of demand at the current rate (~30-60 units/week). My goal is to minimize holding costs while the demand fades into autumn. I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (P27-P30), and will maintain the promised lead time of 4. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand, the OR backend will naturally stop ordering until stock levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition confirmed: Weekly demand has dropped significantly from the ~64 average in late August to 29 units in early September (Period 30), signaling a further decline as the season ends.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is experiencing a late-season demand collapse as evidenced by the drop from ~64 units/week in late August to an average of ~33 units/week in early September (Periods 30-31). Current inventory is very high at 365 units, which provides over 10 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. There are no units in-transit, and no new orders have been placed since Period 26. Given the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), and the clear downward seasonal trend into autumn, the priority is to liquidate existing stock rather than ordering more. I will set the lead time to the default 4 periods. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent decline (Periods 29, 30, and 31 which show demand of 61, 29, and 38 respectively, averaging 42.6). This will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*42.6 = 213. Since on-hand (365) + in-transit (0) = 365, and 365 > 213, the OR backend will correctly result in an order of 0 units, allowing the system to consume the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand decline: Weekly demand has averaged 33.5 units over the last two periods (P30-P31), confirming the end of the summer season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee') has entered its late autumn demand phase (as of 2019/9/23). Recent demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (P30-P32 average: 31.7 units/week) following the end-of-summer collapse. Current on-hand inventory is 337 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for ~10 weeks). There is 0 inventory in-transit (P26 order arrived in P30; P25 was an order of 0, and P27-P32 were orders of 0). This suggests no more arrivals are pending. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P30-P32) to capture the current autumn low. The on-hand inventory already exceeds any reasonable base stock level, so the OR backend will correctly output zero orders. Lead time (L) remains at the consistent 4-period default.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand decline as of late September (Period 34). Demand has stabilized at an autumn baseline of approximately 32 units per week (P30-P33 average is 31.75). Current on-hand inventory is 305 units, which covers approximately 9-10 weeks of current demand. With the promised lead time of 4 periods and the end of the peak season, the primary objective is to avoid incurring excessive holding costs while liquidating existing stock. No new orders are needed. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' based on historic performance (consistently 4 periods) and use a 'recent_N' approach for demand to capture the current low-volume regime (N=4 covers the last month of autumn demand).

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline confirmed: Average weekly demand for P30-P33 is 31.75 units, representing a stable low-season regime for this short-sleeved SKU.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn season (October 7th), and demand for this short-sleeved baby tee has stabilized at a low-season baseline. The average demand for the most recent period (P30-P34) is 32.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 268 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for this demand level (~164 units at a (L+1) horizon with L=4). Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this stable autumn demand of ~33 units/week and sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the low volatility observed in the current regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, entering mid-October (Period 36). Historical demand samples and carry-over insights confirm we are in a low-season autumn regime. The average weekly demand for the most recent stable period (P30-P35) is approximately 30.8 units (samples: 29, 38, 28, 32, 37, 21). On-hand inventory is currently 247 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * 30.8 units/week \u2248 154 units. Since our current on-hand inventory (247) significantly exceeds the required base stock (approx 154) and the seasonal trend for a short-sleeved item is likely to remain low or decrease further as winter approaches, I will continue with zero orders. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this autumn baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L as lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline remains stable: Average weekly demand for P30-P35 is 30.8 units, confirming the low-season regime for this short-sleeved SKU.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee', which is experiencing a stable low-season demand regime as autumn progresses (late October). Analysis of Period 30 through Period 36 shows a consistent autumn baseline with weekly demand averaging 31.1 units (samples: 29, 38, 28, 32, 37, 21, 33). On-hand inventory is currently 214 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover demand for approximately 5 periods (L+1), which totals roughly 155 units. Since on-hand inventory (214) already exceeds this coverage requirement and holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), the priority is to allow existing inventory to bleed down rather than ordering more. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 7-period autumn regime (recent_N=7) and maintain the default lead time. No order will be triggered because the pipeline exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved Baby Tee) is currently in a stable low-demand autumn regime. Historical data shows demand has stabilized since Period 30, with an average of approximately 32 units per week (P30-P37 average is 32.5). Current on-hand inventory is 172 units, which is sufficient to cover more than 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (172 / 32.5 \u2248 5.3 periods). Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods and the review period is 1, the system needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With 172 units on hand and 0 in-transit, the inventory position already exceeds the required base stock (approx 162 units). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stable autumn baseline (P30-P37) and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the low volatility observed during this period. L will remain at default as arrivals have consistently followed the 4-period lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is currently in its low-demand autumn/winter season. Current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a stable autumn baseline of approximately 30-35 units per week since Period 30. Recent demand (P34-P38) has been: 37, 21, 33, 42, 24, averaging 31.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 148 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 weeks of demand at the current rate (148 / 31.4 \u2248 4.7). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level q = 0.5 (since Profit=1 and Holding=1), the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that accounts for 5 periods of demand ((L+1) * mu). Since on-hand inventory + zero in-transit already roughly equals or exceeds this target, the OR engine will likely result in a zero or near-zero order. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized low-season regime starting from P31. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a stable low-demand autumn/winter regime. Since Period 30 (early September), demand has consistently averaged approximately 31 units per week (P30-P39 mean = 31.0). The most recent period (P39) showed a demand of 24 units, consistent with this baseline. On-hand inventory is 124 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 4 periods of future demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods (except for one likely lost shipment in Period 16). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand. We use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stable autumn regime observed since P30. I will maintain default lead time settings as the pipeline is clear and lead times are stable.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is currently in its low season (autumn/winter). Since Period 30, demand has stabilized into a consistent low-level regime. Analyzing the most recent demand (P30-P40), the average weekly demand is approximately 30.7 units (Sum: 338 over 11 periods). The on-hand inventory is 102 units, which covers over 3 weeks of demand at the current rate. With a lead time of 4 periods, total exposure is (L+1) = 5 periods, requiring roughly 154 units of pipeline stock (5 * ~31). Current total inventory (On-hand: 102 + In-transit: 30) is 132 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized autumn baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand regime has been very consistent for the last 11 periods. This will trigger the OR backend to maintain a safety stock level appropriate for the current low-volatility, low-demand environment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved baby tee, currently in late November (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at an autumn/winter low-season baseline. Carry-over insights and recent history (P30-P41) show an average weekly demand of approximately 29.8 units (calculated from P30-P41: 358 total / 12 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 84 units, with 48 units in-transit (ordered in P39, P40, and P41). Total pipeline inventory is 132 units. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a weekly demand of ~30, the total required stock for (L+1) periods is approximately 150 units. While the current pipeline (132) is slightly below this, the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0) suggests a conservative service level (q = 0.5), targeting the median demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods to capture the stable low-season regime and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) is in its low-season (autumn/winter) regime for the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has stabilized at a low level since approximately Period 30. Recent demand (P30-P42) shows an average of 29.5 units per week, which is significantly lower than the summer peak but consistent with the established 'autumn baseline' noted in carry-over insights. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P30). Current on-hand inventory is 56 units with 61 in-transit. Since on-hand inventory is steadily decreasing and we are currently in week 43 (early December), I will maintain the current low-season forecasting strategy. I am using recent_N (N=13, covering P30-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable low-demand window precisely, and keeping lead time at 'default' (4 periods). This ensures we maintain enough stock for the base demand while avoiding excessive holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Low-season baseline confirmed: Average weekly demand from Period 30 to Period 42 is 29.5 units, maintaining the stable autumn/winter regime for this short-sleeved SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved tee) is in its low-season autumn/winter regime. The average demand since Period 30 has stabilized around 29-30 units per week. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 24, 22, 18, 28, 16) follows this pattern closely, averaging 21.6 units. Lead times are stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived exactly at P43). With on-hand inventory at 52 units and 77 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43), the pipeline is sufficient for current low-season demand. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-season regime (P30-P43) while excluding the previous high-demand summer spikes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is in a stable low-season (autumn/winter) regime for short-sleeved shirts. The current date is December 16 (Period 45), roughly two weeks before the end of the game (Period 47). Demand has been consistently low, averaging 29.5 units since Period 30, and the most recent observations (P43: 16, P44: 15) suggest a slight further dip, though not yet a sustained regime shift. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. With 55 units on-hand and 70 in-transit (P41: 18, P42: 13, P43: 28, P44: 11), the total pipeline of 125 units covers over 4 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given the proximity to the project end (L+1 = 5 periods, but only ~3 periods remain in the game), I will maintain the current low-season parameters using recent_N to reflect the stable baseline while avoiding over-ordering before the game terminates.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (short-sleeved Brit Baby Tee) is currently in its low-season winter regime. The current date is December 23rd, 2019. Historical demand from Period 30 through Period 45 has been very stable, with a mean of 27.2 units and a standard deviation of 7.4 units. The recent average (P43-P45) is 19.6, slightly lower than the autumn average, which is expected during the mid-winter weeks. Lead times are consistently at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 45 units and in-transit is 63 units, totaling 108 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets (1+L) = 5 weeks of demand. With a weekly mean of ~27, the target should be around 135 units. Current inventory (108) is slightly below this, so the OR backend will likely trigger a small replenishment. I will use a recent_N of 16 (from P30 to P45) to capture the stable low-season regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time method.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486001 (short-sleeved tee) is in its stable low-season period (autumn/winter). Demand from Period 30 through Period 46 shows a very steady level with a mean of 27.6 units per week. Recent demand (P43-P46) has slightly fluctuated between 15 and 28 units, averaging 21.7, which is slightly lower than the long-term autumn average but within the expected variance. I am maintaining the lead time estimate at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistent with this timing (P39-P42 orders arrived exactly on schedule). Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level will be 50%, aiming to keep just enough inventory to cover expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the entire stable autumn regime starting from Period 30, to ensure the backend uses the most accurate mean and standard deviation for this seasonal phase.
