  "rationale": "This is Period 1. The product is a women's sports t-shirt (IZZY TEE). Based on the historical demand provided (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand started high (289) and stabilized between 122 and 201, with an average of approximately 185 units per week. The date is early February (2019/2/11). As we move into spring, demand for athletic wear typically increases. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 with my current inventory (0) and Period 6 with this order. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover the lead time pipeline plus current demand. Total units needed to cover P1-P5 (5 periods * ~185 units/period) is ~925 units. I will order 1000 units to establish an initial pipeline and safety stock, anticipating seasonal spring growth for sportswear.",
