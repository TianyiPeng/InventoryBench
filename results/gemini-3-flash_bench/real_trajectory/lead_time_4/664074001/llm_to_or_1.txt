Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 664074001, an 'airy jersey cr\xeape' top for women. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no orders yet and the on-hand inventory is 0, we need to establish a baseline order based on the provided historical demand samples (82, 52, 45, 99, 108). The mean of these 5 samples is 77.2, and the standard deviation is approximately 27.6. With a Lead Time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'default' methods will allow the backend to use the full sample set provided. No changepoints are detected yet as we are in the initial period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 105 units for the 'Charlie Top'. Since we started with 0 on-hand inventory, all demand was lost. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order of 124 units placed in Period 1 (visible in in-transit) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Current demand samples: 82, 52, 45, 99, 108 (pre-game) and 105 (Period 1). Average demand across these 6 samples is approximately 81.8. Given the product is a short-sleeved top in February, we are likely entering a spring season ramp-up. The recent demand (99, 108, 105) is significantly higher than earlier weeks. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent level (~104 units/period) and L=4. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the higher current demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (105 and 188) compared to the initial historical samples (averaging 77.2). This product is a 'Womens Tailoring' jersey top, and the late February/early March period typically sees a 'Spring/Summer transition' demand spike as customers update their work/social wardrobes. Given the demand is now trending significantly higher, I am switching to recent_N (N=2) to capture the trend of 146.5 units per week. Promised lead time (L) is 4, meaning the Period 1 order (124 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 236 in-transit; we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand until arrivals start. Using N=2 for mu_hat captures the recent regime shift accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: Mean increased from ~77 to ~146 (+90%) coinciding with Spring transition. Predicted lead time arrival for P1 order is P5.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Charlie Top) is a women's straight-cut top, and we are entering the Spring season (March), which explains the recent increase in demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, we do not expect the first shipment until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 480 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shifted significantly: from an initial mean of ~77 (pre-game samples) to an average of 145.3 over the last three periods (105, 188, 143). Given the stockout situation, I need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this higher demand regime, and I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Straight-cut top in airy jersey cr\xeape', strongly suggesting Spring/Summer seasonality. Historically, demand shifted upwards starting Period 1 (mean ~$134 over P1-P4 compared to ~$77 pre-game). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (124 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase. However, since the system resolution for Period 5 hasn't happened yet, on-hand is still 0 and 'arrived' for P1 will only be visible in the P5 conclude message (at the start of P6). We have 694 units in-transit (P1-P4 orders). Demand has been volatile (105, 188, 143, 100). I will use a 4-period recent average (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this higher Spring regime, and use the default lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean for P1-P4 is 134.0, significantly higher than pre-game average of 77.2 (+73%). Initial Spring transition lead time check pending Period 5 arrival resolution.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a short-sleeved 'airy jersey cr\xeape' top, which is highly seasonal as we move into Spring/Summer. The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5 with exactly the promised lead time of 4 periods (arrived P5 = 1 + 4). This confirms the lead time is stable at 4. Current on-hand is low (42) with a significant pipeline (in-transit: 623), but we must account for the high demand volatility. Demand since the start of the simulation (P1-P5) has averaged 123.6 units, compared to the pre-game baseline of 77.2. The recent decline in P4 (100) and P5 (82) suggests the initial burst may be stabilizing or fluctuates with weather/early Spring shopping, so I will use recent_N=5 (all game samples) to capture this higher-demand regime while weighting it against the most recent data. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current game demand average (P1-P5) is 123.6, maintaining the +60% increase over pre-game baseline (77.2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25), entering the core Spring season for the 'Charlie Top' (short sleeves, airy jersey). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current game demand (P1-P6) averages 118.8 units, which remains consistently higher than the pre-game baseline of 77.2 (+54%). While the last two periods (82, 95) were lower than the initial burst, the upcoming month of April typically sees peak Spring demand for jersey tops. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current game environment while hedging against the pre-game lower mean. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed volatility in-game. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as previous arrivals match the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's airy jersey cr\xeape top with short sleeves (Charlie Top), entering the peak spring/early summer season. Historical demand for the 7 periods of gameplay (P1-P7) shows a mean of 118.1 units (105, 188, 143, 100, 82, 95, 114), which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 77.2. Recent demand (P5-P7) has stabilized slightly lower than the initial P1-P2 spike but remains elevated at 97.0 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). The OR backend uses L+1 (5 periods) for replenishment. Current on-hand (189) + in-transit (366) = 555 units. Given the seasonal nature of the 'Charlie Top' in April, I expect demand to remain strong. I will use a recent demand window (N=7) to capture the gameplay regime shift, while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's spring/summer top. Historical demand in the game (P1-P8) shows a mean of 125 units, which is significantly higher (+62%) than the pre-game baseline of 77.2. Recent demand (P8) spiked to 173, likely reflecting seasonal interest as we enter April. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). On-hand inventory is 230, with 256 in-transit (P5-P8 orders). Total pipeline inventory is 486. Given lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the recent mean of 125, expected demand over 5 periods is 625. Our current pipeline (486) is below this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the 'default' promised lead time of 4, as it matches reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at an elevated mean (~125) compared to pre-game, with a possible secondary seasonal ramp-up in April (P8 demand 173). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Charlie Top' is an airy jersey cr\xeape top with short sleeves, fitting the Spring/Summer fashion cycle. We are currently at Period 10 (April 15). Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game baseline. The mean demand for the last 9 game periods is 123.5, though Period 8 showed a peak of 173, likely reflecting a mid-spring sales bump. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The current on-hand inventory (171) plus pipeline (392) totals 563. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~125/period, 625 units are required to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full game history demand regime (which is higher than the historical basement) while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods using the 'calculate' method.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a 'Charlie Top', a lightweight jersey cr\xeape top with short sleeves, which is coming into high season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift from a pre-game average of ~77 up to an average of ~123.4 during Periods 1-10. Recent demand (P7-P10) averages 130.25 units per period. The lead time is stable at exactly 4 periods. My strategy is to set L to 4 using the calculate method. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full sustained spring demand regime while ignoring the lower pre-game baseline. This protects against stockouts as we enter the peak warmer months. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the volatility observed during this higher-demand period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for the 'Charlie Top' (airy jersey cr\xeape, short sleeves). Demand has stabilized at a high level compared to the pre-game baseline. The mean demand for the game periods (P1-P11) is approximately 121.7 units, with the last 4 periods (P8-P11) averaging 128 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (43 units) while a large pipeline (534 units) exists. The OR backend needs parameters that maintain this high-demand service level. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to lead-time adjusted game-period demand (N=11), and sigma_hat similarly to capture game volatility. The pipeline will cover most of the base stock, but the mu_hat and sigma_hat must remain high to ensure the replenishment policy doesn't prematurely scale back before the seasonal peak ends.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product 'Charlie Top' (airy jersey cr\xeape with short sleeves) is entering its peak season in late spring/early summer. The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game baseline. Since Period 1, the average demand is 121.9. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 127.4, which better captures the current seasonal strength. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-12). Pipeline inventory (524 units) plus current on-hand (22 units) totals 546 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand at the recent average. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 637 units). Setting mu_hat using the last 12 samples (all in-game data) captures the sustained shift, while sigma_hat is set to default to handle general volatility. Lead time remains at the default (promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in-game (P1-P12) at a mean of ~122 (+58% over pre-game). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (Mid-May 2019). The product is a 'Charlie Top', a jersey cr\xeape boat neck top, which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. Historically, demand shifted from a pre-game mean of ~77 to an in-game mean of ~121.7 (P1-P13). Looking at recent data, there was a minor spike in early April (P8: 173), but demand has since stabilized between 93 and 125 over the last 4 periods (Avg: 111.25). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 118, and in-transit is 468 (total pipeline: 586). Since lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the in-game average (N=13) provides a robust mean estimate (~122) for the current regime, while a recent_N sigma calculation captures the current volatility. The target inventory level helps maintain a high service level for this profitable item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). The SKU is a 'Straight-cut top in airy jersey cr\xeape', which is a spring/summer item. Historical demand remains significantly higher than the pre-game baseline, with a mean of approximately 119 units per period during the game (P1-P14). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from P5 to P14. On-hand inventory is 142, with 382 units in-transit (P11-P14 orders), totaling 524 units of pipeline inventory. Given that (L+1) = 5 periods, and average demand is ~120, the pipeline inventory of 524 units is slightly below the target of ~600 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (the full game duration) to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 1 and use 'default' for L as the lead time is stable.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'Charlie Top', a short-sleeved airy jersey cr\xeape garment. Historical demand since Period 1 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 119.5 units per week (P1-P15), compared to the pre-game baseline of 77.2. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is very stable, averaging 107.2 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Since on-hand inventory (141) and in-transit units (391) are healthy, I am using 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full in-game demand regime shift while filtering out the much lower pre-game data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand) while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 80% service level target (implied by Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a lightweight women's top (Charlie Top), which is in its peak summer season. Historically, demand has been stable since Period 1, with a mean of approximately 121 units/period (Periods 1-16). Recent demand in Period 16 was slightly higher (139), but no sustained shift is evident yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We have 96 units on hand and 412 in transit (total 508), which covers about 4.2 periods of mean demand. Since Promised Lead Time (L) + 1 = 5, we are slightly below the target coverage. I will maintain L=4 (default) and use a recent_N window (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated in-game demand levels compared to the pre-game baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $786.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 18 (2019/06/10). The product is a lightweight summer top. Period 17 showed a massive demand spike (203 units), which is the highest recorded in the game so far, following a steady early June trend. This aligns with peak summer seasonality. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to use recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward trend immediately, as the trailing average of the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 131.6, while the most recent sample is significantly higher. Given the lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods total. The spike to 203 suggests that a simple trailing average might under-order if the heat/summer peak continues, so I am choosing N=5 to balance the recent volatility with the established regime, while the OR engine's service level logic (75% crit ratio) will naturally buffer against this higher variance (std is elevated due to the 203 value).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 17 (203 units, +60% vs. recent mean), likely corresponding to peak summer seasonality for jersey crepe tops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand period (Period 19, mid-June), which aligns with the product's description as a 'short sleeves' jersey crepe top. Demands in Period 17 (203) and Period 18 (194) confirm a significant upward shift from the previous regime mean of ~122. This represents a seasonal summer peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 38 units arriving last period, resulting in 130 lost sales. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand Window, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 3 periods (Periods 16-18) to capture this new mean (approx 179) and increased volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation responds quickly to the summer spike while the backend's capping mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering if the peak is short-lived.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed starting Period 17: Mean increased from ~122 to ~179 (+46%) for 664074001.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' (Womens Jersey Crepe Top) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand peaked at 203 in Period 17 and has stayed elevated (P18: 194, P19: 139). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is approximately 178.7, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~122. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P18 and P19) because arrivals (P14 order: 38, P15 order: 126) were insufficient to meet this summer peak. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in every 'conclude' message from P5 to P19). To address the stockout and capitalize on the summer seasonality, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observations.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21 (2019/7/1). The product is a summer jersey crepe top, currently in its peak demand season. A demand regime shift was confirmed starting Period 17 (Summer peak), but recent demand in Periods 19 (139 units) and 20 (93 units) shows a cooling from the Period 17 peak (203 units) and Period 18 peak (194 units). However, those recent low 'demand' figures might be influenced by stockouts in Periods 18/19 affecting visibility, although Period 20 had non-zero ending inventory. The average demand for the 'Summer Peak' regime (P17-P20) is ~157. Given the volatile summer demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this specific regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is very low (22), and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline of 821 units. Since demand is still in the summer window, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods of the summer peak to maintain a high enough base stock to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the slight cooling observed in the most recent two weeks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (July 8th). The product is a lightweight summer top. Analysis of the demand history shows a distinct summer peak starting around Period 17 (June 10th), with demand values of 203, 194, and 139. However, the last two periods (P20 and P21) have seen a drop to 93 and 85 respectively. This suggests the peak season for this breezy summer item may be starting to taper off as mid-summer passes. I will adjust the mu_hat calculation using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated summer mean while allowing the recent cooling to moderate the forecast. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full (716 units in transit), following aggressive ordering during the peak, so an update to the parameters is needed to ensure we don't over-order as demand softens while still protecting against the stockouts observed in P18 and P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering detected post-summer peak: Mean demand for P20-P21 dropped to ~89 from the P17-P19 peak average of ~178 (-50%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Charlie Top) is entering a post-summer demand phase. Demand in the last three periods (P20-P22) has averaged 99 units, a significant decrease from the summer peak (P17-P19) which averaged 178.6 units. This aligns with the seasonal tapering of 'airy jersey cr\xeape' tops as we move further into July. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 167 plus the high in-transit pipeline of 532 units (which includes large orders from the peak demand phase P19-P20) is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the new lower demand level. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend (averaging ~100 units/period) and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the volatility seen during this transition. This will signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the excessive pipeline inventory is cleared, minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Mean demand for P20-P22 is 99.0 units, down ~45% from the summer peak (P17-P19) of 178.6 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Women's Jersey Fancy Top) has exited its summer peak (P17-P19 mean ~179) and entered a post-peak cooling phase starting in Period 20. The mean demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) is 97.25 units, significantly lower than the preceding peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 311 units, which is roughly 3 periods of current demand. In-transit inventory is also high at 296 units, primarily consisting of large orders placed during the peak response window (P20-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels (total pipeline coverage is ~6 periods) and the downward demand trend, the OR backend should be guided to adjust the base stock down. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 97.25 mean demand and keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility to avoid over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for small fluctuations. The service level provided by the backend should naturally decrease order sizes as on-hand + in-transit already exceeds the likely needed base stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Women's jersey crepe top) has clearly entered a post-summer declining demand phase. Demand in the last two periods (92, 54) has dropped significantly from the summer peak (avg ~178). Specifically, the Period 24 demand of 54 is the lowest recorded in the game history, suggesting a return to or dip below the original pre-game mean (~77). Current on-hand inventory is very high (493 units) due to massive orders placed during the peak arriving now (lead time is stable at 4 periods). With 493 units on-hand and 60 in-transit, the pipeline (553) is extremely high relative to the current demand trend (recent mean for P23-P24 is 73). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will result in no new orders being placed to avoid excessive holding costs while the current mountain of inventory clears.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P20-P24 has dropped to 88.6 (compared to summer peak of 178), with the most recent Period 24 dropping to 54 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlie Top (a lightweight jersey crepe top) is clearly tapering off as summer concludes. The mean demand for the most recent 6 periods (P20-P25) has dropped to 86.8 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~178. The most recent demand (P24: 54, P25: 78) indicates a stabilization at a much lower level. With on-hand inventory currently at 455 units and a stable lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), and expected demand over the next 5 periods being approximately 400-450 units, the system is already at or slightly above the necessary base stock. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect this lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4) and sigma settings. This will likely result in zero new orders being placed by the OR backend, allowing the existing high on-hand inventory to be depleted, minimizing further holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Charlie Top) is experiencing a post-summer demand decline. Current date is August 12. Demand has significantly cooled from the June peak (~178 units) to a recent 7-period average (P20-P26) of 89.8 units. The most recent demand (P26) was 108, but the general trend since late July has been much lower. On-hand inventory is currently high (367 units) with zero units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. Our current on-hand inventory (367) already covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the recent average of ~90 units/period. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy; with high on-hand and declining demand, the 'cap' mechanism and the base-stock calculation will likely result in zero or very small orders, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit) given the lower profit margin ($4/unit) and seasonally fading demand. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak regime (P20-P26).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand for P20-P26 is 89.8 units, roughly half of the summer peak (P17-P19) mean of 178.6.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (Aug 19), demand for the Charlie Top remains in a stabilized post-summer cooling phase. The current mean demand for the period P20-P27 is approximately 90.0 units, consistently lower than the summer peak of ~178 units observed in June. The stock level is currently high (On-hand: 276) due to over-ordering during the summer peak transition. With a lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we are in a 'destocking' phase where on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover near-term demand. The most recent demand (P27: 91) aligns with our established post-peak regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 (P20-P27) to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to reflect the decreased volatility. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4 periods since the game began.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' (Charlie Top) has entered a stable post-summer demand regime. For the period P20-P28, the mean demand is 91.1 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~178 units. The most recent demand (P28: 110 units) suggests some weekly volatility but no significant upward trend. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P26, where a P22 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 166, with 211 units in-transit (orders from P27 and P28). Given the promised lead time of 4, the target inventory must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~91, the required pipeline is roughly 455 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 166 + in-transit 211 = 377) is slightly below this. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P20-P28) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable post-peak regime while smoothing out recent weekly fluctuations. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a buffer that accounts for the current volatility (std dev ~18 in this regime) while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Since Period 20, the demand mean has been approximately 92.8 units (P20-P29). Recent variability is moderate. On-hand inventory is currently low (48 units), but pipeline inventory is high (332 units), with deliveries from orders placed in Periods 27-29 expected in the coming periods (L=4). To prevent overstocking as we move further into the autumn season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 10 periods of demand data (N=10), covering the stabilization period after the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Charlie Top) is experiencing a period of stockout despite high in-transit inventory. As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are in a post-summer demand regime. Analysis of the 'Carry-over insights' and recent demand (P20-P30) shows the mean has stabilized around 90-100 units per period. Specifically, the mean demand from P20 to P30 is approximately 91.9 units. The most recent demand was 86 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 460 units, which consists of orders from P27 (122), P28 (89), P29 (121), and P30 (128). These are expected to arrive in Periods 31, 32, 33, and 34 respectively. Since on-hand is 0, the next arrival (P27 order) will satisfy Period 31 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (P20-P30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-summer regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P20-P30): Mean demand at ~92 units, significantly lower than the P17-P19 summer peak of ~178.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Charlie Top) is in Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019). We transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 178 units) to a post-summer stabilization regime around Period 20. For the last 12 periods (P20-P31), the mean demand has stabilized at 91.6 units. Period 31 demand was 92. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 30 units with 385 units in-transit. Since we are in a stable post-summer regime, I am using a recent window (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the lower stabilized demand (~92/week) compared to the earlier summer peak. This will help prevent over-ordering as we move further into the autumn season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a jersey cr\xeape boat neck top, which is entering the fall season in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand shows a stable post-summer regime established around Period 20, with a mean demand of approximately 92.2 units (calculated from P20 to P32). Recent demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 86, 92, and 96, confirming this stability with low volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P31 and P32). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 385 units, covering nearly 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the start of the post-summer regime at P20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand level while ignoring the summer peak and the initial pre-game/spring regimes. This ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio without overstocking as we move deeper into autumn.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' (Charlie Top) is a short-sleeved airy jersey crepe top, fitting the retail profile of a transition/summer item. We are currently at Period 34 (September 30), entering early autumn. Historically, demand for this item stabilized post-summer (P20-P30) at a mean of ~92 units. However, recent demand (P33) ticked up to 136. Looking at the last 4 periods (P30-P33), the average is 102.5. With on-hand inventory extremely low (8 units) and in-transit (359 units) reflecting recent orders (P30-P33), we need to maintain a steady replenishment. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use the recent 14 periods (P20-P33) to capture the post-peak stabilization mean of ~96 units while allowing for the slight upward variance observed recently. This provides a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand for SKU 664074001 has stabilized in the post-summer period (P20-P34). The mean demand for the last 15 periods (P20 onwards) is approximately 93.3 units. The most recent period (P34) saw a lower demand of 63, but demand remains volatile (ranging from 54 to 136). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P31-P34). Pipeline inventory (362 units) plus current on-hand (73) equals 435 units, which covers approximately 4.6 periods of average demand (approx 93/period). Given L=4, the coverage target (L+1) is 5 periods. With the current supply position slightly below 5 periods of demand, a subtle replenishment is appropriate. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer stable regime and filter out the high-demand summer peak (P17-P19).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand for the 'Charlie Top' (Womens Jersey Fancy) has stabilized into an autumn regime following the summer peak and subsequent decline. The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P25-P35) is approximately 85.5 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak (P17-P19) of ~179 units. Recent demand in the last two periods (P34-P35) has been lower (63 units), suggesting a potential further tapering as we transition deeper into October. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrival of orders from P27-P31). With 57 units on-hand and 394 units in-transit (covering orders from P32-P35), I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 7 periods (P29-P35, mean ~93) to capture the current stable-to-cooling trend while maintaining enough stock for a 4-period lead time. This N=7 window balances the very recent low demand with the slightly higher September levels. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P25-P35 is 85.5 units, significantly lower than the Summer peak mean of 178.6 units (-52%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/21. The demand for product 664074001 (Charlie Top) has stabilized into an autumn regime. Analyzing the demand from Period 30 to Period 36, the average is approx 79.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 27.8. This is significantly lower than the summer peak and represents a natural tapering for a short-sleeved airy jersey crepe top as we enter late October. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Pipeline inventory is currently 372 units (sum of orders from P33 to P36: 95+131+79+67). Given the current on-hand inventory of 92, the total inventory position is 464 units. At a mean demand of ~80 per period over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we expect to need ~400 units. Since the current position (464) is slightly higher than expected demand, the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to maintain the optimal service level without overstocking. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized autumn demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for the 'Charlie Top' (a short-sleeved jersey top) has entered an autumn decline/stabilization phase following its summer peak. The mean demand over the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is approximately 87 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~179. The most recent three periods (P35-P37) show an average of 64 units, suggesting a potential further softening as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Inventory position is healthy with 112 units on-hand and 288 in-transit. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand season while maintaining a service level for the $4 profit margin, I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods to capture the stabilized autumn mean, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39). The product is a jersey crepe top which exhibited a significant summer peak and has since transitioned into an autumn regime. Demand for the most recent period (P38) was 56 units. The mean demand for the 'autumn' regime (P34-P38) is approximately 62.2 units, a further drop from the earlier post-summer stabilization mean of ~92 units. On-hand inventory is 187 with 259 in transit (arriving P39-P42). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the downward trend as we approach winter for a short-sleeved top, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the lower autumn demand levels (62.2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. This will help prevent overstocking as the game nears its end (P47) and demand likely continues to soften or stay low.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P34-P38 dropped to ~62 units, compared to the P20-P30 stabilization mean of ~92 units (-32%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November), approaching the end of the game (P47). The product is a short-sleeved jersey crepe top, which is inherently seasonal (peaking in summer). Demand has declined significantly from the summer peak (~178 units) and the autumn stabilization level (~85 units). The most recent 5-period average (P35-P39) is approximately 59 units, confirming a winter slowdown. With an on-hand inventory of 218 units and 180 units in transit (expected in P40, P41, and P42), we are currently overstocked relative to current demand trends. The total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 398 units covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~60/period). Given the 4-period lead time and the game ending in Period 47, we must avoid further stock accumulation to minimize holding costs and end-of-game excess. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the localized downward trend (~60 units/period) and maintain L at 4 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P34-P39 dropped to 59.8 units, a 30% decrease from the early autumn mean (~85) and a 66% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (Charlie Top) is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we enter late November (Period 41). Demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~179) and early autumn stabilization (~90). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) is approximately 56.1 units. Specifically, the last two periods (P39-40) show a deeper decline to 48 and 34 units, indicating a winter low. With 251 units on-hand and 113 units in-transit (total pipeline of 364), and only 7 periods remaining in the game, our current inventory covers over 6 periods of demand at the recent mean of 56. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to reflect this winter regime (mean ~56) while allowing on-hand inventory to bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs at the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime solidified: Mean demand for P34-P40 is 56.1 units, a ~38% decrease from the early autumn period (P20-P30) and roughly ~70% lower than the summer peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Demand for the 'Charlie Top' (a jersey cr\xeape top with short sleeves) has entered a clear winter decline. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P34-P41) has dropped to 55.0 units, significantly lower than the autumn mean of ~85 units and the summer peak of ~178. Given the short-sleeve description, this downward trend is expected to persist or further decline as winter approaches. On-hand inventory is currently high (216 units) relative to recent demand, and there is an additional 102 units in-transit (ordered P38) arriving next period. Total pipeline (318) covers over 5.5 periods of demand at the current rate (55.0). To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (N=8) to capture this winter regime accurately. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4, as arrivals have been consistently on time.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P34-P41 dropped to 55.0 units (-35% from autumn baseline of ~85). Short-sleeve product profile suggests continued low demand through year-end.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The SKU 664074001 (Charlie Top) is a short-sleeved jersey cr\xeape boat-neck top. Historical demand data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: a Spring ramp-up, a Summer peak (Period 17-19, mean ~179), and a significant decline through Autumn and into Winter. The current 'Winter demand regime' (Period 34-42) shows a mean of approximately 55 units, which is a ~70% drop from the summer peak. The specific product description (short sleeves) and the calendar date (early December) strongly suggest demand will remain low for the remainder of the game (ending at Period 47). Currently, on-hand inventory is 268 units, with 0 units in-transit. At the current demand rate of ~55 units per period, the existing inventory covers approximately 4.8 periods, which is sufficient to meet demand through the end of the game (Period 47). To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 samples (since the start of the winter decline in P34) to reflect the lower demand accurately and ensure no new orders are triggered, as the OR backend will see that on-hand inventory exceeds the base stock calculation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664074001 (short-sleeved jersey top) is in a clear winter demand decline. Current date is Dec 9, and recent demand (P34-P43) has averaged 52.4 units, with the last period at 35. This confirms the 'Winter demand regime' noted in previous insights. On-hand inventory is 233 units, which provides over 4 periods of coverage at current demand levels. Pipeline inventory is minimal (26 units). Since we are at Period 44 of 47, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive at the very end of the game (Period 48 resolution), thus having zero impact on sales but incurring holding costs. Therefore, I am focusing on minimizing additional inventory. I will set the demand forecast using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the low winter mean (~52 units) while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering based on the high current stock level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). The product is a short-sleeved jersey crepe top, currently in its low-demand winter regime. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 34, with a recent mean (P34-P44) of approximately 51.8 units. The most recent demand (P44) was 61 units, slightly higher than the mean but consistent with low-season volatility. On-hand inventory is 172 units with 53 units in-transit (ordered in P43 and P44). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the next arrival is expected in Period 47. With around 225 total units available to cover the remaining periods and a demand rate of ~52 per period, we are sufficiently stocked for the end of the game (Period 47). I will set mu_hat using the last 11 periods (P34-P44) to capture this low-demand winter regime and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late December (Period 46: 2019/12/23). Recent demand has shown a surprising late-season uptick (P44: 61, P45: 102), diverging from the previously stable winter regime of ~55. This likely reflects holiday shopping for a 'Straight-cut top... with pleated trims'. Although the product is short-sleeved, high holiday demand (P45=102) necessitates a temporary adjustment to mu_hat to avoid stockouts, even as on-hand inventory is 70 and 118 units are in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this holiday peak (mean P43-P45: ~66, resulting in a base stock scaled for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for this recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 45 demand reached 102 units (+85% vs winter baseline), likely due to December gifting/seasonal events.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the holiday peak back into the start of the year. Historically, Period 1 (Feb) demand was around 105. The recent holiday spike (P45=102, P46=82) has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. There is 240 units in-transit: (P43: 26, P44: 27, P45: 65, P46: 122). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, P43 (26 units) is expected to arrive in Period 47's arrival resolution, which we cannot yet see. Since this is the final decision period (47/47), the objective is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. The product is a short-sleeved top; demand usually rises toward Spring (Feb-March). I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the holiday elevation for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend covers current demand levels, while maintaining the stable lead time of 4.
